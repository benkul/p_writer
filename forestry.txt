last night the great bird
was steady in his boat
I have got my shit together
and I am ready to go
oh but they way I been acting
i’d have to be lucky
last night the gray moon
i’m right down in this hole
how on earth did you get down here?
you say you know that still ain’t clear
but I have my shit together
and I was ready to go
I must be doing something wrong
gonna say this once for the both of us
there’s a lot of people out there you can’t trust
there’s a lot of people out there who don’t trust us
just get your shit together
get ready to go
everybody’s doing something wrong 
dark don't hide it
something held me down it made me make a promise
that I wouldn't tell if the truth forgets about us
saying it now comes easily
after finding out how you've been using me
at least the dark don't hide it
you only said you wanted friends
for long enough to get rid of them
you found the kind you knew would only kill you
so you surrounded yourself with them
at least the dark don't hide it
now the world was empty on the day when they made it
but heaven needed someplace to throw all the shit
human hearts and pain should never be separate
they wouldn't tear themselves apart both trying to fit
at least the dark don't hide it
now death is gonna hold us up in the mirror
and say we're so much alike we must be brothers
see I had a job to do but people like you
been doing it for me to one another
at least I don't hide it

night shift lullabye lay down
lay down lay down
no more running round
sleep away the morning hours
lay down lay down
sparrow sing ears ring
my baby doesn't hear a thing
work that long old night away
lay down sleep another day
lay down lay down
no more running round
sleep away the morning hours
lay down lay down
every muscle vein and bone
answers to that endless drone
I can hear my old machine
still running even in my dreams
lay down lay down
no more running round
sleep away the morning hours
lay down lay down

leave the city
broke my heart to leave the city
I mean it broke what wasn't broken in there already
thought of all my great reasons for leaving
now I can't think of any
it's true it was a hard time that I've come through
it's made me thankful for the blues
half my life spent on a highway
half my life I didn't choose
and I have seen the north star
shining in the freight yard
and I knew it was a hard time that it'd come through
it's made him thankful for the blues
it broke my heart to know you waited
I had so many things to do
it's true as far as a lot of stuff
you could have had a little better luck
you just called and just hung it up
one of us has had enough
it's true as far as a lot of stuff
you could have had a little better luck
you just called and just hung it up
baby both of us have had enough

hard to love a man
it was hard to love a man like you
goodbye was half the words you knew
while you was waiting for me not to call
I sent my love
in a life built out of only goodbye
is there even room for you to try
while you was waiting for me not to call
I sent my love
it was hard to love a man like you
goodbye is just what you do
in a life built out of only goodbye
is there even room for you
while you was waiting for me not to call
I sent my love

give something else away everyday
born to give it away
I'll take to my grave
no heart at all
I find a new kind every day
I will find in my grave
no new pain
it was easy making my self the same
it was easy making my self less
but to get better
that's the hardest thing
born to give it away
I will take to my grave
no heart at all
it's only the moon that breaks it
not your heart
it's only the moon that breaks it
not your heart
let the night in baby
not the dark

north star blues
where were the rest of my songs tonight
I only remember the north star blues
that simple old tune on the stage each night
marking the time that I lost you
no one should forgive me
I knew what I stood to lose
am I better off now
just forgetting how
I came to earn the north star blues
how can I be the only one
whose life can't live up to the lie
how can I be the only one
whose heart refuses to try
no one should forgive me
I knew what I stood to lose
am I better off now
just forgetting how
I came to have the north star blues
how can I be the only one
whose life can't live up to the lie
how can I be the only one
whose heart refused to try

hammer down
hammer down
heaven bound
I saw the light
on the old grey town
hammer down
heaven bound
sometimes I forget how I've always been sick
and I don't have the will to keep fighting it
hammer down
heaven bound
hammer down
heaven bound
when it's been my ghost on the empty road
I think the stars are just the neon lights
shining through the dance floor
of heaven on a saturday night
I saw the light
hammer down
heaven bound
hammer down
heaven bound
pyramid electric co
when the great pyramids
dragged themselves out to this spot
a sickness sank into the little one's heart
mama said son
that's just the cold
that's just the emptiness
it's being alone
in the dark
you'll get used to it
you'll have friends who won't come home
you'll see their bones
not separate yet from death
but you'll get used to it
you'll get used to it
we all get used to it
see the bloody arrow above us
see the blood that underlines it
dark repetition

red comet dust
the endless blue
shadow inside you
gathered in you
disappeared in you
into the solid earth
into the solid earth
I want to be true
like the solid earth
I want to be true
a red comet's dust
falls in the field
re-marking the trail
now you follow that trail
I want to be true
like the solid earth
the constant old witness
to accept what I see in it
what I think I see 
looking out at me
from the primal dust

division st girl
painted up division street girl
she's a pretty denim queen
bird of paradise eyes
bird of paradise dying eyes
but I could sight read those slangy lips
I could sight right those hips
and anyway out loud she says
hey sucker
are you lonely
well that's alright
you don't have to say anything
I can always tell when
you lost something big
something real big
well we all did
a jukebox in an empty room
conjures up the blues
they got my song on it
want to dance
cause it's just you and me and the gravity
you and me down on division street
and it's like we've landed on the enemy's side
and the other guys all quit
and they left us with nothing when they split
except the cold and the quiet
and the blues to sing about it

honey watch your ass
the smoke tastes like gray lead
it's killing her head
she finally let him have it
here practice yelling at yourself instead
she nearly burned the town again
with the look that she gave him
she covers her heart with her hands and says
a little useless praying never hurts anything
it's like nothing's got a pulse
in this whole damn place
right down to the clocks
nothing's got a pulse
remember darling how quiet it got
leave her alone let her go home
so she don't have to see you
how pathetic you can be
so she won't hate herself to death
know what I mean
she's covering he heart with her hands and says
a little useless praying never hurts anything
that must be her up there
perfume and cigarette smoke in her wild hair
she smells a little like a train
hauling lilacs through the rain
I can't tell that she's crying
I'll pretend again
but she sees them total destruction
as she goes running to them
I'm finally showing her the switch
how I learned to hold it
in my teeth
how she's got to keep
one razor sharp bloody piece
of her old broken heart
how she's got to use that edge to carve
across her new heart
something deep enough to hurt
so it always reminds her
deep enough to last
darlin' honey watch your ass

song of the road
the halos lights
look good with the ringing
fog bells
orion dead in the arc
but you can't tell
lead gray eclipse above
hiss of the snakes
rolling beside us
we are thrown into the shade
I think we'll be okay
the echo of the muffled drums
don't be overwhelmed by that
if you think this is hard work
you've never seen work
feel for your charm
take out your good luck
we're getting close to the edge
do what you know
do a good job
you're getting closer to the end
what do you know
I know the song of the road
the song of the road

spectral alphabet
emptiness and blue
beside the city moon
empty black cat eyes
cat's cradle eyes
keep an eye on you
heavy spanish moss
a hanging veil across the graceland get
the ancestors of the world
think it looks great
their names inscribed by death
in a spectral alphabet
their names look foreign
and they are forgotten by the world again
emptiness and blue
beside the city moon
the empty streets
hardly remember you
the rest of us do
a promise inscribed by death
in a sprectral alphabet
the words look foreign
and they are forgotten by the world again
what it says could that have kept us out of fiery hands 
the farewell transmission
the whole place is dark
every light on this side of the town
suddenly it all went down
now we'll all be brothers of the fossil fire of the sun
now we will all be sisters of the fossil blood of the moon
someone must have set us up
now they'll be working in the cold grey rock in the hot mill steam in the concrete
in the sirens and the silences now all the great set up hearts - all at once start to beat
after tonight if you don't want us to be a secret out of the past
I will resurrect it I'll have a good go at it
I'll streak his blood across my beak and dust my feathers with his ashes
I can feel his ghost breathing down my back
I will try and know whatever I try I will be gone but not forever
the real truth about it is no one gets it right
the real truth about it is we're all supposed to try
there ain't no end to the sands I've been trying to cross
the real truth about it is my kind of life's no better off
if I've got the maps or if I'm lost
the real truth about it is there ain't no end to the desert I'll cross
I've really known that all along
mama here comes midnight with the dead moon in its jaws
must be the big star about to fall
long dark blues
will o the wisp
the big star is falling
through the static and distance
a farewell transmission
listen

i’ve been riding with the ghost
while you was gone you must have done a lot of favors
you've got a whole lot of things I don't think
that you could ever have paid for
while you've been busy crying
about my past mistakes
I've been busy trying to make a change
I made a change
I've been riding with the ghost
I've been doing whatever he told me
I've been looking door to door to see
if there was someone who'd hold me
I never met a single one who didn't see through me
none of them could love me if they thought they might lose me
unless I made a change
see I ain't getting better I am only getting behind
I am standing on a crossroad trying to make up my mind
I'm trying to remember how it got so late
why every night pain comes from a different place
now something's got to change
I put my foot to the floor
to make up for the miles I've been losing
see I'm running out of things
I didn't even know I was using
and while you've been busy
learning how to complain
I've been busy learning
how to make a change
I made it almost again

just be simple
you never hear me talk about one day getting out
why put a new address on the same old loneliness
everybody knows where that is
we built that house of his
and when he's not home
someone else you know always is
if heaven's really coming back
I hope it has a heart attack
when they see how dangerous it is for guys like that
the night has always known when it's time to get going
when it's really been so long that it starts showing
it's always had that ghost who always almost
tells me the secret
how there's really no difference in who he was once
and who he's become
everything you hated me for honey there was so much more
I just didn't get busted
but I'm not looking for an easy way out
this whole life it's been about
try and try and try
and try and try and try
to be simple again

almost was good enough once
it's been hard doing anything
winter stuck around so long
I kept trying anyhow and I'm still trying now
just to keep working just to keep working
I remember when it didn't use to be so hard
this used to be impossible
a new season has to begin
I can feel it leaning in whispering nothing's lonely now
nothing anymore in pain
a tall shadow dressed how secrets always dress
when they want everyone to know that they 're around
leaning in whispering my friend over there
don't know what he's talking about
did you really believe
that everyone makes it out?
almost no one makes it out
I'm going to use that street to hide
from that human doubt
to hide from what was shining
and has finally burned us out
but if no one makes it out
how come you're talking to one right now
for once almost was good enough

the old black hen
old black hen is that you again
singing the bad luck lullaby
come right on in  it's midnight again
time for the bad luck lullaby
you know the one it's the same one you sung
when you wrote down the revelations
now sing it over the cradle of the child who's born next
leave all the truth in so they know what comes next
leave in the true love that they'll never find
show how we're looking for it all of our lives
when I saw the banner hanging over my door
I already knew who the party was for
all of my pain found a partner in that room
and the devil's tail swayed with the tune
make that black record
roll the tapes all night long
make that black record
and we'll all sing along
look down the long street
and see who's that crying
tell them that every day I lived
I was trying to sing the blues
the way I find them

peoria lunchbox blues
gwendolyn I wonder what you'd've called them
I think a name you might choose is nobody's blues
you see when you are just a kid
they think you won't remember what they did
they think you won't rememberbut you did
then you learned how to say everything you love
tries to get away
everything you love finally does
its finally looking good up there our skyline
see how if fits right in there with heaven
the constellations and comiskey's lights
two old friends in the night
who always knew they would if they could
meet one last time in the old neighborhood
hey wait a minute things ain't looking that good
its getting quiet and the light's getting dim
this ain't like no place I've ever been
what kind of trouble am I in?
oh gwen here they come again
it's nobody's blues
here they come again

john henry split my heart
I stood on the  hwy
wysteria magnolia beside the green line track
said don't come back
I found myself standing on the mountain
beneath my full moon heart
john henry split this heart split this full moon heart
swing the heaviest hammer you got
hit this one out of the park
he says boy what you going to do
with your heart in two
if its good enough
but only if its good enough
half I'm going to use
to pay this band
half I'm saving because I'm going to owe them
didn't it rain
no matter how dark the storm gets overhead
they say someone's watching from the calm at the edge
what about us when we're down here in it
we gotta watch our own backs
but if you do see that golden light
that it shines in its fiery eye
go on and catch it while you can
go on and catch it if you can
let it course through you
and let it burn through you
if it's the light of truth
if they think you got it they're going to beat it out of you
with work and debt whatever all else there is
you got to watch your own back
try to see the light of goodness burning down the track
through the blinding rain through the swaying wires
if I see you struggle I will not turn my back
I've seen a good man and a bad man down the same path
I've seen the light of truth keeping out of it and told them to watch their own backs
if I see you struggle and givin all that you got
I see you work all night burning your light to the last of its dim watts
I'm gonna help you how I can if you see me struggle all night
and give me a hand cause I'm in need I'll call you friend indeed
but I'm going to watch my own back
didn't it rain

steve albinI's blues
on the bridge out of hammond
see them brake lights burning feel my motor turnin
on the bridge out of hammond
see the big city moon
see how it close comes
watch my wiper blades pound it like a drum
on the bridge out of hammond
think about what's darkening my life
see the light of the afterworld shining on the ruins
it's the light of nowhere else burning to the west
see its sulphery shine
from the bridge out of hammond
see the big city moon 
between the radio towers
between the big diesel rigs
in the midwest's witching hour
I watch the whole town eclipse
from the bridge out of hammond

ring the bell
help does not just walk up to you I could have told you that
I'm not an idiot
I could have told you that
in every serpent's eye watch you go where you go
every serpents double tongue takes a turn with your soul
if you let them ring your bell
they're ringing the bell
why wouldn't I be trying to figure it out
everyone tells you that
everyone tells you not to quit
I can't even see it to fight it
if it looks like I'm not trying I don't care what it looks like
cause I stood at the alter and everything turned white
all I heard was the sound of the world coming down around me
why wouldn't I be trying
why wouldn't I try
cause those double tongues are singing hear the wail of the choir through the fog
the sound of that choir through the fog
they're always close they're always so close always close always so close
if there's a way out it will be step by step through the black
why wouldn't I be trying to figure it out it don't mean I'm not trying if I don't make it back
I know serpents will cross universes to circle around our necks
I know hounds will cross universes to circle around our feet
I know they're close
step by step one's beside me to kill me or to guide me
why wouldn't I be trying to figure which one out

cross the road molina
wolf headed conjurour in the cross roads
green eyes and alien chant brought the lightning down
set my pulse to the short waves pulse
set my pulse to the great lakes pulse
to wreath the moon in a head dress of neon flames
must take concentration from that heavy old bird
blue chicago moon swings like a blade above the midwest's heart
swings like a blade
swing that blade above us
show us how close it can get
show us close you can get
show us how fast we can lose it how bad we're out numbered
set my pulse an electric pulse
set my pulse to the blues
them black sad eyes
if I never see them again tell them goodbye
and I set my pulse to an electric pulse
I set my pulse to the blues
I send my pulse to the vixen's hearts
I concentrate like that heavy old bird

blue factory flame
when I die put my bones in an empty street to remind me of how it used to be
don't write my name on a stone bring a coleman lantern and a radio
cleveland game and two fishing poles and watch with me from the shore
ghostly steel and iron ore ships coming home
where I am paralyzed by the emptiness
clearly iron age beasts you can tell by the rust and the chains
and by the oil that they bleed the crew and crows fly the skulls and bones
they fly the colors of their homes I fly the cross of the blue factory flame
stitched with heavy sulpher thread/threat
they ain't proud colors but they're true colors of my home
where I am paralyzed by the emptiness
every mile for ten thousand miles and every year for a thousand years
every night for a thousand more I hear them calling
they never say to come home
where I am paralyzed by the emptiness

two blue lights
two blue lights
one's the blue light of the late night bus
one's the blue light of the moon over us
one's got the diesel fuel on her breath
one's got the damp taste of the earth on it
two blue lights
there's a dead archer in the tower you can't hear it but you can tell
when the bells ring twelve times in hell the bells ring twelve times in this town as well
two blue lights
lightning risked it all
still no guides
it's not a generous world
it is a separate world
the bad luck taste of the dark
the broad luck of blood on the water
I can see it will be red the choice if it is a choice
it's too hard to tell 
lightning standing drained and like us deeply risked it all
and like us deeply risked it all 

the body burned away
death as it shook you
you gave it a fool's look
you said I am an empty page to you
give me your hand give me you blood
don't misunderstand
I once had all the words
I forgot all the words
held the binding lightning
began to burn away
we began to burn away
held the binding the lightning x
began to burn away
the body burns away 

no limits on the words
put no limits on the words
simply to live that is my plan
in a city that breaks us
I will say nothing
I can tell that the shadow likes you still
like the memory my heart keeps remembering
that simply to live that was my plan
and I will say nothing

the ocean's nerves
this place is trouble waiting
the light hangs so weakly on to the quiet
drag myself in a long line
in a long line
in a lonely line
and I jealously want the ocean's deep nerve
I am a red flame hanging low to be close to it
hanging low to be close to you

not just a ghost's heart
after all this work she's still built to sail
the curve of the whole coast her curve's the whole coast
how she could read the map showing only the sea
only empty houses empty houses
are we still able at night to watch
with human heart's at all
how she could read the map showing only the bells
she's still able at night to watch
with a human heart
not just a ghost's heart
trouble will find you
trouble will find you
it's hard work to avoid you
it is the hardest work I know
whatever we are now seem hardly aware
of what we're used to being
of what we planned on being
and I'd trade it all
for you to come home

the moon undoes it all
in the dusk
bloody mane and tail
in the dawn
cold that aches in his belly
the sun that scarred his back
it was doubtful it would end
I came here out of common sense
the future enough behind me
and I stay here out of another sense
with the future enough in front of me
this one walks alone 
the silver wind makes a desperate effort to say
the moon undoes it all
this belongs to no one 
but you

darkness that strong
darkness that oblique darkness that strong
the moon in it's cradle is casual is distinct
from the stars
they are his father upon the land
and I made an estimate of the secret laid plan
and I make an estimate of the secret that they bare
when they are down here
darkness that oblique darkness that strong
and that is my report x

keep only one of us free
the space you gave to me
you marked out dividing lines
keep only one of us free
the frame that held me
has rotted away
now we are paired again
back with friction 
and black angel falls in with one of us again
and light is barely breathing its breath between us
between black angel black angel black
we have lost what we had marked
out for ambition
now only one of us are free
only one of us are free

the world at the end of the world
it runs the length of the world
and it gets heavy like woman's secret
and full of sorrow like a sudden thing
the ancestors of shadow the ancestors of smoke
the memory at night
the strength to face the world at the edge of the world

fire on the shore
shut you eyes across the uneven road
the sun shuts his eyes
he is asking everywhere for you
but I keep a wide eye open to the flame
tonight there is a fire
tonight there is a fire on the spanish shore
the fire is not my home it has come to be my home
and if the fire is not my home it has come to mean my home

mighty like love mighty like sorrow
a stray star yielding on her back
as much as she can
it is so hard
a stray star yielding on her back
do not leave me
it is dull hot hours
it is hurting like the winter
stars do spangle the sky here
and the moon is burning between us
and it is so hard
the weight of the distance comes down between us
mighty like love and mighty like sorrow
the black crow
through sparrow black wind
a dead crow calls out to his wing
we were lightning across the whole world
we were lightning
and the guise to black cats we made a cross when our shadows met
and the guise to black cats we made a pact when our shadows passed
through sparrow black wind
a dead crow calls out to its wings
I'm getting weaker I'm getting thin
I hate how obvious I have been
I'm getting weaker
and I look down and see the whole world
and it's fadingrepeat

tigress
it's difficult not to worry about what happens next
certain looks sort out confused looks
and certain looks sport confused looks
and I watched us talking in the mirror
and you put on that look
that says this little star wishes she weren't single
it is the eye that catches me a man protesting his worth
it is the year that catches you putting the shake on your words
you are alert as a tigress at a common table with her fate
you can almost taste it
we'll be gone be morning or be together by then
and I believe every woman has made up her mind to win

nervous bride
the women are dressed up and they are up to no good
you're dressed up for liberation
you flash that fire flag you fly above
the bright hot sails of your eyes
they say vaguely goodbye
there is a long delay in our words
then there are no words
and I lay down tonight as nervous as a bride
she's not nervous but she tries
and it's vaguely goodbye

being in love
being in love means you are completely broken
then put back together the one piece that was yours
is beating in your lovers breast
she says the same thing about hers
however I have gotten here I have plans to be with you
and for the first time it is working
and I am proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn
yeah we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn
what's left after that's all gone I hope to never learn
but if you stick with me you can help me
I'm sure we'll find new things to burn
cause we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn
yeah we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn

lioness
it is for me the eventual truth
of that look of the lioness to her man across the nile
it is that look of the lioness to her man across the nile
wanna feel my heart break if it must break in your jaws
want you to lick my blood off your paws
you can't get her fast enough
I will swim to you
whether you save you me
whether you savage me
want my last look to be the moon in your eyes
want my heart to break if it must break in your jaws
want you to lick my blood off your paws
it is for me the eventual truth
it is that look of the lioness to her man across the nile
and you can't get here fast enough
I will swim to yourepeat

coxcomb red
and I wanted that heat so bad
I could taste the fire on your breath
and I wanted in your storm so bad
I could taste the lightning on your breath
I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
he grew so pale next to you
the world is so pale next to you
your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
you said every road is a good road
between the next road and your last road
every love is your best love and every love is your last love
and every kiss is a goodbye
I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
he grew so pale next to you
the world is so pale next to you
your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black

back on top
there ain't nothing beyond hope
I've been thrashed by the hope of your body
I've been thrashed by the hope of your eyes
you looked me square in the eyes
you said don't take but one thing to be your truth
when I'm back on the top again
that is the truth
that is your truth
there ain't nothing beyond truth
I've been thrashed by the truth of your body
I've been thrashed by the truth of your eyes
you looked me square in the eyes
you said don't take but one thing to be your truth
when I'm back on the top again
that is the truth
the dark wrong turn
the moon and the owls reprise the ghost
and I'm even more afraid by its recent move
complete world beside him now
he lays a blue hand across a serious pale sky
and I now belong here
before they think of every endeavor
be it bright or be it subtle light
night and its insides sprawl across
the blue heart risin'
adding only black
to the face of a serious pale sky

ruby eyes in the fog
I have the courage to say I am confused
why you would build all of that up to tolerate
whatever will transpire in that place
and I have the courage to say it is
like separation a disease you should back away
how it lived so long
and I vow well enough to serve them well
though they produce invisible consequence
you can believe the regular way of words
their smallness and their trembling
they are small they are treacherous
when they are smallest they are treacherous
and I look straight through it like a line
and I have the courage to repeat it
but I respect it just enough not to repeat it

at certain hours it all breaks down
sooner or later a bright day comes
and it digs into the cellar of the darkest hearts
that it is more rare than it is true
at certain hours it all breaks down
you have less substance and less solid ground
you no longer suspiscious and you follow around
at certain hours it all breaks down
if you find me again open before you
and if you find me again with my head at the foot of the wall
I am sticking to what I personally saw
there were twelve of them
and they were circling around the image of me
and I was clad only in my faults
and I was in that hour all alone with twelve of them
and I was colorless the night was colorless but it had something
I wish I could find it again
the was made out of
so I left the city in the most subtle way

the wild wind
by the way you are behaving
I should be shaking my head
someone else will have to explain it
took at wind the dust was honest
took it in when the stars surround us
conversation is sloping off
and you know he must make a mistake
at this time they were slippery
and they were surrounded by them
and all they wore was their behavior
their bad behaviorbad behavior
you are looking humiliated
you say that I'm as naked as I am
as naked as a woman
naked as a man
and you must bring us half an hour
of good luck when you can
you must bring the appeal of laughter if you can
you're surrounded by a halo that is sloping offsloping off
you get that curious look clamped to your mouth
wipe it away with the back of your hand
you're back that way hating again
the falling light

the lost messenger
a little frightened of going near
a little distracted I hear
wouldn't you rather come back with me?
you never used to get worried and now I'm worried
it's never ending put it all away
that shit is never ending put it all away
when you aren't around you can never say you were trying to quit
you were trying to quit
that shit is never ending
you're already surrounded
that shit is never ending and you're already surrounded
and I ask and I am worried
you asked so I said I was frightened

one harrowing night
will that look be your only reply
you lower your head in reply
you mimic with your eye the moon
here it is white and full like a pale ghost across the sky
and here it is crescent like a dagger from your heart into mine
here it is just a spark to shine

you are not alone on the road
there is a silent role call that greets us in this bed
tonight it's waiting
still it's waiting for one of us
what about the one with the sharp edged mouth and eyes
the one that looked into me with the irresponsible look
the one that now is saying
I must depend on something
she whispered her future lover's name

why are we stopping in the storm
a resolute moment returns
and that's how close I got to you
it's as red as the target heart
even the sky's been influenced by you
and it ends all that doubt
it's true for any or all of us
there's never a good night to be
everything I've ever loved is here tonight
or the wish that it was here tonight is here tonight
everything that you need for truth is here tonight
or at least the wish for it is here tonight
and I am taken my chance here tonight
on that target heart
it is red as the target's heart
even the sky was influenced by you
see how the self can be made and remade
but the truth can either be made but can't be remade
love can't be made or remade

the far end of the bridge
there's a night that's a good night
for letting your friends down
there's never a good night for being cheap
there ain't never a good night for ripping people off
but there ain't no law against it
there has never been a good night for letting you friends down
there has never been a good night for being cheap
there has never been a good night for ripping people off
but there ain't no law against it
obviously you don't see no law against it
obviously you haven't seen nothing wrong with it
hot black silk
there will be trouble with me
there will be trouble more than these
and I warned you
ten times of these things
there ain't nothin' short of wisdom
in your hot black silk
and there won't be more
than one of me
is the only thing I can ever promise you
and I make enough lovin'
for three of me
there ain't nothin short of wisdom
in your hot black silk

captain badass
departure and worry
still shakes me
resistance failed
and friendship failed
as lovers we did not fail
brown eyes your pulse is getting hotter
brown eyes your pulse is getting quicker
quote captain badass
 I am setting you heart on fire
so when you leave me
I will burn on in your soul
you won't have to think twice
if it's love you will know
we get no second chance in this life
so a hot pulse is alright
so a quick pulse is alright
so a hot kiss is alright
so a long kiss is alright
so a long night is alright
and all night is alright
there ain't no contest
against the final day
we'll rise above us either way
we're either greeted
by life or its reverse
then each day greeted
by fortune or its reverse
will you stand up for your one chance
will you stand up for love
we get no second chance in this life
you won't have to think twice if its love
you will know

love and work
there are gaps between the light
and the dark roads we are on
no gaps between what's right
and the need that we have
somewhere under am
there is the room and
the events in this room
there is the dark
and these events in the dark
there is love and work and lovers work
love and work
and it took all of my strength
to ignore the need to stay
and it took all of my strength
to leave you either way
and we are constellations
in our own way
and there are these
three degrees of merit to us
there is love and work and lovers work
love and work

come back to your man
coaxingly closing to dangerous eyes
they hang their lighted
she feels the effort of h-a-n-d's
she feels the effort of e-y-e's
she feels the effort of l-i-e's
fumble across her
there are demands on spirit and flesh
and I've made the effort to survive them
now come back to your man

love leaves its abuser
you must have heard
that voice loud and plain
through all the thunder I surrounded you in
and I once had cause
and I once had strength
but I have been selfish
to say the least
I owned up to this
though leaving is a curious way
for you to love me
so my life and my whole waiting guilt
I enclose late with my dues to you
love leaves its abuser

champion
she with all her reasons
hardly spoke two words
let what's left of this relation
find its way to swiftest decay
let us rest in the decisions of this hour
champion
there are no claims on you

red head
the broken times
self-confidence must be
it's obviously
selfish to preserve
and selfish to pursue
I guess it's the proper way
to go on to loving
begin with nothing
and so here's the state
that love's left me in
in the estate of the redhead
and what does she mean
she don't need the proof
of my failures
or all the nights when
I earned my failure
and I suppose
I've not been rejected
and I suppose
we've not been a failure
and I suppose that we're proof of it

how to be perfect men
suppose my life has its plan
I choose to have women write my plan
and I have my reasons
they'll write that list
of all that I should be
and perfect men would never be
jealous or desperate
my ghost and I in our grave will lie
and we'll read that plan
on how to be perfect man
if anyone succeeds you
this will be her song to know that
I will get it wrong
be mine
'till you're reminded of something better
be mine
until it comes along
be mine
'till you're reminded of something better
until it comes along

the boats they've pawned for stranding
we will drown them like their anchors

there are fewer greater former ghosts

instead you would trade our mission for mission words
our several months alliance divergent invitations

so I may go around : or :

so then I have to be going

but not a second chance
close to the citadel will hasten to affirm
for this congress we have ridden doubly against
and we'll grow suspect
as soon as their friendliness rises

an attempt of the old position
they impose their pushing in steep heroics
these fine others
I owe my lifted tho' wounded head
and every side of you to a man
there have been signals
these are now joined by a future
and only say which decayed
not live opposite the failed republic
time will meet and pass you by

my blood's courage courses to rendezvous

my dying breath
set yourself down on the dewy ground at dawn
and there point yourself with your back to the sun

spend the lives that rise between us
we were once so constant
if you have been to constant

perhaps I will join that posture
you have braced around your smile

sailor dogwood gap
how goes it soldier
I'm too young to muster
though I know brown bonnet
who sweats like a soldier
when her boots come riding
on those nights that seem like the devil is riding
my halo for sabers over his shoulder
and he brings to me the rope and saw
one put to hang in put one to save in
and how goes it sailor I'm unwell for sailing
though I know the captain's bride
cause she comes to me and
she's handsome and wild as a hawk
and how goes it sister I do hate be botherin'
though I know you hate the fiends
they come to you and they're bearin' friendship
no lies could more have been
you come to me and
you're handsome you're wild as a hawk

an abuse of mercy is the action of

the stars that glow from port to portland

unless a friend were in deed to labor
his life alongside his greatest hazard
they'red always be room for you

sin and death blue jay
it seems that the older inhabitors never got out of you
the phantom broods were wronged in body
and in a state they will make their soon escape
by building a new inheiritence
it's likely more not to be

and as for liberty she will work or she will suffer
I am dense with the light of women
and I insist I'm not confused
I will not be going

fortunate man conscript or little beaver
conscript fathers when they were by to see

as well as on the first occasion as well as in the end
only then could I regret my service as a fortunate man
who's a fortunate man

runs for it blue stone
alone or in company the city makes me nervous
you know I'd rather be
with little sorrel or your house
or a little bit further
where I'd be standing with my reassurer
such an engine speaks such gear words
a sight for a civillians prayer
an american on the dorsett shore
runs for it
to risk the pathetic again tonight
such poverty compells us to perfect our pride
run for it
so you can see to go there will be distance
spoken word intro by darcie schoenman
wonder what that could mean
there will be distance
distance meet anxiety
anxiety meet the cold
the thing is still you will be gone and
I'll have to leave the lights on
so you can see to go

the arrogant truth it’s your win again

and let us hope
this lessens its whole appearance like truth
the arrogant truth

good luck darling may god bless you

goodnight lover
you mistrusted what will bleed
what will not die will not leave
the heart was first in that line
though it was under those conditions
we were free
under those conditions
of pain that would not leave
you were all I ever trusted
you're self made
you made it on hard work and risk
hard work
how will I live on without you
without your customs
of working and thinking action through
these days are obvious to you budgetive
how selflish for time to conclude
what would be the day
for leaving to work it's charm on you
and I can tell by that look
you were thinking the same thing to
if this can't last just what can last
then it's lights out after this kiss
then time can't torment us
this will have to serve
goodnight lover
wherever you are
a widow sang the stars down
I know about how bleak it all can seem
when you look at good or bad
you say this is what I had
and I know it is ambitious but it's still the truth
I have something that's lasting in a man
my heart has survived an order through the ruins
the shadow and it's promise vibrates across the room
you said it's savage but it's my duty
to build something precious than to kill something precious
then the shadow and then the promise clearly lost its nerve
don't leave me now
just say you're practicing for how you would say goodbye
don't leave me now
baby take a look
baby take a look
look at your man
do I look like a man who doesn't understand
you are the one true thing
in a world full of untrue things
if you're down on your luck
I will hold till better times
so baby take that look
look at your man
do I look like a man who doesn't understand
you are the one

just a spark
will that look be your only reply
you lower your head in reply
here it is white and full like a pale ghost across the sky
and here it is crescent like a dagger from your heart into mine
here it is just a spark to shine
the one red star
blue news in the heart
you are the one red sister star
you are the flash across the water
one red sister star
black has marked the distance
black has marked out all the miles
across the world from you
and I'm afraid right down the middle
I am afraid right down the middle
it is black it is yellow
and it is black pittsburgh yellow
your soul the one red star
I am the one red star sister star

whenever I have done a thing in flames
in any house in the world there is background of flames
in any house in the world there is background of storms
and any house in the world a winter spent alone
wherever I have done a thing for love it has ruined me
rebuild the day out of flames
rebuild the day out of the silence of that day
I'm going to choose I will have to choose
whenever I have done a thing in flames
it has saved me
incantation
the sound of our feet against the road
it spreads through the night
and the city's ending
speak to me if we're near the bottom
work it out with me
caution like the moon hangs on the tracks
blood and the lightning hangs on the tracks and
it spreads through the night
to where the city's ending
an absent star
worked it out with me
spreads through the night
blue chicago moon
out of the ruins
blood grown heavy from his past
his wings stripped by thunder
but those storms keep coming back
singing birds in sickness
sing the same blues songs
when they fell out of the emptiness
they must have brought along
space's loneliness
gotten so good at hiding it
even he does not admit it
that glittering flash in his eyes
makes it look like he might be alright
if the blues are you hunter
then you will come face to face
with that darkness and desolation
and the endless depression
but you are not helpless
and you are not helpless
try to beat it
and live through space's loneliness
you are not helpless
I'll help you to try to beat it
hold on magnolia
hold on magnolia to that great highway moon
no one has to be that strong
but if you're stubborn like me
I know what you're trying to be
hold on magnolia I hear that station bell ring
you might be holding the last light I see
before the dark finally gets a hold of me
hold on magnolia I know what a true friend you've been
in my life I have had my doubts
but tonight I think I've worked it out with all of them
hold on magnolia to the thunder and the rain
to the lightning that has just signed my name to the bottom line
hold on magnolia I hear that lonesome whistle whine
hold on magnolia
I think its almost time
long desert train
yu used to love a lot of things
you used to love talking
this you never told me about
if it's what your eyes were saying
I already figured it out
I could just tell it was bad
I couldn't tell how bad
you never took off your shades
and you stayed like that for days
I guess your pain never weakened
your cool blood started burning
scorching most of us in the flames
but there are things you can't change
there are things you can't change
you called that the curse of a human's life
that you couldn't change
said you'd never be old enough
or young enough
tall enough
or thin enough
or smart enough
or brave enough
rich enough
pretty enough
strong enough
good enough
well you were to us
you wanted silence by itself
just the word
you wanted peace by itself
just to learn
there were things you couldn't change
you got the dull pounding rain
you got the last car in the long desert train
you almost made it
you almost made it again 
I can not have seen the light
again you're swinging low
and you hit me below the belt
alright since it's a fair fight
I'd say it's the best that I have felt
in a long long time
every now and then it happens again
I can't remember what comes first
is it the hurt
or knowing that it hurts
is it the hurt
or knowing that it hurts
ever since I turned my life around
it still happens time to time
don't know what pain was yours
or what pain was mine
what pain was yours
and what pain was mine
will I have to be alright all of the time
no one has to be alright all of the time
do I have to be alright all of the time
I thought I saw the light
I saw the light


at paris just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of - I was
enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum in company
with my friend auguste dupin in his little back library or
book-closet au troisiême no  rue dunôt faubourg st germain for
one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence while each to
any casual observer might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied
with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the
chamber for myself however I was mentally discussing certain topics
which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period
of the evening I mean the affair of the rue morgue and the mystery
attending the murder of marie rogêt I looked upon it therefore as
something of a coincidence when the door of our apartment was thrown
open and admitted our old acquaintance monsieur the prefect of the
parisian police

we gave him a hearty welcome for there was nearly half as much of the
entertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we had not seen
him for several years we had been sitting in the dark and dupin now
arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp but sat down again without
doing so upon gs saying that he had called to consult us or rather
to ask the opinion of my friend about some official business which had
occasioned a great deal of trouble

if it is any point requiring reflection observed dupin as he
forebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better purpose in
the dark

that is another of your odd notions said the prefect who had a
fashion of calling every thing odd that was beyond his comprehension
and thus lived amid an absolute legion of oddities

very true said dupin as he supplied his visiter with a pipe and
rolled towards him a comfortable chair

and what is the difficulty now I asked nothing more in the
assassination way I hope

oh no nothing of that nature the fact is the business is very simple
indeed and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well
ourselves but then I thought dupin would like to hear the details of
it because it is so excessively odd

simple and odd said dupin

why yes and not exactly that either the fact is we have all been
a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles us
altogether

perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at
fault said my friend

what nonsense you do talk replied the prefect laughing heartily

perhaps the mystery is a little too plain said dupin

oh good heavens who ever heard of such an idea

a little too self-evident

ha ha ha ha ha ha ho ho ho roared our visiter profoundly
amused oh dupin you will be the death of me yet

and what after all is the matter on hand I asked

why I will tell you replied the prefect as he gave a long steady
and contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair I will tell
you in a few words but before I begin let me caution you that this
is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that I should most
probably lose the position I now hold were it known that I confided it
to any one

proceed said i

or not said dupin

well then I have received personal information from a very high
quarter that a certain document of the last importance has been
purloined from the royal apartments the individual who purloined it is
known this beyond a doubt he was seen to take it it is known also
that it still remains in his possession

how is this known asked dupin

it is clearly inferred replied the prefect from the nature of the
document and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at
once arise from its passing out of the robbers possession that is to
say from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it

be a little more explicit I said

well I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder
a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely
valuable the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy

still I do not quite understand said dupin

no well the disclosure of the document to a third person who shall
be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of most
exalted station and this fact gives the holder of the document an
ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so
jeopardized

but this ascendancy I interposed would depend upon the robbers
knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber who would dare 

the thief said g is the minister d  who dares all things those
unbecoming as well as those becoming a man the method of the theft was
not less ingenious than bold the document in question a letter to
be frank had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the
royal boudoir during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the
entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her
wish to conceal it after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in
a drawer she was forced to place it open as it was upon a table the
address however was uppermost and the contents thus unexposed the
letter escaped notice at this juncture enters the minister d  his
lynx eye immediately perceives the paper recognises the handwriting
of the address observes the confusion of the personage addressed and
fathoms her secret after some business transactions hurried through in
his ordinary manner he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one
in question opens it pretends to read it and then places it in
close juxtaposition to the other again he converses for some fifteen
minutes upon the public affairs at length in taking leave he takes
also from the table the letter to which he had no claim its rightful
owner saw but of course dared not call attention to the act in the
presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow the minister
decamped leaving his own letter one of no importance upon the table

here then said dupin to me you have precisely what you demand
to make the ascendancy complete the robbers knowledge of the losers
knowledge of the robber

yes replied the prefect and the power thus attained has for some
months past been wielded for political purposes to a very dangerous
extent the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day of
the necessity of reclaiming her letter but this of course cannot be
done openly in fine driven to despair she has committed the matter to
me

than whom said dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no more
sagacious agent could I suppose be desired or even imagined

you flatter me replied the prefect but it is possible that some
such opinion may have been entertained

it is clear said I as you observe that the letter is still in
possession of the minister since it is this possession and not any
employment of the letter which bestows the power with the employment
the power departs

true said g and upon this conviction I proceeded my first care
was to make thorough search of the ministers hotel and here my chief
embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge
beyond all things I have been warned of the danger which would result
from giving him reason to suspect our design

but said I you are quite au fait in these investigations the
parisian police have done this thing often before

o yes and for this reason I did not despair the habits of the
minister gave me too a great advantage he is frequently absent from
home all night his servants are by no means numerous they sleep at a
distance from their masters apartment and being chiefly neapolitans
are readily made drunk I have keys as you know with which I can
open any chamber or cabinet in paris for three months a night has
not passed during the greater part of which I have not been engaged
personally in ransacking the d  hotel my honor is interested and to
mention a great secret the reward is enormous so I did not abandon
the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more
astute man than myself I fancy that I have investigated every nook and
corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be
concealed

but is it not possible I suggested that although the letter may
be in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may have
concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises

this is barely possible said dupin the present peculiar condition
of affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which d 
is known to be involved would render the instant availability of the
document its susceptibility of being produced at a moments notice a
point of nearly equal importance with its possession

its susceptibility of being produced said i

that is to say of being destroyed said dupin

true I observed the paper is clearly then upon the premises as for
its being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as out
of the question

entirely said the prefect he has been twice waylaid as if by
footpads and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection

you might have spared yourself this trouble said dupin d  i
presume is not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipated
these waylayings as a matter of course

not altogether a fool said g but then hes a poet which I take to
be only one remove from a fool

true said dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff from
his meerschaum although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself

suppose you detail said I the particulars of your search

why the fact is we took our time and we searched every where I have
had long experience in these affairs I took the entire building room
by room devoting the nights of a whole week to each we examined
first the furniture of each apartment we opened every possible drawer
and I presume you know that to a properly trained police agent such a
thing as a secret drawer is impossible any man is a dolt who permits a
secret drawer to escape him in a search of this kind the thing is so
plain there is a certain amount of bulk of space to be accounted for
in every cabinet then we have accurate rules the fiftieth part of a
line could not escape us after the cabinets we took the chairs the
cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ
from the tables we removed the tops

why so

sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece of
furniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article then
the leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity and the
top replaced the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same
way

but could not the cavity be detected by sounding I asked

by no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient wadding
of cotton be placed around it besides in our case we were obliged to
proceed without noise

but you could not have removed you could not have taken to pieces all
articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a
deposit in the manner you mention a letter may be compressed into
a thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from a large
knitting-needle and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of
a chair for example you did not take to pieces all the chairs

certainly not but we did better we examined the rungs of every
chair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description of
furniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope had there been
any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it
instantly a single grain of gimlet-dust for example would have been
as obvious as an apple any disorder in the glueing any unusual gaping
in the joints would have sufficed to insure detection

I presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the plates
and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes as well as the curtains and
carpets

that of course and when we had absolutely completed every particle of
the furniture in this way then we examined the house itself we divided
its entire surface into compartments which we numbered so that
none might be missed then we scrutinized each individual square inch
throughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoining
with the microscope as before

the two houses adjoining I exclaimed you must have had a great deal
of trouble

we had but the reward offered is prodigious

you include the grounds about the houses

all the grounds are paved with brick they gave us comparatively
little trouble we examined the moss between the bricks and found it
undisturbed

you looked among d s papers of course and into the books of the
library

certainly we opened every package and parcel we not only opened
every book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not contenting
ourselves with a mere shake according to the fashion of some of our
police officers we also measured the thickness of every book-cover
with the most accurate admeasurement and applied to each the most
jealous scrutiny of the microscope had any of the bindings been
recently meddled with it would have been utterly impossible that the
fact should have escaped observation some five or six volumes just
from the hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally with
the needles

you explored the floors beneath the carpets

beyond doubt we removed every carpet and examined the boards with the
microscope

and the paper on the walls

yes

you looked into the cellars

we did

then I said you have been making a miscalculation and the letter
is not upon the premises as you suppose

I fear you are right there said the prefect and now dupin what
would you advise me to do

to make a thorough re-search of the premises

that is absolutely needless replied g  I am not more sure that i
breathe than I am that the letter is not at the hotel

I have no better advice to give you said dupin you have of course
an accurate description of the letter

oh yes and here the prefect producing a memorandum-book proceeded
to read aloud a minute account of the internal and especially of the
external appearance of the missing document soon after finishing
the perusal of this description he took his departure more entirely
depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before in
about a month afterwards he paid us another visit and found us occupied
very nearly as before he took a pipe and a chair and entered into some
ordinary conversation at length I said 

well but g  what of the purloined letter I presume you have at
last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the
minister

confound him say I yes I made the re-examination however as dupin
suggested but it was all labor lost as I knew it would be

how much was the reward offered did you say asked dupin

why a very great deal a very liberal reward I dont like to say how
much precisely but one thing I will say that I wouldnt mind giving
my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could
obtain me that letter the fact is it is becoming of more and more
importance every day and the reward has been lately doubled if it were
trebled however I could do no more than I have done

why yes said dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of his
meerschaum I really think g  you have not exerted yourself to the
utmost in this matter you might do a little more I think eh

how in what way

why puff puff you might puff puff employ counsel in the
matter eh puff puff puff do you remember the story they tell of
abernethy

no hang abernethy

to be sure hang him and welcome but once upon a time a certain rich
miser conceived the design of spunging upon this abernethy for a medical
opinion getting up for this purpose an ordinary conversation in a
private company he insinuated his case to the physician as that of an
imaginary individual

we will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such and
such now doctor what would you have directed him to take

take said abernethy why take advice to be sure

but said the prefect a little discomposed I am perfectly willing
to take advice and to pay for it I would really give fifty thousand
francs to any one who would aid me in the matter

in that case replied dupin opening a drawer and producing
a check-book you may as well fill me up a check for the amount
mentioned when you have signed it I will hand you the letter

I was astounded the prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken
for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless looking
incredulously at my friend with open mouth and eyes that seemed
starting from their sockets then apparently recovering himself in some
measure he seized a pen and after several pauses and vacant stares
finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs and
handed it across the table to dupin the latter examined it carefully
and deposited it in his pocket-book then unlocking an escritoire took
thence a letter and gave it to the prefect this functionary grasped it
in a perfect agony of joy opened it with a trembling hand cast a rapid
glance at its contents and then scrambling and struggling to the
door rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house
without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill
up the check

when he had gone my friend entered into some explanations

the parisian police he said are exceedingly able in their way
they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed in the
knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand thus when g 
detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d 
I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory
investigation so far as his labors extended

so far as his labors extended said i

yes said dupin the measures adopted were not only the best of
their kind but carried out to absolute perfection had the letter been
deposited within the range of their search these fellows would beyond
a question have found it

I merely laughed but he seemed quite serious in all that he said

the measures then he continued were good in their kind and well
executed their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and
to the man a certain set of highly ingenious resources are with the
prefect a sort of procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his
designs but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for
the matter in hand and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he i
knew one about eight years of age whose success at guessing in the game
of even and odd attracted universal admiration this game is simple
and is played with marbles one player holds in his hand a number of
these toys and demands of another whether that number is even or odd
if the guess is right the guesser wins one if wrong he loses one the
boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school of course he
had some principle of guessing and this lay in mere observation and
admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents for example an arrant
simpleton is his opponent and holding up his closed hand asks are
they even or odd our schoolboy replies odd and loses but upon the
second trial he wins for he then says to himself the simpleton
had them even upon the first trial and his amount of cunning is just
sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second I will therefore
guess odd he guesses odd and wins now with a simpleton a degree
above the first he would have reasoned thus this fellow finds that in
the first instance I guessed odd and in the second he will propose to
himself upon the first impulse a simple variation from even to odd
as did the first simpleton but then a second thought will suggest that
this is too simple a variation and finally he will decide upon putting
it even as before I will therefore guess even he guesses even and
wins now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy whom his fellows
termed lucky what in its last analysis is it

it is merely I said an identification of the reasoners intellect
with that of his opponent

it is said dupin and upon inquiring of the boy by what means he
effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted i
received answer as follows when I wish to find out how wise or how
stupid or how good or how wicked is any one or what are his thoughts
at the moment I fashion the expression of my face as accurately as
possible in accordance with the expression of his and then wait to see
what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart as if to match or
correspond with the expression this response of the schoolboy lies at
the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to
rochefoucault to la bougive to machiavellI and to campanella

and the identification I said of the reasoners intellect with that
of his opponent depends if I understand you aright upon the accuracy
with which the opponents intellect is admeasured

for its practical value it depends upon this replied dupin and the
prefect and his cohort fail so frequently first by default of this
identification and secondly by ill-admeasurement or rather through
non-admeasurement of the intellect with which they are engaged they
consider only their own ideas of ingenuity and in searching for
anything hidden advert only to the modes in which they would have
hidden it they are right in this much that their own ingenuity is a
faithful representative of that of the mass but when the cunning of the
individual felon is diverse in character from their own the felon foils
them of course this always happens when it is above their own and
very usually when it is below they have no variation of principle in
their investigations at best when urged by some unusual emergency by
some extraordinary reward they extend or exaggerate their old modes of
practice without touching their principles what for example in this
case of d  has been done to vary the principle of action what is
all this boring and probing and sounding and scrutinizing with the
microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered
square inches what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of
the one principle or set of principles of search which are based upon
the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity to which the prefect
in the long routine of his duty has been accustomed do you not see he
has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter not
exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg but at least in some
out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought
which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in
a chair-leg and do you not see also that such recherchés nooks for
concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be
adopted only by ordinary intellects for in all cases of concealment
a disposal of the article concealed a disposal of it in this recherché
manner is in the very first instance presumable and presumed and
thus its discovery depends not at all upon the acumen but altogether
upon the mere care patience and determination of the seekers and
where the case is of importance or what amounts to the same thing in
the policial eyes when the reward is of magnitude the qualities in
question have never been known to fail you will now understand what i
meant in suggesting that had the purloined letter been hidden any where
within the limits of the prefects examination in other words had the
principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of
the prefect its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond
question this functionary however has been thoroughly mystified
and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the
minister is a fool because he has acquired renown as a poet all fools
are poets this the prefect feels and he is merely guilty of a non
distributio mediI in thence inferring that all poets are fools

but is this really the poet I asked there are two brothers I know
and both have attained reputation in letters the minister I believe has
written learnedly on the differential calculus he is a mathematician
and no poet

you are mistaken I know him well he is both as poet and
mathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he could
not have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the mercy of the
prefect

you surprise me I said by these opinions which have been
contradicted by the voice of the world you do not mean to set at naught
the well-digested idea of centuries the mathematical reason has long
been regarded as the reason par excellence

il y a à parièr replied dupin quoting from chamfort que toute
idée publique toute convention reçue est une sottise car elle a
convenue au plus grand nombre the mathematicians I grant you have
done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude and
which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth with an
art worthy a better cause for example they have insinuated the term
analysis into application to algebra the french are the originators
of this particular deception but if a term is of any importance if
words derive any value from applicability then analysis conveys
algebra about as much as in latin ambitus implies ambition
religio religion or homines honestI a set of honorablemen

you have a quarrel on hand I see said I with some of the
algebraists of paris but proceed

I dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason which
is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical
I dispute in particular the reason educed by mathematical study the
mathematics are the science of form and quantity mathematical reasoning
is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity the great
error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure
algebra are abstract or general truths and this error is so egregious
that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been
received mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth what is
true of relation of form and quantity is often grossly false in regard
to morals for example in this latter science it is very usually untrue
that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole in chemistry also the
axiom fails in the consideration of motive it fails for two motives
each of a given value have not necessarily a value when united equal
to the sum of their values apart there are numerous other mathematical
truths which are only truths within the limits of relation but the
mathematician argues from his finite truths through habit as if
they were of an absolutely general applicability as the world indeed
imagines them to be bryant in his very learned mythology mentions
an analogous source of error when he says that although the pagan
fables are not believed yet we forget ourselves continually and make
inferences from them as existing realities with the algebraists
however who are pagans themselves the pagan fables are believed and
the inferences are made not so much through lapse of memory as
through an unaccountable addling of the brains in short I never yet
encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal
roots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith
that x+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q say to one of
these gentlemen by way of experiment if you please that you believe
occasions may occur where x+px is not altogether equal to q and
having made him understand what you mean get out of his reach as
speedily as convenient for beyond doubt he will endeavor to knock you
down

I mean to say continued dupin while I merely laughed at his
last observations that if the minister had been no more than a
mathematician the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving
me this check I know him however as both mathematician and poet
and my measures were adapted to his capacity with reference to the
circumstances by which he was surrounded I knew him as a courtier too
and as a bold intriguant such a man I considered could not fail to be
aware of the ordinary policial modes of action he could not have
failed to anticipate and events have proved that he did not fail to
anticipate the waylayings to which he was subjected he must have
foreseen I reflected the secret investigations of his premises his
frequent absences from home at night which were hailed by the prefect
as certain aids to his success I regarded only as ruses to afford
opportunity for thorough search to the police and thus the sooner to
impress them with the conviction to which g  in fact did finally
arrive the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises i
felt also that the whole train of thought which I was at some pains
in detailing to you just now concerning the invariable principle of
policial action in searches for articles concealed I felt that this
whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the
minister it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary
nooks of concealment he could not I reflected be so weak as not to
see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be
as open as his commonest closets to the eyes to the probes to the
gimlets and to the microscopes of the prefect I saw in fine that
he would be driven as a matter of course to simplicity if not
deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice you will remember
perhaps how desperately the prefect laughed when I suggested upon our
first interview that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so
much on account of its being so very self-evident

yes said I I remember his merriment well I really thought he would
have fallen into convulsions

the material world continued dupin abounds with very strict
analogies to the immaterial and thus some color of truth has been
given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may be made
to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description the
principle of the vis inertiæ for example seems to be identical in
physics and metaphysics it is not more true in the former that a large
body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one and that
its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty than it
is in the latter that intellects of the vaster capacity while more
forcible more constant and more eventful in their movements than those
of inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more embarrassed
and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress again
have you ever noticed which of the street signs over the shop-doors
are the most attractive of attention

I have never given the matter a thought I said

there is a game of puzzles he resumed which is played upon a map
one party playing requires another to find a given word the name of
town river state or empire any word in short upon the motley and
perplexed surface of the chart a novice in the game generally seeks to
embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names
but the adept selects such words as stretch in large characters from
one end of the chart to the other these like the over-largely lettered
signs and placards of the street escape observation by dint of being
excessively obvious and here the physical oversight is precisely
analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers
to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too
palpably self-evident but this is a point it appears somewhat above
or beneath the understanding of the prefect he never once thought
it probable or possible that the minister had deposited the letter
immediately beneath the nose of the whole world by way of best
preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it

but the more I reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminating
ingenuity of d  upon the fact that the document must always have been
at hand if he intended to use it to good purpose and upon the decisive
evidence obtained by the prefect that it was not hidden within the
limits of that dignitarys ordinary search the more satisfied i
became that to conceal this letter the minister had resorted to the
comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at
all

full of these ideas I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles
and called one fine morning quite by accident at the ministerial
hotel I found d  at home yawning lounging and dawdling as usual
and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennuI he is perhaps
the most really energetic human being now alive but that is only when
nobody sees him

to be even with him I complained of my weak eyes and lamented the
necessity of the spectacles under cover of which I cautiously and
thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment while seemingly intent only
upon the conversation of my host

I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat
and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other
papers with one or two musical instruments and a few books here
however after a long and very deliberate scrutiny I saw nothing to
excite particular suspicion

at length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon a
trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard that hung dangling by a
dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of
the mantel-piece in this rack which had three or four compartments
were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter this last
was much soiled and crumpled it was torn nearly in two across the
middle as if a design in the first instance to tear it entirely up
as worthless had been altered or stayed in the second it had a
large black seal bearing the d  cipher very conspicuously and was
addressed in a diminutive female hand to d  the minister himself
it was thrust carelessly and even as it seemed contemptuously into
one of the uppermost divisions of the rack

no sooner had I glanced at this letter than I concluded it to be
that of which I was in search to be sure it was to all appearance
radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so
minute a description here the seal was large and black with the d 
cipher there it was small and red with the ducal arms of the s 
family here the address to the minister diminutive and feminine
there the superscription to a certain royal personage was markedly
bold and decided the size alone formed a point of correspondence but
then the radicalness of these differences which was excessive the
dirt the soiled and torn condition of the paper so inconsistent with
the true methodical habits of d  and so suggestive of a design to
delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document
these things together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this
document full in the view of every visiter and thus exactly in
accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived these
things I say were strongly corroborative of suspicion in one who came
with the intention to suspect

I protracted my visit as long as possible and while I maintained a
most animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which I knew
well had never failed to interest and excite him I kept my attention
really riveted upon the letter in this examination I committed to
memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack and also
fell at length upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial
doubt I might have entertained in scrutinizing the edges of the paper
I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary they presented
the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper having
been once folded and pressed with a folder is refolded in a reversed
direction in the same creases or edges which had formed the original
fold this discovery was sufficient it was clear to me that the letter
had been turned as a glove inside out re-directed and re-sealed i
bade the minister good morning and took my departure at once leaving a
gold snuff-box upon the table

the next morning I called for the snuff-box when we resumed quite
eagerly the conversation of the preceding day while thus engaged
however a loud report as if of a pistol was heard immediately beneath
the windows of the hotel and was succeeded by a series of fearful
screams and the shoutings of a terrified mob d  rushed to a casement
threw it open and looked out in the meantime I stepped to the
card-rack took the letter put it in my pocket and replaced it by
a fac-simile so far as regards externals which I had carefully
prepared at my lodgings imitating the d  cipher very readily by
means of a seal formed of bread

the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic
behavior of a man with a musket he had fired it among a crowd of women
and children it proved however to have been without ball and the
fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard when
he had gone d  came from the window whither I had followed him
immediately upon securing the object in view soon afterwards I bade him
farewell the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay

but what purpose had you I asked in replacing the letter by a
fac-simile would it not have been better at the first visit to have
seized it openly and departed

d  replied dupin is a desperate man and a man of nerve his
hotel too is not without attendants devoted to his interests had
I made the wild attempt you suggest I might never have left the
ministerial presence alive the good people of paris might have heard
of me no more but I had an object apart from these considerations you
know my political prepossessions in this matter I act as a partisan of
the lady concerned for eighteen months the minister has had her in his
power she has now him in hers since being unaware that the letter is
not in his possession he will proceed with his exactions as if it
was thus will he inevitably commit himself at once to his political
destruction his downfall too will not be more precipitate than
awkward it is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus averni
but in all kinds of climbing as catalanI said of singing it is far
more easy to get up than to come down in the present instance I have
no sympathy at least no pity for him who descends he is that monstrum
horrendum an unprincipled man of genius I confess however that i
should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts
when being defied by her whom the prefect terms a certain personage
he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the
card-rack

how did you put any thing particular in it

why it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank that
would have been insulting d  at vienna once did me an evil turn
which I told him quite good-humoredly that I should remember so as
I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the
person who had outwitted him I thought it a pity not to give him a
clue he is well acquainted with my ms and I just copied into the
middle of the blank sheet the words

the thousand-and-second tale of scheherazade

                     truth is stranger than fiction

                              old saying

having had occasion lately in the course of some oriental
investigations to consult the tellmenow isitsoornot a work which like
the zohar of simeon jochaides is scarcely known at all even in europe
and which has never been quoted to my knowledge by any american if
we except perhaps the author of the curiosities of american
literature having had occasion I say to turn over some pages of the
first-mentioned very remarkable work I was not a little astonished to
discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error
respecting the fate of the viziers daughter scheherazade as that
fate is depicted in the arabian nights and that the denouement there
given if not altogether inaccurate as far as it goes is at least to
blame in not having gone very much farther

for full information on this interesting topic I must refer the
inquisitive reader to the isitsoornot itself but in the meantime i
shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered

it will be remembered that in the usual version of the tales a
certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen not only
puts her to death but makes a vow by his beard and the prophet to
espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions and the
next morning to deliver her up to the executioner

having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter and with a
religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him
as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense he was interrupted one
afternoon no doubt at his prayers by a visit from his grand vizier to
whose daughter it appears there had occurred an idea

her name was scheherazade and her idea was that she would either
redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty or perish
after the approved fashion of all heroines in the attempt

accordingly and although we do not find it to be leap-year which
makes the sacrifice more meritorious she deputes her father the grand
vizier to make an offer to the king of her hand this hand the king
eagerly accepts he had intended to take it at all events and had put
off the matter from day to day only through fear of the vizier but
in accepting it now he gives all parties very distinctly to understand
that grand vizier or no grand vizier he has not the slightest design
of giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges when therefore
the fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king and did actually
marry him despite her fathers excellent advice not to do any thing of
the kind when she would and did marry him I say will I nill I it
was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of
the case would allow

it seems however that this politic damsel who had been reading
machiavellI beyond doubt had a very ingenious little plot in her
mind on the night of the wedding she contrived upon I forget what
specious pretence to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near
that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed
and a little before cock-crowing she took care to awaken the good
monarch her husband who bore her none the worse will because he
intended to wring her neck on the morrow she managed to awaken him i
say although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion
he slept well by the profound interest of a story about a rat and a
black cat I think which she was narrating all in an undertone of
course to her sister when the day broke it so happened that this
history was not altogether finished and that scheherazade in the
nature of things could not finish it just then since it was high time
for her to get up and be bowstrung a thing very little more pleasant
than hanging only a trifle more genteel

the kings curiosity however prevailing I am sorry to say even over
his sound religious principles induced him for this once to postpone
the fulfilment of his vow until next morning for the purpose and with
the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black
cat a black cat I think it was and the rat

the night having arrived however the lady scheherazade not only put
the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat the rat was blue
but before she well knew what she was about found herself deep in the
intricacies of a narration having reference if I am not altogether
mistaken to a pink horse with green wings that went in a violent
manner by clockwork and was wound up with an indigo key with this
history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the
other and as the day broke before its conclusion notwithstanding
all the queens endeavors to get through with it in time for the
bowstringing there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony
as before for twenty-four hours the next night there happened a
similar accident with a similar result and then the next and then
again the next so that in the end the good monarch having been
unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a
period of no less than one thousand and one nights either forgets it
altogether by the expiration of this time or gets himself absolved of
it in the regular way or what is more probable breaks it outright as
well as the head of his father confessor at all events scheherazade
who being lineally descended from eve fell heir perhaps to the whole
seven baskets of talk which the latter lady we all know picked up
from under the trees in the garden of eden scheherazade I say finally
triumphed and the tariff upon beauty was repealed

now this conclusion which is that of the story as we have it upon
record is no doubt excessively proper and pleasant but alas like
a great many pleasant things is more pleasant than true and I am
indebted altogether to the isitsoornot for the means of correcting the
error le mieux says a french proverb est lennemI du bien and
in mentioning that scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk
I should have added that she put them out at compound interest until
they amounted to seventy-seven

my dear sister said she on the thousand-and-second night I quote
the language of the isitsoornot at this point verbatim my dear
sister said she now that all this little difficulty about the
bowstring has blown over and that this odious tax is so happily
repealed I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion in
withholding from you and the king who I am sorry to say snores a
thing no gentleman would do the full conclusion of sinbad the sailor
this person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures
than those which I related but the truth is I felt sleepy on the
particular night of their narration and so was seduced into cutting
them short a grievous piece of misconduct for which I only trust that
allah will forgive me but even yet it is not too late to remedy my
great neglect and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in
order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise
I will forthwith entertain you and him if he pleases with the sequel
of this very remarkable story

hereupon the sister of scheherazade as I have it from the
isitsoornot expressed no very particular intensity of gratification
but the king having been sufficiently pinched at length ceased
snoring and finally said hum and then hoo when the queen
understanding these words which are no doubt arabic to signify that
he was all attention and would do his best not to snore any more the
queen I say having arranged these matters to her satisfaction
re-entered thus at once into the history of sinbad the sailor

at length in my old age these are the words of sinbad himself as
retailed by scheherazade at length in my old age and after enjoying
many years of tranquillity at home I became once more possessed of a
desire of visiting foreign countries and one day without acquainting
any of my family with my design I packed up some bundles of such
merchandise as was most precious and least bulky and engaged a porter
to carry them went with him down to the sea-shore to await the arrival
of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some
region which I had not as yet explored

having deposited the packages upon the sands we sat down beneath some
trees and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship
but during several hours we saw none whatever at length I fancied that
I could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound and the porter after
listening awhile declared that he also could distinguish it presently
it grew louder and then still louder so that we could have no doubt
that the object which caused it was approaching us at length on
the edge of the horizon we discovered a black speck which rapidly
increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster swimming
with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea it came
toward us with inconceivable swiftness throwing up huge waves of foam
around its breast and illuminating all that part of the sea through
which it passed with a long line of fire that extended far off into the
distance

as the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly its length was equal
to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow and it was as wide as
the great hall of audience in your palace o most sublime and munificent
of the caliphs its body which was unlike that of ordinary fishes was
as solid as a rock and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion
of it which floated above the water with the exception of a narrow
blood-red streak that completely begirdled it the belly which floated
beneath the surface and of which we could get only a glimpse now and
then as the monster rose and fell with the billows was entirely covered
with metallic scales of a color like that of the moon in misty weather
the back was flat and nearly white and from it there extended upwards
of six spines about half the length of the whole body

the horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive but as if
to make up for this deficiency it was provided with at least four
score of eyes that protruded from their sockets like those of the green
dragon-fly and were arranged all around the body in two rows one above
the other and parallel to the blood-red streak which seemed to answer
the purpose of an eyebrow two or three of these dreadful eyes were much
larger than the others and had the appearance of solid gold

although this beast approached us as I have before said with the
greatest rapidity it must have been moved altogether by necromancy for
it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck nor wings like
the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel nor yet
did it writhe itself forward as do the eels its head and its tail were
shaped precisely alike only not far from the latter were two small
holes that served for nostrils and through which the monster puffed
out its thick breath with prodigious violence and with a shrieking
disagreeable noise

our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great but it was
even surpassed by our astonishment when upon getting a nearer look we
perceived upon the creatures back a vast number of animals about the
size and shape of men and altogether much resembling them except that
they wore no garments as men do being supplied by nature no doubt
with an ugly uncomfortable covering a good deal like cloth but fitting
so tight to the skin as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward
and put them apparently to severe pain on the very tips of their heads
were certain square-looking boxes which at first sight I thought
might have been intended to answer as turbans but I soon discovered
that they were excessively heavy and solid and I therefore concluded
they were contrivances designed by their great weight to keep the
heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders around
the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars badges of
servitude no doubt such as we keep on our dogs only much wider
and infinitely stiffer so that it was quite impossible for these poor
victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at
the same time and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of
their noses a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful if not positively
in an awful degree

when the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood it
suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent and emitted from
it a terrible flash of fire accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke and
a noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder as the smoke cleared
away we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of the
large beast with a trumpet in his hand through which putting it to
his mouth he presently addressed us in loud harsh and disagreeable
accents that perhaps we should have mistaken for language had they
not come altogether through the nose

being thus evidently spoken to I was at a loss how to reply as i
could in no manner understand what was said and in this difficulty
I turned to the porter who was near swooning through affright and
demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was what
it wanted and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed
upon its back to this the porter replied as well as he could for
trepidation that he had once before heard of this sea-beast that it
was a cruel demon with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire created
by evil geniI as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind that the
things upon its back were vermin such as sometimes infest cats and
dogs only a little larger and more savage and that these vermin had
their uses however evil for through the torture they caused the beast
by their nibbling and stingings it was goaded into that degree of wrath
which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill and so fulfil the
vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii

this account determined me to take to my heels and without once even
looking behind me I ran at full speed up into the hills while the
porter ran equally fast although nearly in an opposite direction so
that by these means he finally made his escape with my bundles of
which I have no doubt he took excellent care although this is a point i
cannot determine as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again

for myself I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin who
had come to the shore in boats that I was very soon overtaken bound
hand and foot and conveyed to the beast which immediately swam out
again into the middle of the sea

I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to
peril my life in such adventures as this but regret being useless i
made the best of my condition and exerted myself to secure the goodwill
of the man-animal that owned the trumpet and who appeared to exercise
authority over his fellows I succeeded so well in this endeavor that
in a few days the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his
favor and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the
rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language so
that at length I was enabled to converse with it readily and came to
make it comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world

washish squashish squeak sinbad hey-diddle diddle grunt unt
grumble hiss fiss whiss said he to me one day after dinner but
I beg a thousand pardons I had forgotten that your majesty is not
conversant with the dialect of the cock-neighs so the man-animals were
called I presume because their language formed the connecting
link between that of the horse and that of the rooster with your
permission I will translate washish squashish and so forth that
is to say I am happy to find my dear sinbad that you are really a
very excellent fellow we are now about doing a thing which is called
circumnavigating the globe and since you are so desirous of seeing the
world I will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of
the beast

when the lady scheherazade had proceeded thus far relates the
isitsoornot the king turned over from his left side to his right and
said

it is in fact very surprising my dear queen that you omitted
hitherto these latter adventures of sinbad do you know I think them
exceedingly entertaining and strange

the king having thus expressed himself we are told the fair
scheherazade resumed her history in the following words

sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative to the caliph i
thanked the man-animal for its kindness and soon found myself very much
at home on the beast which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean
although the surface of the latter is in that part of the world by
no means flat but round like a pomegranate so that we went so to
say either up hill or down hill all the time

that I think was very singular interrupted the king

nevertheless it is quite true replied scheherazade

I have my doubts rejoined the king but pray be so good as to go
on with the story

I will said the queen the beast continued sinbad to the caliph
swam as I have related up hill and down hill until at length we
arrived at an island many hundreds of miles in circumference but
which nevertheless had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony
of little things like caterpillars 

hum said the king

leaving this island said sinbad for scheherazade it must be
understood took no notice of her husbands ill-mannered ejaculation
leaving this island we came to another where the forests were of solid
stone and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest-tempered axes
with which we endeavoured to cut them down 

hum said the king again but scheherazade paying him no attention
continued in the language of sinbad

passing beyond this last island we reached a country where there
was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the
bowels of the earth and that contained a greater number of far more
spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all
damascus and bagdad from the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads
of gems like diamonds but larger than men and in among the streets
of towers and pyramids and temples there flowed immense rivers as black
as ebony and swarming with fish that had no eyes 

hum said the king we then swam into a region of the sea where
we found a lofty mountain down whose sides there streamed torrents of
melted metal some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long
 while from an abyss on the summit issued so vast a quantity of
ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens and it
became darker than the darkest midnight so that when we were even at
the distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain it was
impossible to see the whitest object however close we held it to our
eyes 

hum said the king

after quitting this coast the beast continued his voyage until we met
with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed for we here
saw a great lake at the bottom of which more than a hundred feet
beneath the surface of the water there flourished in full leaf a forest
of tall and luxuriant trees 

hoo said the king

some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the
atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel just as our own
does feather 

fiddle de dee said the king

proceeding still in the same direction we presently arrived at the
most magnificent region in the whole world through it there meandered
a glorious river for several thousands of miles this river was of
unspeakable depth and of a transparency richer than that of amber
it was from three to six miles in width and its banks which arose on
either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height were crowned
with ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers that
made the whole territory one gorgeous garden but the name of this
luxuriant land was the kingdom of horror and to enter it was inevitable
death 

humph said the king

we left this kingdom in great haste and after some days came to
another where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous
animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads these hideous
beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil of a funnel shape
and line the sides of them with rocks so disposed one upon the other
that they fall instantly when trodden upon by other animals thus
precipitating them into the monsters dens where their blood is
immediately sucked and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously
out to an immense distance from the caverns of death 

pooh said the king

continuing our progress we perceived a district with vegetables that
grew not upon any soil but in the air  there were others that
sprang from the substance of other vegetables  others that derived
their substance from the bodies of living animals  and then again
there were others that glowed all over with intense fire  others
that moved from place to place at pleasure  and what was still
more wonderful we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved
their limbs at will and had moreover the detestable passion of mankind
for enslaving other creatures and confining them in horrid and solitary
prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks 

pshaw said the king

quitting this land we soon arrived at another in which the bees and
the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition that they
give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men
of the empire the king of the place having offered a reward for the
solution of two very difficult problems they were solved upon the
spot the one by the bees and the other by the birds but the king
keeping their solution a secret it was only after the most profound
researches and labor and the writing of an infinity of big books
during a long series of years that the men-mathematicians at length
arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by
the bees and by the birds 

oh my said the king

we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves
close upon another from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock
of fowls a mile in breadth and two hundred and forty miles long so
that although they flew a mile during every minute it required no less
than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us in which there were
several millions of millions of fowl 

oh fy said the king

no sooner had we got rid of these birds which occasioned us great
annoyance than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another
kind and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in my
former voyages for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your
seraglio oh most munificent of caliphs this terrible fowl had no head
that we could perceive but was fashioned entirely of belly which was
of a prodigious fatness and roundness of a soft-looking substance
smooth shining and striped with various colors in its talons the
monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens a house from which
it had knocked off the roof and in the interior of which we distinctly
saw human beings who beyond doubt were in a state of frightful
despair at the horrible fate which awaited them we shouted with all our
might in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey
but it merely gave a snort or puff as if of rage and then let fall upon
our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand

stuff said the king

it was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of
immense extent and prodigious solidity but which nevertheless was
supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer
than four hundred horns 

that now I believe said the king because I have read something of
the kind before in a book

we passed immediately beneath this continent swimming in between the
legs of the cow and after some hours found ourselves in a wonderful
country indeed which I was informed by the man-animal was his own
native land inhabited by things of his own species this elevated the
man-animal very much in my esteem and in fact I now began to feel
ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him
for I found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most
powerful magicians who lived with worms in their brain  which
no doubt served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and
wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of imagination

nonsense said the king

among the magicians were domesticated several animals of very
singular kinds for example there was a huge horse whose bones were
iron and whose blood was boiling water in place of corn he had black
stones for his usual food and yet in spite of so hard a diet he was
so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the
grandest temple in this city at a rate surpassing that of the flight of
most birds 

twattle said the king

I saw also among these people a hen without feathers but bigger
than a camel instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick her
blood like that of the horse to whom in fact she was nearly
related was boiling water and like him she ate nothing but wood or
black stones this hen brought forth very frequently a hundred chickens
in the day and after birth they took up their residence for several
weeks within the stomach of their mother 

fa lal said the king

one of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and
wood and leather and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would
have beaten at chess all the race of mankind with the exception of the
great caliph haroun alraschid  another of these magI constructed
of like material a creature that put to shame even the genius of him
who made it for so great were its reasoning powers that in a second
it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have
required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year 
but a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing
that was neither man nor beast but which had brains of lead intermixed
with a black matter like pitch and fingers that it employed with such
incredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in
writing out twenty thousand copies of the koran in an hour and this
with so exquisite a precision that in all the copies there should not
be found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair
this thing was of prodigious strength so that it erected or overthrew
the mightiest empires at a breath but its powers were exercised equally
for evil and for good

ridiculous said the king

among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his
veins the blood of the salamanders for he made no scruple of sitting
down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner was
thoroughly roasted upon its floor  another had the faculty of
converting the common metals into gold without even looking at them
during the process  another had such a delicacy of touch that he
made a wire so fine as to be invisible  another had such quickness
of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic
body while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine
hundred millions of times in a second 

absurd said the king

another of these magicians by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet
saw could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms kick out
their legs fight or even get up and dance at his will  another
had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made
himself heard from one end of the world to the other  another had
so long an arm that he could sit down in damascus and indite a letter
at bagdad or indeed at any distance whatsoever  another commanded
the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens and it came at his
call and served him for a plaything when it came another took two
loud sounds and out of them made a silence another constructed a
deep darkness out of two brilliant lights  another made ice in a
red-hot furnace  another directed the sun to paint his portrait
and the sun did  another took this luminary with the moon and the
planets and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy probed
into their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which
they were made but the whole nation is indeed of so surprising a
necromantic ability that not even their infants nor their commonest
cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at
all or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation
itself had been blotted out from the face of creation 

preposterous said the king

the wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi
continued scheherazade without being in any manner disturbed by
these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her
husband the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every
thing that is accomplished and refined and would be every thing that is
interesting and beautiful but for an unhappy fatality that besets them
and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and
fathers has hitherto been adequate to save some fatalities come in
certain shapes and some in others but this of which I speak has come
in the shape of a crotchet

a what said the king

a crotchet said scheherazade one of the evil geniI who are
perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill has put it into the heads of
these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal
beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies
not very far below the small of the back perfection of loveliness they
say is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump having been long
possessed of this idea and bolsters being cheap in that country the
days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from
a dromedary-

stop said the king I cant stand that and I wont you have
already given me a dreadful headache with your lies the day too i
perceive is beginning to break how long have we been married my
conscience is getting to be troublesome again and then that dromedary
touch do you take me for a fool upon the whole you might as well get
up and be throttled

these words as I learn from the isitsoornot both grieved and
astonished scheherazade but as she knew the king to be a man of
scrupulous integrity and quite unlikely to forfeit his word she
submitted to her fate with a good grace she derived however great
consolation during the tightening of the bowstring from the
reflection that much of the history remained still untold and that the
petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous
reward in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures




a descent into the maelstrÖm

  joseph glanville

we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag for some minutes the
old man seemed too much exhausted to speak

not long ago said he at length and I could have guided you on this
route as well as the youngest of my sons but about three years past
there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man or
at least such as no man ever survived to tell of and the six hours of
deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul you
suppose me a very old man but I am not it took less than a single
day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white to weaken
my limbs and to unstring my nerves so that I tremble at the least
exertion and am frightened at a shadow do you know I can scarcely look
over this little cliff without getting giddy

the little cliff upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself
down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it while
he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme
and slippery edge this little cliff arose a sheer unobstructed
precipice of black shining rock some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet
from the world of crags beneath us nothing would have tempted me to
within half a dozen yards of its brink in truth so deeply was I excited
by the perilous position of my companion that I fell at full length
upon the ground clung to the shrubs around me and dared not even
glance upward at the sky while I struggled in vain to divest myself of
the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from
the fury of the winds it was long before I could reason myself into
sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance

you must get over these fancies said the guide for I have brought
you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that
event I mentioned and to tell you the whole story with the spot just
under your eye

we are now he continued in that particularizing manner which
distinguished him we are now close upon the norwegian coast in the
sixty-eighth degree of latitude in the great province of nordland and
in the dreary district of lofoden the mountain upon whose top we sit is
helseggen the cloudy now raise yourself up a little higher hold on to
the grass if you feel giddy so and look out beyond the belt of vapor
beneath us into the sea

I looked dizzily and beheld a wide expanse of ocean whose waters wore
so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the nubian geographers
account of the mare tenebrarum a panorama more deplorably desolate no
human imagination can conceive to the right and left as far as the eye
could reach there lay outstretched like ramparts of the world lines
of horridly black and beetling cliff whose character of gloom was but
the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against
its white and ghastly crest howling and shrieking forever just
opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed and at a
distance of some five or six miles out at sea there was visible
a small bleak-looking island or more properly its position was
discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped
about two miles nearer the land arose another of smaller size
hideously craggy and barren and encompassed at various intervals by a
cluster of dark rocks

the appearance of the ocean in the space between the more distant
island and the shore had something very unusual about it although
at the time so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the
remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail and constantly
plunged her whole hull out of sight still there was here nothing like a
regular swell but only a short quick angry cross dashing of water in
every direction as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise of foam
there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks

the island in the distance resumed the old man is called by
the norwegians vurrgh the one midway is moskoe that a mile to the
northward is ambaaren yonder are islesen hotholm keildhelm suarven
and buckholm farther off between moskoe and vurrgh are otterholm
flimen sandflesen and stockholm these are the true names of the
places but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all is
more than either you or I can understand do you hear anything do you
see any change in the water

we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of helseggen to which
we had ascended from the interior of lofoden so that we had caught no
glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit as the
old man spoke I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound
like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american prairie
and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping
character of the ocean beneath us was rapidly changing into a current
which set to the eastward even while I gazed this current acquired
a monstrous velocity each moment added to its speed to its headlong
impetuosity in five minutes the whole sea as far as vurrgh was lashed
into ungovernable fury but it was between moskoe and the coast that the
main uproar held its sway here the vast bed of the waters seamed
and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels burst suddenly into
phrensied convulsion heaving boiling hissing gyrating in gigantic
and innumerable vortices and all whirling and plunging on to the
eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in
precipitous descents

in a few minutes more there came over the scene another radical
alteration the general surface grew somewhat more smooth and the
whirlpools one by one disappeared while prodigious streaks of foam
became apparent where none had been seen before these streaks
at length spreading out to a great distance and entering into
combination took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the
subsided vortices and seemed to form the germ of another more vast
suddenly very suddenly this assumed a distinct and definite existence
in a circle of more than a mile in diameter the edge of the whirl was
represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray but no particle of this
slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel whose interior as far
as the eye could fathom it was a smooth shining and jet-black wall of
water inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees
speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion
and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice half shriek half
roar such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up in
its agony to heaven

the mountain trembled to its very base and the rock rocked I threw
myself upon my face and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of
nervous agitation

this said I at length to the old man this can be nothing else
than the great whirlpool of the maelström

so it is sometimes termed said he we norwegians call it the
moskoe-ström from the island of moskoe in the midway

the ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me
for what I saw that of jonas ramus which is perhaps the most
circumstantial of any cannot impart the faintest conception either
of the magnificence or of the horror of the scene or of the wild
bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder I am not
sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it nor at
what time but it could neither have been from the summit of helseggen
nor during a storm there are some passages of his description
nevertheless which may be quoted for their details although their
effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the
spectacle

between lofoden and moskoe he says the depth of the water is
between thirty-six and forty fathoms but on the other side toward ver
vurrgh this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage
for a vessel without the risk of splitting on the rocks which happens
even in the calmest weather when it is flood the stream runs up the
country between lofoden and moskoe with a boisterous rapidity but the
roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest
and most dreadful cataracts the noise being heard several leagues off
and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth that if a ship
comes within its attraction it is inevitably absorbed and carried down
to the bottom and there beat to pieces against the rocks and when
the water relaxes the fragments thereof are thrown up again but these
intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood
and in calm weather and last but a quarter of an hour its violence
gradually returning when the stream is most boisterous and its fury
heightened by a storm it is dangerous to come within a norway mile
of it boats yachts and ships have been carried away by not guarding
against it before they were within its reach it likewise happens
frequently that whales come too near the stream and are overpowered by
its violence and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and
bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves a
bear once attempting to swim from lofoden to moskoe was caught by the
stream and borne down while he roared terribly so as to be heard on
shore large stocks of firs and pine trees after being absorbed by the
current rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew
upon them this plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks
among which they are whirled to and fro this stream is regulated by the
flux and reflux of the sea it being constantly high and low water every
six hours in the year  early in the morning of sexagesima sunday
it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the
houses on the coast fell to the ground

in regard to the depth of the water I could not see how this could have
been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex the
forty fathoms must have reference only to portions of the channel
close upon the shore either of moskoe or lofoden the depth in the
centre of the moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater and no better
proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the
sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the
highest crag of helseggen looking down from this pinnacle upon the
howling phlegethon below I could not help smiling at the simplicity
with which the honest jonas ramus records as a matter difficult of
belief the anecdotes of the whales and the bears for it appeared to
me in fact a self-evident thing that the largest ship of the line in
existence coming within the influence of that deadly attraction could
resist it as little as a feather the hurricane and must disappear
bodily and at once

the attempts to account for the phenomenon some of which I remember
seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal now wore a very
different and unsatisfactory aspect the idea generally received is that
this as well as three smaller vortices among the ferroe islands have
no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling at flux
and reflux against a ridge of rocks and shelves which confines the
water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract and thus the
higher the flood rises the deeper must the fall be and the natural
result of all is a whirlpool or vortex the prodigious suction of which
is sufficiently known by lesser experiments these are the words of
the encyclopædia britannica kircher and others imagine that in the
centre of the channel of the maelström is an abyss penetrating the
globe and issuing in some very remote part the gulf of bothnia being
somewhat decidedly named in one instance this opinion idle in itself
was the one to which as I gazed my imagination most readily assented
and mentioning it to the guide I was rather surprised to hear him say
that although it was the view almost universally entertained of the
subject by the norwegians it nevertheless was not his own as to the
former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it and here i
agreed with him for however conclusive on paper it becomes altogether
unintelligible and even absurd amid the thunder of the abyss

you have had a good look at the whirl now said the old man and if
you will creep round this crag so as to get in its lee and deaden
the roar of the water I will tell you a story that will convince you i
ought to know something of the moskoe-ström

I placed myself as desired and he proceeded

myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about
seventy tons burthen with which we were in the habit of fishing among
the islands beyond moskoe nearly to vurrgh in all violent eddies at
sea there is good fishing at proper opportunities if one has only the
courage to attempt it but among the whole of the lofoden coastmen we
three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the
islands as I tell you the usual grounds are a great way lower down to
the southward there fish can be got at all hours without much risk
and therefore these places are preferred the choice spots over here
among the rocks however not only yield the finest variety but in far
greater abundance so that we often got in a single day what the more
timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week in fact we made
it a matter of desperate speculation the risk of life standing instead
of labor and courage answering for capital

we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than
this and it was our practice in fine weather to take advantage of
the fifteen minutes slack to push across the main channel of the
moskoe-ström far above the pool and then drop down upon anchorage
somewhere near otterholm or sandflesen where the eddies are not so
violent as elsewhere here we used to remain until nearly time for
slack-water again when we weighed and made for home we never set
out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and
coming one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return and
we seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point twice during six
years we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead
calm which is a rare thing indeed just about here and once we had to
remain on the grounds nearly a week starving to death owing to a
gale which blew up shortly after our arrival and made the channel too
boisterous to be thought of upon this occasion we should have been
driven out to sea in spite of everything for the whirlpools threw us
round and round so violently that at length we fouled our anchor
and dragged it if it had not been that we drifted into one of the
innumerable cross currents here to-day and gone to-morrow which drove
us under the lee of flimen where by good luck we brought up

I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we
encountered on the grounds it is a bad spot to be in even in
good weather but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the
moskoe-ström itself without accident although at times my heart has
been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before
the slack the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at
starting and then we made rather less way than we could wish while
the current rendered the smack unmanageable my eldest brother had a son
eighteen years old and I had two stout boys of my own these would have
been of great assistance at such times in using the sweeps as well as
afterward in fishing but somehow although we ran the risk ourselves
we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger for
after all is said and done it was a horrible danger and that is the
truth

it is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to
tell you occurred it was on the tenth day of july - a day which the
people of this part of the world will never forget for it was one
in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of
the heavens and yet all the morning and indeed until late in the
afternoon there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west
while the sun shone brightly so that the oldest seaman among us could
not have foreseen what was to follow

the three of us my two brothers and myself had crossed over to the
islands about two oclock p m and had soon nearly loaded the smack
with fine fish which we all remarked were more plenty that day
than we had ever known them it was just seven by my watch when we
weighed and started for home so as to make the worst of the ström at
slack water which we knew would be at eight

we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for some
time spanked along at a great rate never dreaming of danger for indeed
we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it all at once we
were taken aback by a breeze from over helseggen this was most
unusual something that had never happened to us before and I began to
feel a little uneasy without exactly knowing why we put the boat on
the wind but could make no headway at all for the eddies and I was
upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage when looking
astern we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored
cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity

in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away and we
were dead becalmed drifting about in every direction this state of
things however did not last long enough to give us time to think about
it in less than a minute the storm was upon us in less than two the
sky was entirely overcast and what with this and the driving spray it
became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack

such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing the
oldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it we had let
our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us but at the first
puff both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed
off the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother who had lashed
himself to it for safety

our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water
it had a complete flush deck with only a small hatch near the bow and
this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to
cross the ström by way of precaution against the chopping seas but for
this circumstance we should have foundered at once for we lay entirely
buried for some moments how my elder brother escaped destruction i
cannot say for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining for my part
as soon as I had let the foresail run I threw myself flat on deck
with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow and with my hands
grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast it was mere
instinct that prompted me to do this which was undoubtedly the very
best thing I could have done for I was too much flurried to think

for some moments we were completely deluged as I say and all this
time I held my breath and clung to the bolt when I could stand it no
longer I raised myself upon my knees still keeping hold with my hands
and thus got my head clear presently our little boat gave herself
a shake just as a dog does in coming out of the water and thus rid
herself in some measure of the seas I was now trying to get the
better of the stupor that had come over me and to collect my senses so
as to see what was to be done when I felt somebody grasp my arm it was
my elder brother and my heart leaped for joy for I had made sure
that he was overboard but the next moment all this joy was turned into
horror for he put his mouth close to my ear and screamed out the word
moskoe-ström

no one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment I shook
from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague i
knew what he meant by that one word well enough I knew what he wished
to make me understand with the wind that now drove us on we were bound
for the whirl of the ström and nothing could save us

you perceive that in crossing the ström channel we always went a
long way up above the whirl even in the calmest weather and then had
to wait and watch carefully for the slack but now we were driving right
upon the pool itself and in such a hurricane as this to be sure i
thought we shall get there just about the slack there is some little
hope in that but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great
a fool as to dream of hope at all I knew very well that we were doomed
had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship

by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself or perhaps
we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it but at all events
the seas which at first had been kept down by the wind and lay flat
and frothing now got up into absolute mountains a singular change
too had come over the heavens around in every direction it was still
as black as pitch but nearly overhead there burst out all at once a
circular rift of clear sky as clear as I ever saw and of a deep bright
blue and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that
I never before knew her to wear she lit up every thing about us with
the greatest distinctness but oh god what a scene it was to light up

I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother but in some
manner which I could not understand the din had so increased that i
could not make him hear a single word although I screamed at the top
of my voice in his ear presently he shook his head looking as pale as
death and held up one of his fingers as if to say listen 

at first I could not make out what he meant but soon a hideous thought
flashed upon me I dragged my watch from its fob it was not going i
glanced at its face by the moonlight and then burst into tears as i
flung it far away into the ocean it had run down at seven oclock
we were behind the time of the slack and the whirl of the ström was in
full fury

when a boat is well built properly trimmed and not deep laden the
waves in a strong gale when she is going large seem always to slip
from beneath her which appears very strange to a landsman and this is
what is called riding in sea phrase well so far we had ridden the
swells very cleverly but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us
right under the counter and bore us with it as it rose up up as
if into the sky I would not have believed that any wave could rise so
high and then down we came with a sweep a slide and a plunge
that made me feel sick and dizzy as if I was falling from some lofty
mountain-top in a dream but while we were up I had thrown a quick
glance around and that one glance was all sufficient I saw our exact
position in an instant the moskoe-ström whirlpool was about a quarter
of a mile dead ahead but no more like the every-day moskoe-ström than
the whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race if I had not known
where we were and what we had to expect I should not have recognised
the place at all as it was I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror
the lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm

it could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we
suddenly felt the waves subside and were enveloped in foam the
boat made a sharp half turn to larboard and then shot off in its new
direction like a thunderbolt at the same moment the roaring noise of
the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek such a
sound as you might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand
steam-vessels letting off their steam all together we were now in the
belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl and I thought of course
that another moment would plunge us into the abyss down which we could
only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we
wore borne along the boat did not seem to sink into the water at
all but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge her
starboard side was next the whirl and on the larboard arose the world
of ocean we had left it stood like a huge writhing wall between us and
the horizon

it may appear strange but now when we were in the very jaws of the
gulf I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it having
made up my mind to hope no more I got rid of a great deal of that
terror which unmanned me at first I suppose it was despair that strung
my nerves

it may look like boasting but what I tell you is truth I began to
reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner and how
foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own
individual life in view of so wonderful a manifestation of gods power
I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind
after a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about
the whirl itself I positively felt a wish to explore its depths even
at the sacrifice I was going to make and my principal grief was that
I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the
mysteries I should see these no doubt were singular fancies to occupy
a mans mind in such extremity and I have often thought since that the
revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little
light-headed

there was another circumstance which tended to restore my
self-possession and this was the cessation of the wind which could not
reach us in our present situation for as you saw yourself the belt of
surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean and this
latter now towered above us a high black mountainous ridge if you
have never been at sea in a heavy gale you can form no idea of the
confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together they
blind deafen and strangle you and take away all power of action
or reflection but we were now in a great measure rid of these
annoyances just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty
indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain

how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say
we careered round and round for perhaps an hour flying rather than
floating getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge
and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge all this time i
had never let go of the ring-bolt my brother was at the stern holding
on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the
coop of the counter and was the only thing on deck that had not been
swept overboard when the gale first took us as we approached the brink
of the pit he let go his hold upon this and made for the ring from
which in the agony of his terror he endeavored to force my hands as
it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp I never felt
deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act although I knew he
was a madman when he did it a raving maniac through sheer fright I did
not care however to contest the point with him I knew it could make
no difference whether either of us held on at all so I let him have the
bolt and went astern to the cask this there was no great difficulty
in doing for the smack flew round steadily enough and upon an even
keel only swaying to and fro with the immense sweeps and swelters of
the whirl scarcely had I secured myself in my new position when we
gave a wild lurch to starboard and rushed headlong into the abyss i
muttered a hurried prayer to god and thought all was over

as I felt the sickening sweep of the descent I had instinctively
tightened my hold upon the barrel and closed my eyes for some seconds
I dared not open them while I expected instant destruction and
wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water
but moment after moment elapsed I still lived the sense of falling had
ceased and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before
while in the belt of foam with the exception that she now lay more
along I took courage and looked once again upon the scene

never shall I forget the sensations of awe horror and admiration with
which I gazed about me the boat appeared to be hanging as if by
magic midway down upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in
circumference prodigious in depth and whose perfectly smooth sides
might have been mistaken for ebony but for the bewildering rapidity
with which they spun around and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance
they shot forth as the rays of the full moon from that circular rift
amid the clouds which I have already described streamed in a flood of
golden glory along the black walls and far away down into the inmost
recesses of the abyss

at first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately
the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld when i
recovered myself a little however my gaze fell instinctively downward
in this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view from the
manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool she
was quite upon an even keel that is to say her deck lay in a plane
parallel with that of the water but this latter sloped at an angle of
more than forty-five degrees so that we seemed to be lying upon our
beam-ends I could not help observing nevertheless that I had scarcely
more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation
than if we had been upon a dead level and this I suppose was owing to
the speed at which we revolved

the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound
gulf but still I could make out nothing distinctly on account of a
thick mist in which everything there was enveloped and over which there
hung a magnificent rainbow like that narrow and tottering bridge which
mussulmen say is the only pathway between time and eternity this mist
or spray was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of
the funnel as they all met together at the bottom but the yell that
went up to the heavens from out of that mist I dare not attempt to
describe

our first slide into the abyss itself from the belt of foam above had
carried us a great distance down the slope but our farther descent
was by no means proportionate round and round we swept not with
any uniform movement but in dizzying swings and jerks that sent
us sometimes only a few hundred yards sometimes nearly the complete
circuit of the whirl our progress downward at each revolution was
slow but very perceptible

looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were
thus borne I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the
embrace of the whirl both above and below us were visible fragments of
vessels large masses of building timber and trunks of trees with
many smaller articles such as pieces of house furniture broken boxes
barrels and staves I have already described the unnatural curiosity
which had taken the place of my original terrors it appeared to grow
upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom I now began to
watch with a strange interest the numerous things that floated in our
company I must have been delirious for I even sought amusement
in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents
toward the foam below this fir tree I found myself at one time
saying will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge
and disappears and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of
a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before at length after
making several guesses of this nature and being deceived in all this
fact the fact of my invariable miscalculation set me upon a train of
reflection that made my limbs again tremble and my heart beat heavily
once more

it was not a new terror that thus affected me but the dawn of a more
exciting hope this hope arose partly from memory and partly from
present observation I called to mind the great variety of buoyant
matter that strewed the coast of lofoden having been absorbed and
then thrown forth by the moskoe-ström by far the greater number of the
articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way so chafed
and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of
splinters but then I distinctly recollected that there were some of
them which were not disfigured at all now I could not account for this
difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the
only ones which had been completely absorbed that the others had
entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide or for some reason
had descended so slowly after entering that they did not reach the
bottom before the turn of the flood came or of the ebb as the case
might be I conceived it possible in either instance that they might
thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean without undergoing
the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or absorbed more
rapidly I made also three important observations the first was
that as a general rule the larger the bodies were the more rapid
their descent the second that between two masses of equal extent the
one spherical and the other of any other shape the superiority
in speed of descent was with the sphere the third that between two
masses of equal size the one cylindrical and the other of any other
shape the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly since my escape i
have had several conversations on this subject with an old school-master
of the district and it was from him that I learned the use of the words
cylinder and sphere he explained to me although I have forgotten
the explanation how what I observed was in fact the natural
consequence of the forms of the floating fragments and showed me how it
happened that a cylinder swimming in a vortex offered more resistance
to its suction and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally
bulky body of any form whatever 

there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in
enforcing these observations and rendering me anxious to turn them to
account and this was that at every revolution we passed something
like a barrel or else the yard or the mast of a vessel while many of
these things which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes
upon the wonders of the whirlpool were now high up above us and seemed
to have moved but little from their original station

I no longer hesitated what to do I resolved to lash myself securely to
the water cask upon which I now held to cut it loose from the counter
and to throw myself with it into the water I attracted my brothers
attention by signs pointed to the floating barrels that came near us
and did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about
to do I thought at length that he comprehended my design but whether
this was the case or not he shook his head despairingly and refused to
move from his station by the ring-bolt it was impossible to reach him
the emergency admitted of no delay and so with a bitter struggle i
resigned him to his fate fastened myself to the cask by means of the
lashings which secured it to the counter and precipitated myself with
it into the sea without another moments hesitation

the result was precisely what I had hoped it might be as it is myself
who now tell you this tale as you see that I did escape and as you
are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected
and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say I will
bring my story quickly to conclusion it might have been an hour or
thereabout after my quitting the smack when having descended to a
vast distance beneath me it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid
succession and bearing my loved brother with it plunged headlong at
once and forever into the chaos of foam below the barrel to which i
was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the
bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard before a
great change took place in the character of the whirlpool the slope of
the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep
the gyrations of the whirl grew gradually less and less violent by
degrees the froth and the rainbow disappeared and the bottom of the
gulf seemed slowly to uprise the sky was clear the winds had gone
down and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west when i
found myself on the surface of the ocean in full view of the shores
of lofoden and above the spot where the pool of the moskoe-ström
had been it was the hour of the slack but the sea still heaved
in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane I was borne
violently into the channel of the ström and in a few minutes was
hurried down the coast into the grounds of the fishermen a boat
picked me up exhausted from fatigue and now that the danger was
removed speechless from the memory of its horror those who drew me on
board were my old mates and daily companions but they knew me no more
than they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land my hair
which had been raven-black the day before was as white as you see
it now they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had
changed I told them my story they did not believe it I now tell it
to you and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did
the merry fishermen of lofoden




von kempelen and his discovery

after the very minute and elaborate paper by arago to say nothing of
the summary in sillimans journal with the detailed statement just
published by lieutenant maury it will not be supposed of course
that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to von kempelens
discovery I have any design to look at the subject in a scientific
point of view my object is simply in the first place to say a few
words of von kempelen himself with whom some years ago I had the
honor of a slight personal acquaintance since every thing which
concerns him must necessarily at this moment be of interest and in
the second place to look in a general way and speculatively at the
results of the discovery

it may be as well however to premise the cursory observations which
I have to offer by denying very decidedly what seems to be a
general impression gleaned as usual in a case of this kind from the
newspapers viz that this discovery astounding as it unquestionably
is is unanticipated

by reference to the diary of sir humphrey davy cottle and munroe
london pp  it will be seen at pp  and  that this
illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question
but had actually made no inconsiderable progress experimentally in the
very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by von
kempelen who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it is
without doubt I say it unhesitatingly and can prove it if required
indebted to the diary for at least the first hint of his own
undertaking

the paragraph from the courier and enquirer which is now going the
rounds of the press and which purports to claim the invention for a
mr kissam of brunswick maine appears to me I confess a little
apocryphal for several reasons although there is nothing either
impossible or very improbable in the statement made I need not go into
details my opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its
manner it does not look true persons who are narrating facts are
seldom so particular as mr kissam seems to be about day and date and
precise location besides if mr kissam actually did come upon the
discovery he says he did at the period designated nearly eight years
ago how happens it that he took no steps on the instant to reap the
immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have
resulted to him individually if not to the world at large from the
discovery it seems to me quite incredible that any man of common
understanding could have discovered what mr kissam says he did and yet
have subsequently acted so like a baby so like an owl as mr kissam
admits that he did by-the-way who is mr kissam and is not the whole
paragraph in the courier and enquirer a fabrication got up to make
a talk it must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air
very little dependence is to be placed upon it in my humble opinion
and if I were not well aware from experience how very easily men of
science are mystified on points out of their usual range of inquiry
I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as
professor draper discussing mr kissams or is it mr quizzems
pretensions to the discovery in so serious a tone

but to return to the diary of sir humphrey davy this pamphlet was not
designed for the public eye even upon the decease of the writer as any
person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by
the slightest inspection of the style at page  for example near the
middle we read in reference to his researches about the protoxide
of azote in less than half a minute the respiration being continued
diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure
on all the muscles that the respiration was not diminished is not
only clear by the subsequent context but by the use of the plural
were the sentence no doubt was thus intended in less than half
a minute the respiration being continued these feelings diminished
gradually and were succeeded by a sensation analogous to gentle
pressure on all the muscles a hundred similar instances go to show
that the ms so inconsiderately published was merely a rough note-book
meant only for the writers own eye but an inspection of the pamphlet
will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion
the fact is sir humphrey davy was about the last man in the world
to commit himself on scientific topics not only had he a more than
ordinary dislike to quackery but he was morbidly afraid of appearing
empirical so that however fully he might have been convinced that he
was on the right track in the matter now in question he would never
have spoken out until he had every thing ready for the most practical
demonstration I verily believe that his last moments would have been
rendered wretched could he have suspected that his wishes in regard
to burning this diary full of crude speculations would have been
unattended to as it seems they were I say his wishes for that he
meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed
to be burnt I think there can be no manner of doubt whether it
escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad yet remains to be seen
that the passages quoted above with the other similar ones referred to
gave von kempelen the hint I do not in the slightest degree question
but I repeat it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery
itself momentous under any circumstances will be of service or
disservice to mankind at large that von kempelen and his immediate
friends will reap a rich harvest it would be folly to doubt for a
moment they will scarcely be so weak as not to realize in time by
large purchases of houses and land with other property of intrinsic
value

in the brief account of von kempelen which appeared in the
home journal and has since been extensively copied several
misapprehensions of the german original seem to have been made by the
translator who professes to have taken the passage from a late number
of the presburg schnellpost viele has evidently been misconceived
as it often is and what the translator renders by sorrows is
probably lieden which in its true version sufferings would give
a totally different complexion to the whole account but of course
much of this is merely guess on my part

von kempelen however is by no means a misanthrope in appearance at
least whatever he may be in fact my acquaintance with him was casual
altogether and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know him
at all but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a
notoriety as he has attained or will attain in a few days is not a
small matter as times go

the literary world speaks of him confidently as a native of presburg
misled perhaps by the account in the home journal but I am pleased
in being able to state positively since I have it from his own lips
that he was born in utica in the state of new york although both his
parents I believe are of presburg descent the family is connected in
some way with maelzel of automaton-chess-player memory in person he
is short and stout with large fat blue eyes sandy hair and whiskers
a wide but pleasing mouth fine teeth and I think a roman nose there
is some defect in one of his feet his address is frank and his whole
manner noticeable for bonhomie altogether he looks speaks and
acts as little like a misanthrope as any man I ever saw we were
fellow-sojourners for a week about six years ago at earls hotel in
providence rhode island and I presume that I conversed with him at
various times for some three or four hours altogether his principal
topics were those of the day and nothing that fell from him led me
to suspect his scientific attainments he left the hotel before me
intending to go to new york and thence to bremen it was in the latter
city that his great discovery was first made public or rather it was
there that he was first suspected of having made it this is about all
that I personally know of the now immortal von kempelen but I have
thought that even these few details would have interest for the public

there can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat
about this affair are pure inventions entitled to about as much credit
as the story of aladdins lamp and yet in a case of this kind as in
the case of the discoveries in california it is clear that the truth
may be stranger than fiction the following anecdote at least is so
well authenticated that we may receive it implicitly

von kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence
at bremen and often it was well known he had been put to extreme
shifts in order to raise trifling sums when the great excitement
occurred about the forgery on the house of gutsmuth & co suspicion
was directed toward von kempelen on account of his having purchased
a considerable property in gasperitch lane and his refusing when
questioned to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money he
was at length arrested but nothing decisive appearing against him was
in the end set at liberty the police however kept a strict watch upon
his movements and thus discovered that he left home frequently taking
always the same road and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the
neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known
by the flash name of the dondergat finally by dint of great
perseverance they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven
stories in an alley called flatzplatz and coming upon him suddenly
found him as they imagined in the midst of his counterfeiting
operations his agitation is represented as so excessive that the
officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt after hand-cuffing
him they searched his room or rather rooms for it appears he occupied
all the mansarde

opening into the garret where they caught him was a closet ten feet by
eight fitted up with some chemical apparatus of which the object has
not yet been ascertained in one corner of the closet was a very small
furnace with a glowing fire in it and on the fire a kind of duplicate
crucible two crucibles connected by a tube one of these crucibles was
nearly full of lead in a state of fusion but not reaching up to the
aperture of the tube which was close to the brim the other crucible
had some liquid in it which as the officers entered seemed to be
furiously dissipating in vapor they relate that on finding himself
taken kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands which were encased
in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic and threw the
contents on the tiled floor it was now that they hand-cuffed him and
before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person but
nothing unusual was found about him excepting a paper parcel in his
coat-pocket containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture
of antimony and some unknown substance in nearly but not quite equal
proportions all attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have
so far failed but that it will ultimately be analyzed is not to be
doubted

passing out of the closet with their prisoner the officers went through
a sort of ante-chamber in which nothing material was found to the
chemists sleeping-room they here rummaged some drawers and boxes
but discovered only a few papers of no importance and some good coin
silver and gold at length looking under the bed they saw a large
common hair trunk without hinges hasp or lock and with the top lying
carelessly across the bottom portion upon attempting to draw this trunk
out from under the bed they found that with their united strength
there were three of them all powerful men they could not stir it
one inch much astonished at this one of them crawled under the bed
and looking into the trunk said

no wonder we couldnt move it why its full to the brim of old bits of
brass

putting his feet now against the wall so as to get a good purchase
and pushing with all his force while his companions pulled with all
theirs the trunk with much difficulty was slid out from under the
bed and its contents examined the supposed brass with which it was
filled was all in small smooth pieces varying from the size of a pea
to that of a dollar but the pieces were irregular in shape although
more or less flat-looking upon the whole very much as lead looks when
thrown upon the ground in a molten state and there suffered to grow
cool now not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal
to be any thing but brass the idea of its being gold never entered
their brains of course how could such a wild fancy have entered it
and their astonishment may be well conceived when the next day it
became known all over bremen that the lot of brass which they
had carted so contemptuously to the police office without putting
themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap was not only
gold real gold but gold far finer than any employed in coinage-gold
in fact absolutely pure virgin without the slightest appreciable
alloy

I need not go over the details of von kempelens confession as far as
it went and release for these are familiar to the public that he has
actually realized in spirit and in effect if not to the letter the
old chimaera of the philosophers stone no sane person is at liberty
to doubt the opinions of arago are of course entitled to the greatest
consideration but he is by no means infallible and what he says of
bismuth in his report to the academy must be taken cum grano salis
the simple truth is that up to this period all analysis has failed and
until von kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published
enigma it is more than probable that the matter will remain for years
in statu quo all that as yet can fairly be said to be known is that
pure gold can be made at will and very readily from lead in connection
with certain other substances in kind and in proportions unknown

speculation of course is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results
of this discovery a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate
in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally
by the late developments in california and this reflection brings us
inevitably to another the exceeding inopportuneness of von kempelens
analysis if many were prevented from adventuring to california by the
mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value
on account of its plentifulness in the mines there as to render
the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one what
impression will be wrought now upon the minds of those about to
emigrate and especially upon the minds of those actually in the
mineral region by the announcement of this astounding discovery of von
kempelen a discovery which declares in so many words that beyond its
intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes whatever that worth may be
gold now is or at least soon will be for it cannot be supposed that
von kempelen can long retain his secret of no greater value than
lead and of far inferior value to silver it is indeed exceedingly
difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the
discovery but one thing may be positively maintained that the
announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material
influence in regard to the settlement of california

in europe as yet the most noticeable results have been a rise of two
hundred per cent in the price of lead and nearly twenty-five per cent
that of silver




mesmeric revelation

 whatever doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism
its startling facts are now almost universally admitted of these
latter those who doubt are your mere doubters by profession an
unprofitable and disreputable tribe there can be no more absolute waste
of time than the attempt to prove at the present day that man by
mere exercise of will can so impress his fellow as to cast him into an
abnormal condition of which the phenomena resemble very closely those
of death or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the
phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance that
while in this state the person so impressed employs only with effort
and then feebly the external organs of sense yet perceives with
keenly refined perception and through channels supposed unknown
matters beyond the scope of the physical organs that moreover his
intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated that his
sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound and finally
that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency
while in the same proportion the peculiar phenomena elicited are more
extended and more pronounced

 I say that these which are the laws of mesmerism in its
general features it would be supererogation to demonstrate nor shall i
inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration to-day my purpose
at present is a very different one indeed I am impelled even in
the teeth of a world of prejudice to detail without comment the very
remarkable substance of a colloquy occurring between a sleep-waker and
myself

 I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in
question mr vankirk and the usual acute susceptibility and
exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened for many months he
had been laboring under confirmed phthisis the more distressing effects
of which had been relieved by my manipulations and on the night of
wednesday the fifteenth instant I was summoned to his bedside

 the invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the
heart and breathed with great difficulty having all the ordinary
symptoms of asthma in spasms such as these he had usually found relief
from the application of mustard to the nervous centres but to-night
this had been attempted in vain

 as I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile and
although evidently in much bodily pain appeared to be mentally quite
at ease

 I sent for you to-night he said not so much to administer
to my bodily ailment as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal
impressions which of late have occasioned me much anxiety and
surprise I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the
topic of the souls immortality I cannot deny that there has always
existed as if in that very soul which I have been denying a vague
half-sentiment of its own existence but this half-sentiment at no
time amounted to conviction with it my reason had nothing to do
all attempts at logical inquiry resulted indeed in leaving me more
sceptical than before I had been advised to study cousin I studied
him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american
echoes the charles elwood of mr brownson for example was placed
in my hands I read it with profound attention throughout I found it
logical but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily
the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book in his
summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even
succeeded in convincing himself his end had plainly forgotten his
beginning like the government of trinculo in short I was not long in
perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own
immortality he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions
which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of england of
france and of germany abstractions may amuse and exercise but take no
hold on the mind here upon earth at least philosophy I am persuaded
will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things the
will may assent the soul the intellect never

 I repeat then that I only half felt and never intellectually
believed but latterly there has been a certain deepening of the
feeling until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of
reason that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two I am
enabled too plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence
I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the
mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination
which in my abnormal existence convinces but which in full
accordance with the mesmeric phenomena does not extend except through
its effect into my normal condition in sleep-waking the reasoning
and its conclusion the cause and its effect are present together in
my natural state the cause vanishing the effect only and perhaps only
partially remains

 these considerations have led me to think that some good
results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions
propounded to me while mesmerized you have often observed the profound
self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker the extensive knowledge he
displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself and
from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of
a catechism

 I consented of course to make this experiment  a few passes
threw mr vankirk into the mesmeric sleep his breathing became
immediately more easy and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness
the following conversation then ensued v in the dialogue representing
the patient and p myself

 p are you asleep

 v yes no I would rather sleep more soundly

p after a few more passes do you sleep now

v yes

p how do you think your present illness will result

v after a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort I must
die

p does the idea of death afflict you

v very quickly no no

p are you pleased with the prospect

v if I were awake I should like to die but now it is no matter the
mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me

p I wish you would explain yourself mr vankirk

v I am willing to do so but it requires more effort than I feel able
to make you do not question me properly

p what then shall I ask

v you must begin at the beginning

p the beginning but where is the beginning

v you know that the beginning is god this was said in a low
fluctuating tone and with every sign of the most profound veneration

p what then is god

v hesitating for many minutes I cannot tell

p is not god spirit

v while I was awake I knew what you meant by spirit but now it
seems only a word such for instance as truth beauty a quality i
mean

p is not god immaterial

v there is no immateriality it is a mere word that which is not
matter is not at all unless qualities are things

p is god then material

v no this reply startled me very much

p what then is he

v after a long pause and mutteringly I see but it is a thing
difficult to tell another long pause he is not spirit for
he exists nor is he matter as you understand it but there are
gradations of matter of which man knows nothing the grosser impelling
the finer the finer pervading the grosser the atmosphere for example
impels the electric principle while the electric principle permeates
the atmosphere these gradations of matter increase in rarity
or fineness until we arrive at a matter unparticled without
particles indivisible one and here the law of impulsion and
permeation is modified the ultimate or unparticled matter not only
permeates all things but impels all things and thus is all things
within itself this matter is god what men attempt to embody in the
word thought is this matter in motion

p the metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion
and thinking and that the latter is the origin of the former

v yes and I now see the confusion of idea motion is the action
of mind not of thinking the unparticled matter or god in
quiescence is as nearly as we can conceive it what men call mind and
the power of self-movement equivalent in effect to human volition is
in the unparticled matter the result of its unity and omniprevalence
how I know not and now clearly see that I shall never know but the
unparticled matter set in motion by a law or quality existing within
itself is thinking

p can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the
unparticled matter

v the matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in
gradation we have for example a metal a piece of wood a drop of
water the atmosphere a gas caloric electricity the luminiferous
ether now we call all these things matter and embrace all matter in
one general definition but in spite of this there can be no two ideas
more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal and that
which we attach to the luminiferous ether when we reach the latter we
feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit or with
nihility the only consideration which restrains us is our conception
of its atomic constitution and here even we have to seek aid from
our notion of an atom as something possessing in infinite minuteness
solidity palpability weight destroy the idea of the atomic
constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an
entity or at least as matter for want of a better word we might term
it spirit take now a step beyond the luminiferous ether conceive a
matter as much more rare than the ether as this ether is more rare than
the metal and we arrive at once in spite of all the school dogmas at
a unique mass an unparticled matter for although we may admit infinite
littleness in the atoms themselves the infinitude of littleness in the
spaces between them is an absurdity there will be a point there will
be a degree of rarity at which if the atoms are sufficiently numerous
the interspaces must vanish and the mass absolutely coalesce but
the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away the
nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit it
is clear however that it is as fully matter as before the truth is
it is impossible to conceive spirit since it is impossible to
imagine what is not when we flatter ourselves that we have formed
its conception we have merely deceived our understanding by the
consideration of infinitely rarified matter

p there seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea
of absolute coalescence and that is the very slight resistance
experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space a
resistance now ascertained it is true to exist in some degree but
which is nevertheless so slight as to have been quite overlooked by
the sagacity even of newton we know that the resistance of bodies
is chiefly in proportion to their density absolute coalescence
is absolute density where there are no interspaces there can be no
yielding an ether absolutely dense would put an infinitely more
effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant
or of iron

v your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the
ratio of its apparent unanswerability as regards the progress of the
star it can make no difference whether the star passes through the
ether or the ether through it there is no astronomical error more
unaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the
comets with the idea of their passage through an ether for however
rare this ether be supposed it would put a stop to all sidereal
revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those
astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found
it impossible to comprehend the retardation actually experienced is on
the other hand about that which might be expected from the friction
of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb in the one
case the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself in
the other it is endlessly accumulative

p but in all this in this identification of mere matter with god is
there nothing of irreverence I was forced to repeat this question
before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning

v can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind but
you forget that the matter of which I speak is in all respects the
very mind or spirit of the schools so far as regards its high
capacities and is moreover the matter of these schools at the
same time god with all the powers attributed to spirit is but the
perfection of matter

p you assert then that the unparticled matter in motion is
thought

v in general this motion is the universal thought of the universal
mind this thought creates all created things are but the thoughts of
god

p you say in general

v yes the universal mind is god for new individualities matter
is necessary

p but you now speak of mind and matter as do the metaphysicians

v yes to avoid confusion when I say mind I mean the unparticled
or ultimate matter by matter I intend all else

p you were saying that for new individualities matter is necessary

v yes for mind existing unincorporate is merely god to create
individual thinking beings it was necessary to incarnate portions
of the divine mind thus man is individualized divested of corporate
investiture he were god now the particular motion of the incarnated
portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man as the motion
of the whole is that of god

p you say that divested of the body man will be god

v after much hesitation I could not have said this it is an
absurdity

p referring to my notes you did say that divested of
corporate investiture man were god

v and this is true man thus divested would be god would be
unindividualized but he can never be thus divested at least never
will be else we must imagine an action of god returning upon
itself a purposeless and futile action man is a creature creatures
are thoughts of god it is the nature of thought to be irrevocable

p I do not comprehend you say that man will never put off the body

v I say that he will never be bodiless

p explain

v there are two bodies the rudimental and the complete
corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly
what we call death is but the painful metamorphosis our present
incarnation is progressive preparatory temporary our future is
perfected ultimate immortal the ultimate life is the full design

p but of the worms metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant

v we certainly but not the worm the matter of which our
rudimental body is composed is within the ken of the organs of that
body or more distinctly our rudimental organs are adapted to the
matter of which is formed the rudimental body but not to that of which
the ultimate is composed the ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental
senses and we perceive only the shell which falls in decaying from
the inner form not that inner form itself but this inner form as
well as the shell is appreciable by those who have already acquired the
ultimate life

p you have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles
death how is this

v when I say that it resembles death I mean that it resembles the
ultimate life for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental
life are in abeyance and I perceive external things directly
without organs through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate
unorganized life

p unorganized

v yes organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought
into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter to
the exclusion of other classes and forms the organs of man are adapted
to his rudimental condition and to that only his ultimate condition
being unorganized is of unlimited comprehension in all points but
one the nature of the volition of god that is to say the motion of
the unparticled matter you will have a distinct idea of the ultimate
body by conceiving it to be entire brain this it is not but a
conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it
is a luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether
the vibrations generate similar ones within the retina these again
communicate similar ones to the optic nerve the nerve conveys similar
ones to the brain the brain also similar ones to the unparticled
matter which permeates it the motion of this latter is thought of
which perception is the first undulation this is the mode by which the
mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world and
this external world is to the rudimental life limited through the
idiosyncrasy of its organs but in the ultimate unorganized life the
external world reaches the whole body which is of a substance having
affinity to brain as I have said with no other intervention than that
of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous and to this
ether in unison with it the whole body vibrates setting in motion
the unparticled matter which permeates it it is to the absence of
idiosyncratic organs therefore that we must attribute the nearly
unlimited perception of the ultimate life to rudimental beings organs
are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged

p you speak of rudimental beings are there other rudimental
thinking beings than man

v the multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ
planets suns and other bodies which are neither nebulæ suns
nor planets is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the
idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings but for
the necessity of the rudimental prior to the ultimate life there
would have been no bodies such as these each of these is tenanted by a
distinct variety of organic rudimental thinking creatures in all
the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted at death
or metamorphosis these creatures enjoying the ultimate
life immortality and cognizant of all secrets but the one act all
things and pass everywhere by mere volition indwelling not the stars
which to us seem the sole palpabilities and for the accommodation
of which we blindly deem space created but that space itself that
infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the
star-shadows blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of
the angels

p you say that but for the necessity of the rudimental life there
would have been no stars but why this necessity

v in the inorganic life as well as in the inorganic matter
generally there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique
law the divine volition with the view of producing impediment the
organic life and matter complex substantial and law-encumbered
were contrived

p but again why need this impediment have been produced

v the result of law inviolate is perfection right negative
happiness the result of law violate is imperfection wrong positive
pain through the impediments afforded by the number complexity and
substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter the violation of
law is rendered to a certain extent practicable thus pain which in
the inorganic life is impossible is possible in the organic

p but to what good end is pain thus rendered possible

v all things are either good or bad by comparison a sufficient
analysis will show that pleasure in all cases is but the contrast of
pain positive pleasure is a mere idea to be happy at any one point
we must have suffered at the same never to suffer would have been never
to have been blessed but it has been shown that in the inorganic
life pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic the pain of the
primitive life of earth is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate
life in heaven

p still there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible
to comprehend the truly substantive vastness of infinity

v this probably is because you have no sufficiently generic
conception of the term substance itself we must not regard it as a
quality but as a sentiment it is the perception in thinking beings
of the adaptation of matter to their organization there are many things
on the earth which would be nihility to the inhabitants of venus many
things visible and tangible in venus which we could not be brought
to appreciate as existing at all but to the inorganic beings to the
angels the whole of the unparticled matter is substance that is
to say the whole of what we term space is to them the truest
substantiality the stars meantime through what we consider their
materiality escaping the angelic sense just in proportion as the
unparticled matter through what we consider its immateriality eludes
the organic

  as the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words in a feeble tone
I observed on his countenance a singular expression which somewhat
alarmed me and induced me to awake him at once no sooner had I done
this than with a bright smile irradiating all his features he fell
back upon his pillow and expired I noticed that in less than a minute
afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone his brow was
of the coldness of ice thus ordinarily should it have appeared only
after long pressure from azraels hand had the sleep-waker indeed
during the latter portion of his discourse been addressing me from out
the region of the shadows




the facts in the case of m valdemar

of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder that
the extraordinary case of m valdemar has excited discussion it would
have been a miracle had it not-especially under the circumstances
through the desire of all parties concerned to keep the affair from the
public at least for the present or until we had farther opportunities
for investigation through our endeavors to effect this a garbled or
exaggerated account made its way into society and became the source of
many unpleasant misrepresentations and very naturally of a great deal
of disbelief

it is now rendered necessary that I give the facts as far as i
comprehend them myself they are succinctly these

my attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn to
the subject of mesmerism and about nine months ago it occurred to me
quite suddenly that in the series of experiments made hitherto there
had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission no person
had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis it remained to be seen
first whether in such condition there existed in the patient any
susceptibility to the magnetic influence secondly whether if any
existed it was impaired or increased by the condition thirdly to what
extent or for how long a period the encroachments of death might be
arrested by the process there were other points to be ascertained
but these most excited my curiosity the last in especial from the
immensely important character of its consequences

in looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these
particulars I was brought to think of my friend m ernest valdemar
the well-known compiler of the bibliotheca forensica and author
under the nom de plume of issachar marx of the polish versions of
wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar who has resided principally
at harlaem ny since the year  is or was particularly
noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person his lower limbs much
resembling those of john randolph and also for the whiteness of his
whiskers in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair the latter
in consequence being very generally mistaken for a wig his temperament
was markedly nervous and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric
experiment on two or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little
difficulty but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar
constitution had naturally led me to anticipate his will was at no
period positively or thoroughly under my control and in regard to
clairvoyance I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon i
always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of
his health for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with
him his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis it was his
custom indeed to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution as of a
matter neither to be avoided nor regretted

when the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me it was
of course very natural that I should think of m valdemar I knew the
steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples
from him and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to
interfere I spoke to him frankly upon the subject and to my surprise
his interest seemed vividly excited I say to my surprise for although
he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments he had never
before given me any tokens of sympathy with what I did his disease was
of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect
to the epoch of its termination in death and it was finally arranged
between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the
period announced by his physicians as that of his decease

it is now rather more than seven months since I received from m
valdemar himself the subjoined note

my dear p -

you may as well come now d   and f   are agreed that I cannot hold out
beyond to-morrow midnight and I think they have hit the time very
nearly

valdemar

I received this note within half an hour after it was written and in
fifteen minutes more I was in the dying mans chamber I had not seen
him for ten days and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the
brief interval had wrought in him his face wore a leaden hue the eyes
were utterly lustreless and the emaciation was so extreme that the
skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones his expectoration was
excessive the pulse was barely perceptible he retained nevertheless
in a very remarkable manner both his mental power and a certain degree
of physical strength he spoke with distinctness took some palliative
medicines without aid and when I entered the room was occupied in
penciling memoranda in a pocket-book he was propped up in the bed by
pillows doctors d   and f   were in attendance

after pressing valdemars hand I took these gentlemen aside and
obtained from them a minute account of the patients condition the left
lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous
state and was of course entirely useless for all purposes of
vitality the right in its upper portion was also partially if
not thoroughly ossified while the lower region was merely a mass
of purulent tubercles running one into another several extensive
perforations existed and at one point permanent adhesion to the
ribs had taken place these appearances in the right lobe were of
comparatively recent date the ossification had proceeded with very
unusual rapidity no sign of it had been discovered a month before and
the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days
independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of aneurism
of the aorta but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact
diagnosis impossible it was the opinion of both physicians that m
valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow sunday it was then
seven oclock on saturday evening

on quitting the invalids bed-side to hold conversation with myself
doctors d   and f   had bidden him a final farewell it had not been their
intention to return but at my request they agreed to look in upon the
patient about ten the next night

when they had gone I spoke freely with m valdemar on the subject
of his approaching dissolution as well as more particularly of the
experiment proposed he still professed himself quite willing and even
anxious to have it made and urged me to commence it at once a male and
a female nurse were in attendance but I did not feel myself altogether
at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable
witnesses than these people in case of sudden accident might prove
I therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night when
the arrival of a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance mr
theodore l l relieved me from farther embarrassment it had been my
design originally to wait for the physicians but I was induced to
proceed first by the urgent entreaties of m valdemar and secondly
by my conviction that I had not a moment to lose as he was evidently
sinking fast

mr l l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes
of all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that what I now have
to relate is for the most part either condensed or copied verbatim

it wanted about five minutes of eight when taking the patients hand i
begged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr l l whether he
m valdemar was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of
mesmerizing him in his then condition

he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes I wish to be I fear you
have mesmerized adding immediately afterwards deferred it too long

while he spoke thus I commenced the passes which I had already found
most effectual in subduing him he was evidently influenced with the
first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but although i
exerted all my powers no further perceptible effect was induced
until some minutes after ten oclock when doctors d  and f  called
according to appointment I explained to them in a few words what i
designed and as they opposed no objection saying that the patient was
already in the death agony I proceeded without hesitation exchanging
however the lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gaze
entirely into the right eye of the sufferer

by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was
stertorous and at intervals of half a minute

this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour at the
expiration of this period however a natural although a very deep
sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man and the stertorous breathing
ceased that is to say its stertorousness was no longer apparent the
intervals were undiminished the patients extremities were of an icy
coldness

at five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of the
mesmeric influence the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that
expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in
cases of sleep-waking and which it is quite impossible to mistake
with a few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver as in incipient
sleep and with a few more I closed them altogether I was not
satisfied however with this but continued the manipulations
vigorously and with the fullest exertion of the will until I had
completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer after placing them in
a seemingly easy position the legs were at full length the arms were
nearly so and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin
the head was very slightly elevated

when I had accomplished this it was fully midnight and I requested
the gentlemen present to examine m valdemars condition after a few
experiments they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of
mesmeric trance the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly
excited dr d   resolved at once to remain with the patient all
night while dr f   took leave with a promise to return at daybreak
mr l l and the nurses remained

we left m valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three oclock in
the morning when I approached him and found him in precisely the same
condition as when dr f went away that is to say he lay in the
same position the pulse was imperceptible the breathing was gentle
scarcely noticeable unless through the application of a mirror to the
lips the eyes were closed naturally and the limbs were as rigid and
as cold as marble still the general appearance was certainly not that
of death

as I approached m valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence
his right arm into pursuit of my own as I passed the latter gently
to and fro above his person in such experiments with this patient I had
never perfectly succeeded before and assuredly I had little thought of
succeeding now but to my astonishment his arm very readily although
feebly followed every direction I assigned it with mine I determined
to hazard a few words of conversation

m valdemar I said are you asleep he made no answer but i
perceived a tremor about the lips and was thus induced to repeat the
question again and again at its third repetition his whole frame was
agitated by a very slight shivering the eyelids unclosed themselves so
far as to display a white line of the ball the lips moved sluggishly
and from between them in a barely audible whisper issued the words

yes asleep now do not wake me let me die so

I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever the right arm
as before obeyed the direction of my hand I questioned the sleep-waker
again

do you still feel pain in the breast m valdemar

the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before no
pain I am dying

I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then and
nothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr f  who came a
little before sunrise and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding
the patient still alive after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror
to the lips he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again I did
so saying

m valdemar do you still sleep

as before some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made and during the
interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak
at my fourth repetition of the question he said very faintly almost
inaudibly

yes still asleep dying

it was now the opinion or rather the wish of the physicians that
m valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present
apparently tranquil condition until death should supervene and this
it was generally agreed must now take place within a few minutes i
concluded however to speak to him once more and merely repeated my
previous question

while I spoke there came a marked change over the countenance of
the sleep-waker the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the pupils
disappearing upwardly the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue
resembling not so much parchment as white paper and the circular hectic
spots which hitherto had been strongly defined in the centre of each
cheek went out at once I use this expression because the
suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the
extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath the upper lip
at the same time writhed itself away from the teeth which it had
previously covered completely while the lower jaw fell with an audible
jerk leaving the mouth widely extended and disclosing in full view the
swollen and blackened tongue I presume that no member of the party
then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors but so hideous
beyond conception was the appearance of m valdemar at this moment that
there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed

I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every
reader will be startled into positive disbelief it is my business
however simply to proceed

there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m valdemar and
concluding him to be dead we were consigning him to the charge of the
nurses when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue
this continued for perhaps a minute at the expiration of this period
there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice such as it
would be madness in me to attempt describing there are indeed two or
three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part i
might say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and hollow
but the hideous whole is indescribable for the simple reason that no
similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity there were two
particulars nevertheless which I thought then and still think might
fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation as well adapted to
convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity in the first place the
voice seemed to reach our ears at least mine from a vast distance
or from some deep cavern within the earth in the second place it
impressed me I fear indeed that it will be impossible to make myself
comprehended as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of
touch

I have spoken both of sound and of voice I mean to say that
the sound was one of distinct of even wonderfully thrillingly
distinct syllabification m valdemar spoke obviously in reply to the
question I had propounded to him a few minutes before I had asked him
it will be remembered if he still slept he now said

yes no I have been sleeping and now now I am dead

no person present even affected to deny or attempted to repress the
unutterable shuddering horror which these few words thus uttered were
so well calculated to convey mr l l the student swooned the nurses
immediately left the chamber and could not be induced to return my own
impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader
for nearly an hour we busied ourselves silently without the utterance
of a word in endeavors to revive mr l l when he came to himself
we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of m valdemars
condition

it remained in all respects as I have last described it with the
exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration an
attempt to draw blood from the arm failed I should mention too that
this limb was no farther subject to my will I endeavored in vain to
make it follow the direction of my hand the only real indication
indeed of the mesmeric influence was now found in the vibratory
movement of the tongue whenever I addressed m valdemar a question
he seemed to be making an effort to reply but had no longer sufficient
volition to queries put to him by any other person than myself he
seemed utterly insensible although I endeavored to place each member
of the company in mesmeric rapport with him I believe that I have now
related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-wakers
state at this epoch other nurses were procured and at ten oclock i
left the house in company with the two physicians and mr l l

in the afternoon we all called again to see the patient his condition
remained precisely the same we had now some discussion as to the
propriety and feasibility of awakening him but we had little difficulty
in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing it was
evident that so far death or what is usually termed death had been
arrested by the mesmeric process it seemed clear to us all that to
awaken m valdemar would be merely to insure his instant or at least
his speedy dissolution

from this period until the close of last week an interval of nearly
seven months we continued to make daily calls at m valdemars house
accompanied now and then by medical and other friends all this time
the sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him the
nurses attentions were continual

it was on friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment
of awakening or attempting to awaken him and it is the perhaps
unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to
so much discussion in private circles to so much of what I cannot help
thinking unwarranted popular feeling

for the purpose of relieving m valdemar from the mesmeric trance i
made use of the customary passes these for a time were unsuccessful
the first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the
iris it was observed as especially remarkable that this lowering
of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish
ichor from beneath the lids of a pungent and highly offensive odor

it was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patients
arm as heretofore I made the attempt and failed dr f then intimated
a desire to have me put a question I did so as follows

m valdemar can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes
now

there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks the
tongue quivered or rather rolled violently in the mouth although the
jaws and lips remained rigid as before and at length the same hideous
voice which I have already described broke forth

for gods sake quick quick put me to sleep or quick waken
me quick I say to you that I am dead

I was thoroughly unnerved and for an instant remained undecided what to
do at first I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient but failing
in this through total abeyance of the will I retraced my steps and as
earnestly struggled to awaken him in this attempt I soon saw that i
should be successful or at least I soon fancied that my success would
be complete and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the
patient awaken

for what really occurred however it is quite impossible that any human
being could have been prepared

as I rapidly made the mesmeric passes amid ejaculations of dead
dead absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the
sufferer his whole frame at once within the space of a single minute
or even less shrunk crumbled absolutely rotted away beneath my hands
upon the bed before that whole company there lay a nearly liquid mass
of loathsome of detestable putridity




the black cat

for the most wild yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen i
neither expect nor solicit belief mad indeed would I be to expect it
in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence yet mad am i
not and very surely do I not dream but to-morrow I die and to-day
I would unburthen my soul my immediate purpose is to place before
the world plainly succinctly and without comment a series of
mere household events in their consequences these events have
terrified have tortured have destroyed me yet I will not attempt to
expound them to me they have presented little but horror to many
they will seem less terrible than barroques hereafter perhaps
some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the
common-place some intellect more calm more logical and far less
excitable than my own which will perceive in the circumstances i
detail with awe nothing more than an ordinary succession of very
natural causes and effects

from my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my
disposition my tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make
me the jest of my companions I was especially fond of animals and was
indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets with these I spent
most of my time and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing
them this peculiarity of character grew with my growth and in my
manhood I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure to
those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious
dog I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the
intensity of the gratification thus derivable there is something in the
unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute which goes directly
to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry
friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man

I married early and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not
uncongenial with my own observing my partiality for domestic pets she
lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind we
had birds gold-fish a fine dog rabbits a small monkey and a cat

this latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal entirely black
and sagacious to an astonishing degree in speaking of his intelligence
my wife who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition
made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion which regarded all
black cats as witches in disguise not that she was ever serious upon
this point and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than
that it happens just now to be remembered

pluto this was the cats name was my favorite pet and playmate i
alone fed him and he attended me wherever I went about the house it
was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me
through the streets

our friendship lasted in this manner for several years during which
my general temperament and character through the instrumentality of the
fiend intemperance had I blush to confess it experienced a radical
alteration for the worse I grew day by day more moody more
irritable more regardless of the feelings of others I suffered myself
to use intemperate language to my wife at length I even offered her
personal violence my pets of course were made to feel the change
in my disposition I not only neglected but ill-used them for
pluto however I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from
maltreating him as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits the
monkey or even the dog when by accident or through affection they
came in my way but my disease grew upon me for what disease is like
alcohol and at length even pluto who was now becoming old and
consequently somewhat peevish even pluto began to experience the
effects of my ill temper

one night returning home much intoxicated from one of my haunts about
town I fancied that the cat avoided my presence I seized him when in
his fright at my violence he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with
his teeth the fury of a demon instantly possessed me I knew myself
no longer my original soul seemed at once to take its flight from my
body and a more than fiendish malevolence gin-nurtured thrilled every
fibre of my frame I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife opened
it grasped the poor beast by the throat and deliberately cut one of
its eyes from the socket I blush I burn I shudder while I pen the
damnable atrocity

when reason returned with the morning when I had slept off the fumes of
the nights debauch I experienced a sentiment half of horror half of
remorse for the crime of which I had been guilty but it was at best
a feeble and equivocal feeling and the soul remained untouched I again
plunged into excess and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed

in the meantime the cat slowly recovered the socket of the lost eye
presented it is true a frightful appearance but he no longer appeared
to suffer any pain he went about the house as usual but as might be
expected fled in extreme terror at my approach I had so much of my
old heart left as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on
the part of a creature which had once so loved me but this feeling
soon gave place to irritation and then came as if to my final and
irrevocable overthrow the spirit of perverseness of this spirit
philosophy takes no account yet I am not more sure that my soul lives
than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the
human heart one of the indivisible primary faculties or sentiments
which give direction to the character of man who has not a hundred
times found himself committing a vile or a silly action for no other
reason than because he knows he should not have we not a perpetual
inclination in the teeth of our best judgment to violate that which
is law merely because we understand it to be such this spirit
of perverseness I say came to my final overthrow it was this
unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself to offer violence to
its own nature to do wrong for the wrongs sake only that urged me to
continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the
unoffending brute one morning in cool blood I slipped a noose about
its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree hung it with the
tears streaming from my eyes and with the bitterest remorse at my
heart hung it because I knew that it had loved me and because
I felt it had given me no reason of offence hung it because I knew
that in so doing I was committing a sin a deadly sin that would
so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it if such a thing wore
possible even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the most
merciful and most terrible god

on the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done I was aroused
from sleep by the cry of fire the curtains of my bed were in flames
the whole house was blazing it was with great difficulty that my wife
a servant and myself made our escape from the conflagration the
destruction was complete my entire worldly wealth was swallowed up and
I resigned myself thenceforward to despair

I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause
and effect between the disaster and the atrocity but I am detailing a
chain of facts and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect
on the day succeeding the fire I visited the ruins the walls with
one exception had fallen in this exception was found in a compartment
wall not very thick which stood about the middle of the house and
against which had rested the head of my bed the plastering had here
in great measure resisted the action of the fire a fact which i
attributed to its having been recently spread about this wall a
dense crowd were collected and many persons seemed to be examining a
particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention the
words strange singular and other similar expressions excited my
curiosity I approached and saw as if graven in bas relief upon the
white surface the figure of a gigantic cat the impression was given
with an accuracy truly marvellous there was a rope about the animals
neck

when I first beheld this apparition for I could scarcely regard it as
less my wonder and my terror were extreme but at length reflection
came to my aid the cat I remembered had been hung in a garden
adjacent to the house upon the alarm of fire this garden had been
immediately filled by the crowd by some one of whom the animal must
have been cut from the tree and thrown through an open window into my
chamber this had probably been done with the view of arousing me
from sleep the falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my
cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster the lime of
which with the flames and the ammonia from the carcass had then
accomplished the portraiture as I saw it

although I thus readily accounted to my reason if not altogether to my
conscience for the startling fact just detailed it did not the less
fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy for months I could not rid
myself of the phantasm of the cat and during this period there came
back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed but was not remorse
I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal and to look about me
among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented for another pet
of the same species and of somewhat similar appearance with which to
supply its place

one night as I sat half stupified in a den of more than infamy my
attention was suddenly drawn to some black object reposing upon
the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin or of rum which
constituted the chief furniture of the apartment I had been looking
steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes and what now
caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the
object thereupon I approached it and touched it with my hand it was
a black cat a very large one fully as large as pluto and closely
resembling him in every respect but one pluto had not a white hair upon
any portion of his body but this cat had a large although indefinite
splotch of white covering nearly the whole region of the breast upon
my touching him he immediately arose purred loudly rubbed against my
hand and appeared delighted with my notice this then was the very
creature of which I was in search I at once offered to purchase it
of the landlord but this person made no claim to it knew nothing of
it had never seen it before

I continued my caresses and when I prepared to go home the animal
evinced a disposition to accompany me I permitted it to do so
occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded when it reached
the house it domesticated itself at once and became immediately a great
favorite with my wife

for my own part I soon found a dislike to it arising within me this
was just the reverse of what I had anticipated but I know not how
or why it was its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and
annoyed by slow degrees these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose
into the bitterness of hatred I avoided the creature a certain sense
of shame and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty preventing
me from physically abusing it I did not for some weeks strike or
otherwise violently ill use it but gradually very gradually I came
to look upon it with unutterable loathing and to flee silently from its
odious presence as from the breath of a pestilence

what added no doubt to my hatred of the beast was the discovery on
the morning after I brought it home that like pluto it also had been
deprived of one of its eyes this circumstance however only endeared
it to my wife who as I have already said possessed in a high degree
that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait
and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures

with my aversion to this cat however its partiality for myself seemed
to increase it followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would
be difficult to make the reader comprehend whenever I sat it would
crouch beneath my chair or spring upon my knees covering me with its
loathsome caresses if I arose to walk it would get between my feet and
thus nearly throw me down or fastening its long and sharp claws in my
dress clamber in this manner to my breast at such times although
I longed to destroy it with a blow I was yet withheld from so doing
partly by a memory of my former crime but chiefly let me confess it at
once by absolute dread of the beast

this dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil and yet I should be
at a loss how otherwise to define it I am almost ashamed to own yes
even in this felons cell I am almost ashamed to own that the terror
and horror with which the animal inspired me had been heightened by one
of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive my wife had
called my attention more than once to the character of the mark of
white hair of which I have spoken and which constituted the sole
visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had
destroyed the reader will remember that this mark although large had
been originally very indefinite but by slow degrees degrees nearly
imperceptible and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject
as fanciful it had at length assumed a rigorous distinctness of
outline it was now the representation of an object that I shudder to
name and for this above all I loathed and dreaded and would have
rid myself of the monster had I dared it was now I say the image
of a hideous of a ghastly thing of the gallows oh mournful and
terrible engine of horror and of crime of agony and of death

and now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere humanity
and a brute beast  whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed a
brute beast to work out for me for me a man fashioned in the image
of the high god so much of insufferable wo alas neither by day nor
by night knew I the blessing of rest any more during the former the
creature left me no moment alone and in the latter I started hourly
from dreams of unutterable fear to find the hot breath of the thing
upon my face and its vast weight an incarnate night-mare that I had no
power to shake off incumbent eternally upon my heart

beneath the pressure of torments such as these the feeble remnant
of the good within me succumbed evil thoughts became my sole
intimates the darkest and most evil of thoughts the moodiness of
my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind
while from the sudden frequent and ungovernable outbursts of a fury
to which I now blindly abandoned myself my uncomplaining wife alas
was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers

one day she accompanied me upon some household errand into the cellar
of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit the cat
followed me down the steep stairs and nearly throwing me headlong
exasperated me to madness uplifting an axe and forgetting in my
wrath the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand I aimed a
blow at the animal which of course would have proved instantly fatal
had it descended as I wished but this blow was arrested by the hand of
my wife goaded by the interference into a rage more than demoniacal
I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain she
fell dead upon the spot without a groan

this hideous murder accomplished I set myself forthwith and with
entire deliberation to the task of concealing the body I knew that i
could not remove it from the house either by day or by night without
the risk of being observed by the neighbors many projects entered
my mind at one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute
fragments and destroying them by fire at another I resolved to dig
a grave for it in the floor of the cellar again I deliberated about
casting it in the well in the yard about packing it in a box as if
merchandize with the usual arrangements and so getting a porter to
take it from the house finally I hit upon what I considered a far
better expedient than either of these I determined to wall it up in the
cellar as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up
their victims

for a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted its walls were
loosely constructed and had lately been plastered throughout with a
rough plaster which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from
hardening moreover in one of the walls was a projection caused by
a false chimney or fireplace that had been filled up and made to
resemble the red of the cellar I made no doubt that I could readily
displace the bricks at this point insert the corpse and wall the whole
up as before so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious and in
this calculation I was not deceived by means of a crow-bar I easily
dislodged the bricks and having carefully deposited the body against
the inner wall I propped it in that position while with little
trouble I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood having
procured mortar sand and hair with every possible precaution i
prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old and
with this I very carefully went over the new brickwork when I had
finished I felt satisfied that all was right the wall did not present
the slightest appearance of having been disturbed the rubbish on
the floor was picked up with the minutest care I looked around
triumphantly and said to myself here at least then my labor has not
been in vain

my next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so
much wretchedness for I had at length firmly resolved to put it to
death had I been able to meet with it at the moment there could have
been no doubt of its fate but it appeared that the crafty animal had
been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger and forebore to
present itself in my present mood it is impossible to describe or to
imagine the deep the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the
detested creature occasioned in my bosom it did not make its
appearance during the night and thus for one night at least since its
introduction into the house I soundly and tranquilly slept aye slept
even with the burden of murder upon my soul

the second and the third day passed and still my tormentor came not
once again I breathed as a freeman the monster in terror had fled the
premises forever I should behold it no more my happiness was supreme
the guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little some few inquiries
had been made but these had been readily answered even a search had
been instituted but of course nothing was to be discovered I looked
upon my future felicity as secured

upon the fourth day of the assassination a party of the police came
very unexpectedly into the house and proceeded again to make rigorous
investigation of the premises secure however in the inscrutability of
my place of concealment I felt no embarrassment whatever the officers
bade me accompany them in their search they left no nook or corner
unexplored at length for the third or fourth time they descended into
the cellar I quivered not in a muscle my heart beat calmly as that of
one who slumbers in innocence I walked the cellar from end to end i
folded my arms upon my bosom and roamed easily to and fro the police
were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart the glee at my heart
was too strong to be restrained I burned to say if but one word by
way of triumph and to render doubly sure their assurance of my
guiltlessness

gentlemen I said at last as the party ascended the steps I delight
to have allayed your suspicions I wish you all health and a little
more courtesy by the bye gentlemen this this is a very well
constructed house in the rabid desire to say something easily i
scarcely knew what I uttered at all I may say an excellently well
constructed house these walls are you going gentlemen these walls
are solidly put together and here through the mere phrenzy of
bravado I rapped heavily with a cane which I held in my hand upon
that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the
wife of my bosom

but may god shield and deliver me from the fangs of the arch-fiend no
sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence than I was
answered by a voice from within the tomb by a cry at first muffled
and broken like the sobbing of a child and then quickly swelling into
one long loud and continuous scream utterly anomalous and inhuman a
howl a wailing shriek half of horror and half of triumph such as
might have arisen only out of hell conjointly from the throats of the
dammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation

of my own thoughts it is folly to speak swooning I staggered to
the opposite wall for one instant the party upon the stairs remained
motionless through extremity of terror and of awe in the next a dozen
stout arms were toiling at the wall it fell bodily the corpse already
greatly decayed and clotted with gore stood erect before the eyes of
the spectators upon its head with red extended mouth and solitary eye
of fire sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder
and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman I had walled
the monster up within the tomb




the fall of the house of usher

     son coeur est un luth suspendu
     sitôt quon le touche il rèsonne

                               de béranger

during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the
year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens I had
been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of
country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew
on within view of the melancholy house of usher I know not how
it was but with the first glimpse of the building a sense of
insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit I say insufferable for the
feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable because poetic
sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest
natural images of the desolate or terrible I looked upon the scene
before me upon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the
domain upon the bleak walls upon the vacant eye-like windows upon a
few rank sedges and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees with an
utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation
more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium the
bitter lapse into everyday life the hideous dropping off of the veil
there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heart an unredeemed
dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture
into aught of the sublime what was it I paused to think what was it
that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher it was a
mystery all insoluble nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that
crowded upon me as I pondered I was forced to fall back upon the
unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are
combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus
affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations
beyond our depth it was possible I reflected that a mere different
arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the
picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its
capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea I reined
my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in
unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed down but with a shudder
even more thrilling than before upon the remodelled and inverted images
of the gray sedge and the ghastly tree-stems and the vacant and
eye-like windows

nevertheless in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a
sojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been one of
my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last
meeting a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of
the country a letter from him which in its wildly importunate nature
had admitted of no other than a personal reply the ms gave evidence of
nervous agitation the writer spoke of acute bodily illness of a mental
disorder which oppressed him and of an earnest desire to see me as his
best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by
the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady it
was the manner in which all this and much more was said it was the
apparent heart that went with his request which allowed me no
room for hesitation and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still
considered a very singular summons

although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet I really
knew little of my friend his reserve had been always excessive and
habitual I was aware however that his very ancient family had been
noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament
displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and
manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive
charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps
even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of
musical science I had learned too the very remarkable fact that the
stem of the usher race all time-honored as it was had put forth at no
period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay
in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and
very temporary variation so lain it was this deficiency I considered
while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of
the premises with the accredited character of the people and while
speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long
lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the other it was this
deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating
transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which
had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title
of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house
of usher an appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the
peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion

I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish
experiment that of looking down within the tarn had been to deepen the
first singular impression there can be no doubt that the consciousness
of the rapid increase of my superstition for why should I not so term
it served mainly to accelerate the increase itself such I have
long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a
basis and it might have been for this reason only that when I again
uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there
grew in my mind a strange fancy a fancy so ridiculous indeed that i
but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed
me I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that
about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar
to themselves and their immediate vicinity an atmosphere which had
no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the
decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarn a pestilent and
mystic vapor dull sluggish faintly discernible and leaden-hued

shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream I scanned more
narrowly the real aspect of the building its principal feature seemed
to be that of an excessive antiquity the discoloration of ages had been
great minute fungI overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine
tangled web-work from the eaves yet all this was apart from any
extraordinary dilapidation no portion of the masonry had fallen and
there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect
adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual
stones in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality
of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected
vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air beyond
this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little
token of instability perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might
have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the
roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag
direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn

noticing these things I rode over a short causeway to the house a
servant in waiting took my horse and I entered the gothic archway of
the hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence
through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio
of his master much that I encountered on the way contributed I know
not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already
spoken while the objects around me while the carvings of the ceilings
the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors
and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode were
but matters to which or to such as which I had been accustomed from my
infancy while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all
this I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which
ordinary images were stirring up on one of the staircases I met the
physician of the family his countenance I thought wore a mingled
expression of low cunning and perplexity he accosted me with
trepidation and passed on the valet now threw open a door and ushered
me into the presence of his master

the room in which I found myself was very large and lofty the windows
were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black
oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within feeble gleams
of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes
and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects
around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles
of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling
dark draperies hung upon the walls the general furniture was profuse
comfortless antique and tattered many books and musical instruments
lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene i
felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and
irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all

upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at
full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in
it I at first thought of an overdone cordiality of the constrained
effort of the ennuyé man of the world a glance however at his
countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity we sat down and for
some moments while he spoke not I gazed upon him with a feeling half
of pity half of awe surely man had never before so terribly altered
in so brief a period as had roderick usher it was with difficulty that
I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me
with the companion of my early boyhood yet the character of his face
had been at all times remarkable a cadaverousness of complexion an eye
large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and
very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a
delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar
formations a finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominence
of a want of moral energy hair of a more than web-like softness and
tenuity these features with an inordinate expansion above the regions
of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be
forgotten and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character
of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay
so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke the now ghastly pallor
of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things
startled and even awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to
grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated
rather than fell about the face I could not even with effort connect
its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity

in the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence an
inconsistency and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble
and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy an excessive
nervous agitation for something of this nature I had indeed been
prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain
boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical
conformation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and
sullen his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the
animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic
concision that abrupt weighty unhurried and hollow-sounding
enunciation that leaden self-balanced and perfectly modulated
guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or the
irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense
excitement

it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest
desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him he
entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his
malady it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one
for which he despaired to find a remedy a mere nervous affection he
immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off it displayed
itself in a host of unnatural sensations some of these as he detailed
them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and
the general manner of the narration had their weight he suffered much
from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone
endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odors
of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint
light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed
instruments which did not inspire him with horror

to an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave I shall
perish said he I must perish in this deplorable folly thus thus
and not otherwise shall I be lost I dread the events of the future
not in themselves but in their results I shudder at the thought
of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this
intolerable agitation of soul I have indeed no abhorrence of danger
except in its absolute effect in terror in this unnerved in this
pitiable condition I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive
when I must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the
grim phantasm fear

I learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal
hints another singular feature of his mental condition he was
enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling
which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured
forth in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed
in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated an influence which some
peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had
by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spirit an effect
which the physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarn
into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the
morale of his existence

he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the
peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more
natural and far more palpable origin to the severe and long-continued
illness indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution of a tenderly
beloved sister his sole companion for long years his last and only
relative on earth her decease he said with a bitterness which I can
never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last
of the ancient race of the ushers while he spoke the lady madeline
for so was she called passed slowly through a remote portion of the
apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared i
regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread and
yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings a sensation of
stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps when a
door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and
eagerly the countenance of the brother but he had buried his face
in his hands and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary
wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many
passionate tears

the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her
physicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person
and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical
character were the unusual diagnosis hitherto she had steadily borne
up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself
finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival
at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with
inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer
and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus
probably be the last I should obtain that the lady at least while
living would be seen by me no more

for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or
myself and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to
alleviate the melancholy of my friend we painted and read together or
I listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking
guitar and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more
unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did
I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which
darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all
objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation
of gloom

I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus
spent alone with the master of the house of usher yet I should fail in
any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies
or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way an
excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over
all his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears among
other things I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and
amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber from the
paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch
by touch into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly
because I shuddered knowing not why from these paintings vivid as
their images now are before me I would in vain endeavor to educe more
than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely
written words by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs
he arrested and overawed attention if ever mortal painted an idea that
mortal was roderick usher for me at least in the circumstances then
surrounding me there arose out of the pure abstractions which the
hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass an intensity of
intolerable awe no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation
of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli

one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so
rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although
feebly in words a small picture presented the interior of an immensely
long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and
without interruption or device certain accessory points of the design
served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding
depth below the surface of the earth no outlet was observed in any
portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of
light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout
and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor

I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which
rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of
certain effects of stringed instruments it was perhaps the narrow
limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave
birth in great measure to the fantastic character of his performances
but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted
for they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the
words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself
with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental
collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded
as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial
excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily
remembered I was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as
he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i
fancied that I perceived and for the first time a full consciousness
on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her
throne the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very
nearly if not accurately thus

                         i
     in the greenest of our valleys
         by good angels tenanted
     once a fair and stately palace 
         radiant palace reared its head
     in the monarch thoughts dominion 
         it stood there
     never seraph spread a pinion
         over fabric half so fair
                         ii
     banners yellow glorious golden
         on its roof did float and flow
     this all this was in the olden
         time long ago
     and every gentle air that dallied
         in that sweet day
     along the ramparts plumed and pallid
         a winged odor went away
                         iii
     wanderers in that happy valley
         through two luminous windows saw
     spirits moving musically
         to a lutes well-tunéd law
     round about a throne where sitting
         porphyrogene
     in state his glory well befitting
         the ruler of the realm was seen
                          iv
     and all with pearl and ruby glowing
         was the fair palace door
     through which came flowing flowing flowing
         and sparkling evermore
     a troop of echoes whose sweet duty
         was but to sing
     in voices of surpassing beauty
         the wit and wisdom of their king
                         v
     but evil things in robes of sorrow
         assailed the monarchs high estate
     ah let us mourn for never morrow
         shall dawn upon him desolate
     and round about his home the glory
         that blushed and bloomed
     is but a dim-remembered story
         of the old time entombed
                         vi
     and travellers now within that valley
         through the red-litten windows see
     vast forms that move fantastically
         to a discordant melody
     while like a rapid ghastly river
         through the pale door
     a hideous throng rush out forever
         and laugh but smile no more

I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into
a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of ushers
which I mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men
 have thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which
he maintained it this opinion in its general form was that of the
sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the
idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain
conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization I lack words to express
the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion the belief
however was connected as I have previously hinted with the gray
stones of the home of his forefathers the conditions of the sentience
had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of
these stones in the order of their arrangement as well as in that of
the many fungI which overspread them and of the decayed trees which
stood around above all in the long undisturbed endurance of this
arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn
its evidence the evidence of the sentience was to be seen he
said and I here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain
condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the
walls the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet
importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the
destinies of his family and which made him what I now saw him what
he was such opinions need no comment and I will make none

our books the books which for years had formed no small portion of
the mental existence of the invalid were as might be supposed in
strict keeping with this character of phantasm we pored together over
such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset the belphegor of
machiavellI the heaven and hell of swedenborg the subterranean voyage
of nicholas klimm by holberg the chiromancy of robert flud of jean
dindaginé and of de la chambre the journey into the blue distance of
tieck and the city of the sun of campanella one favorite volume was
a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorium by the
dominican eymeric de gironne and there were passages in pomponius mela
about the old african satyrs and oegipans over which usher would sit
dreaming for hours his chief delight however was found in the perusal
of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothic the manual of
a forgotten church the vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiae
maguntinae

I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its
probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having
informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his
intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its
final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls
of the building the worldly reason however assigned for this singular
proceeding was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute the
brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration
of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain
obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the
remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family I will
not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the
person whom I met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at
the house I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a
harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution

at the request of usher I personally aided him in the arrangements for
the temporary entombment the body having been encoffined we two alone
bore it to its rest the vault in which we placed it and which had
been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive
atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small
damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great
depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my
own sleeping apartment it had been used apparently in remote feudal
times for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep and in later days as a
place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance
as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway
through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper the
door of massive iron had been also similarly protected its immense
weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its
hinges

having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of
horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin
and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking similitude between
the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher
divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which
I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that
sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between
them our glances however rested not long upon the dead for we could
not regard her unawed the disease which had thus entombed the lady in
the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly
cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and
the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is
so terrible in death we replaced and screwed down the lid and having
secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely
less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house

and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change
came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend his
ordinary manner had vanished his ordinary occupations were neglected or
forgotten he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and
objectless step the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible
a more ghastly hue but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone
out the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a
tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized
his utterance there were times indeed when I thought his unceasingly
agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret to divulge which
he struggled for the necessary courage at times again I was obliged
to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i
beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the
profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound it was
no wonder that his condition terrified that it infected me I felt
creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of
his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions

it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the
seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the
donjon that I experienced the full power of such feelings sleep came
not near my couch while the hours waned and waned away I struggled to
reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me I endeavored to
believe that much if not all of what I felt was due to the bewildering
influence of the gloomy furniture of the room of the dark and tattered
draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising
tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily
about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were fruitless an
irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length there
sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm shaking
this off with a gasp and a struggle I uplifted myself upon the pillows
and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber
harkened I know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted
me to certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses
of the storm at long intervals I knew not whence overpowered by an
intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable I threw on
my clothes with haste for I felt that I should sleep no more during the
night and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into
which I had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment

I had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an
adjoining staircase arrested my attention I presently recognised it as
that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle touch
at my door and entered bearing a lamp his countenance was as usual
cadaverously wan but moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in
his eyes an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor his
air appalled me but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had
so long endured and I even welcomed his presence as a relief

and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared about
him for some moments in silence you have not then seen it but stay
you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he
hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm

the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet
it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one
wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind had apparently
collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent
alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of
the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house
did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they
flew careering from all points against each other without passing
away into the distance I say that even their exceeding density did
not prevent our perceiving this yet we had no glimpse of the moon or
stars nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning but the
under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all
terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural
light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation
which hung about and enshrouded the mansion

you must not you shall not behold this said I shudderingly to
usher as I led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat
these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena
not uncommon or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in
the rank miasma of the tarn let us close this casement the air is
chilling and dangerous to your frame here is one of your favorite
romances I will read and you shall listen and so we will pass away
this terrible night together

the antique volume which I had taken up was the mad trist of sir
launcelot canning but I had called it a favorite of ushers more in sad
jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and
unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty
and spiritual ideality of my friend it was however the only book
immediately at hand and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement
which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history
of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness
of the folly which I should read could I have judged indeed by the
wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened or apparently
harkened to the words of the tale I might well have congratulated
myself upon the success of my design

I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where ethelred
the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission
into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by
force here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus

and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now
mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had
drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth
was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his
shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace
outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the
door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so
cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and
hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest

at the termination of this sentence I started and for a moment paused
for it appeared to me although I at once concluded that my excited
fancy had deceived me it appeared to me that from some very remote
portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears what might
have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled
and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which
sir launcelot had so particularly described it was beyond doubt
the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the
rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled
noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing
surely which should have interested or disturbed me I continued the
story

but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore
enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but
in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor and
of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with a
floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass
with this legend enwritten 

     who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin
     who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win

and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon
which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so
horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to
close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like
whereof was never before heard

here again I paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild
amazement for there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance
I did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i
found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh
protracted and most unusual screaming or grating sound the exact
counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragons
unnatural shriek as described by the romancer

oppressed as I certainly was upon the occurrence of this second and
most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations
in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant I still retained
sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the
sensitive nervousness of my companion I was by no means certain that
he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange
alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his
demeanor from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought
round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber
and thus I could but partially perceive his features although I saw
that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his head had
dropped upon his breast yet I knew that he was not asleep from the
wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile
the motion of his body too was at variance with this idea for he
rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway
having rapidly taken notice of all this I resumed the narrative of sir
launcelot which thus proceeded

and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the
dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up
of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of
the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement
of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth
tarried not for his full coming but feel down at his feet upon the
silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound

no sooner had these syllables passed my lips than as if a shield
of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of
silver I became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous
yet apparently muffled reverberation completely unnerved I leaped to
my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed i
rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent fixedly
before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony
rigidity but as I placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a
strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his
lips and I saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur
as if unconscious of my presence bending closely over him I at length
drank in the hideous import of his words

not hear it yes I hear it and have heard it
long long long many minutes many hours many days have I heard
it yet I dared not oh pity me miserable wretch that I am I dared
not I dared not speak we have put her living in the tomb said i
not that my senses were acute I now tell you that I heard her first
feeble movements in the hollow coffin I heard them many
many days ago yet I dared not I dared not speak and
now to-night ethelred ha ha the breaking of the hermits door
and the death-cry of the dragon and the clangor of the shield say
rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of
her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault
oh whither shall I fly will she not be here anon is she not hurrying
to upbraid me for my haste have I not heard her footstep on the stair
do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart
madman here he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his
syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soul madman
I tell you that she now stands without the door

as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found
the potency of a spell the huge antique pannels to which the speaker
pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony
jaws it was the work of the rushing gust but then without those doors
there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline
of usher there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some
bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame for a moment
she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold then
with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her
brother and in her violent and now final death-agonies bore him to the
floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated

from that chamber and from that mansion I fled aghast the storm
was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old
causeway suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and I turned
to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house
and its shadows were alone behind me the radiance was that of the full
setting and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once
barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending
from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the base while
I gazed this fissure rapidly widened there came a fierce breath of
the whirlwind the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my
sight my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder there
was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand
waters and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and
silently over the fragments of the house of usher




silence a fable

     alcman the mountain pinnacles slumber valleys crags and
     caves are silent

listen to me said the demon as he placed his hand upon my head the
region of which I speak is a dreary region in libya by the borders of
the river zaire and there is no quiet there nor silence

the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow
not onwards to the sea but palpitate forever and forever beneath the
red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion for many
miles on either side of the rivers oozy bed is a pale desert of
gigantic water-lilies they sigh one unto the other in that solitude
and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks and nod to
and fro their everlasting heads and there is an indistinct murmur which
cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water and
they sigh one unto the other

but there is a boundary to their realm the boundary of the dark
horrible lofty forest there like the waves about the hebrides the
low underwood is agitated continually but there is no wind throughout
the heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and
thither with a crashing and mighty sound and from their high summits
one by one drop everlasting dews and at the roots strange poisonous
flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber and overhead with a rustling
and loud noise the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they
roll a cataract over the fiery wall of the horizon but there is no
wind throughout the heaven and by the shores of the river zaire there
is neither quiet nor silence

it was night and the rain fell and falling it was rain but having
fallen it was blood and I stood in the morass among the tall and the
rain fell upon my head and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the
solemnity of their desolation

and all at once the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist and was
crimson in color and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood
by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon and
the rock was gray and ghastly and tall and the rock was gray upon
its front were characters engraven in the stone and I walked through
the morass of water-lilies until I came close unto the shore that i
might read the characters upon the stone but I could not decypher them
and I was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a
fuller red and I turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the
characters and the characters were desolation

and I looked upwards and there stood a man upon the summit of the
rock and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the
actions of the man and the man was tall and stately in form and was
wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome and
the outlines of his figure were indistinct but his features were the
features of a deity for the mantle of the night and of the mist and
of the moon and of the dew had left uncovered the features of his
face and his brow was lofty with thought and his eye wild with care
and in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow and
weariness and disgust with mankind and a longing after solitude

and the man sat upon the rock and leaned his head upon his hand and
looked out upon the desolation he looked down into the low unquiet
shrubbery and up into the tall primeval trees and up higher at the
rustling heaven and into the crimson moon and I lay close within
shelter of the lilies and observed the actions of the man and the
man trembled in the solitude but the night waned and he sat upon the
rock

and the man turned his attention from the heaven and looked out upon
the dreary river zaire and upon the yellow ghastly waters and upon the
pale legions of the water-lilies and the man listened to the sighs of
the water-lilies and to the murmur that came up from among them and i
lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the
man trembled in the solitude but the night waned and he sat upon the
rock

then I went down into the recesses of the morass and waded afar in
among the wilderness of the lilies and called unto the hippopotami
which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass and the
hippopotamI heard my call and came with the behemoth unto the foot
of the rock and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and I lay
close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man
trembled in the solitude but the night waned and he sat upon the rock

then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a frightful
tempest gathered in the heaven where before there had been no wind
and the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest and the
rain beat upon the head of the man and the floods of the river came
down and the river was tormented into foam and the water-lilies
shrieked within their beds and the forest crumbled before the wind and
the thunder rolled and the lightning fell and the rock rocked to its
foundation and I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of
the man and the man trembled in the solitude but the night waned and
he sat upon the rock

then I grew angry and cursed with the curse of silence the river
and the lilies and the wind and the forest and the heaven and the
thunder and the sighs of the water-lilies and they became accursed
and were still and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to
heaven and the thunder died away and the lightning did not flash and
the clouds hung motionless and the waters sunk to their level and
remained and the trees ceased to rock and the water-lilies sighed no
more and the murmur was heard no longer from among them nor any shadow
of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert and I looked upon the
characters of the rock and they were changed and the characters were
silence

and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man and his countenance
was wan with terror and hurriedly he raised his head from his hand
and stood forth upon the rock and listened but there was no voice
throughout the vast illimitable desert and the characters upon the rock
were silence and the man shuddered and turned his face away and fled
afar off in haste so that I beheld him no more

now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magI in the iron-bound
melancholy volumes of the magI therein I say are glorious histories
of the heaven and of the earth and of the mighty sea and of the genii
that over-ruled the sea and the earth and the lofty heaven there was
much lore too in the sayings which were said by the sybils and holy
holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around
dodona but as allah liveth that fable which the demon told me as
he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb I hold to be the most
wonderful of all and as the demon made an end of his story he fell
back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed and I could not laugh
with the demon and he cursed me because I could not laugh and the lynx
which dwelleth forever in the tomb came out therefrom and lay down at
the feet of the demon and looked at him steadily in the face




the masque of the red death

the red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had ever
been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its seal the
redness and the horror of blood there were sharp pains and sudden
dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution the
scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim
were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy
of his fellow-men and the whole seizure progress and termination of
the disease were the incidents of half an hour

but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his
dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand
hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of
his court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his
castellated abbeys this was an extensive and magnificent structure the
creation of the princes own eccentric yet august taste a strong and
lofty wall girdled it in this wall had gates of iron the courtiers
having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts
they resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden
impulses of despair or of frenzy from within the abbey was amply
provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to
contagion the external world could take care of itself in the meantime
it was folly to grieve or to think the prince had provided all the
appliances of pleasure there were buffoons there were improvisatori
there were ballet-dancers there were musicians there was beauty
there was wine all these and security were within without was the red
death

it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion
and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince
prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most
unusual magnificence

it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of the
rooms in which it was held there were seven an imperial suite in many
palaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while the
folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so that
the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded here the case was
very different as might have been expected from the dukes love of the
bizarre the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision
embraced but little more than one at a time there was a sharp turn at
every twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect to the
right and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothic
window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of
the suite these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in
accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber
into which it opened that at the eastern extremity was hung for
example in blue and vividly blue were its windows the second chamber
was purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were
purple the third was green throughout and so were the casements the
fourth was furnished and lighted with orange the fifth with white the
sixth with violet the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black
velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls
falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue but
in this chamber only the color of the windows failed to correspond with
the decorations the panes here were scarlet a deep blood color now in
no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amid
the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or
depended from the roof there was no light of any kind emanating from
lamp or candle within the suite of chambers but in the corridors
that followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavy
tripod bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the
tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced
a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances but in the western or
black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark
hangings through the blood-tinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and
produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered
that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its
precincts at all

it was in this apartment also that there stood against the western
wall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a
dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minute-hand made the circuit
of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from the
brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and
exceedingly musical but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that at
each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were constrained
to pause momentarily in their performance to hearken to the sound
and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was a
brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the chimes of the
clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and the
more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in
confused reverie or meditation but when the echoes had fully ceased
a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked at
each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and made
whispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clock
should produce in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse of
sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of
the time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clock
and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as
before

but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel
the tastes of the duke were peculiar he had a fine eye for colors and
effects he disregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were bold
and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there are
some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that he was not
it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was
not

he had directed in great part the moveable embellishments of the seven
chambers upon occasion of this great fete and it was his own guiding
taste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure they
were grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and
phantasm much of what has been since seen in hernanI there were
arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were
delirious fancies such as the madman fashions there was much of the
beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the
terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust
to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of
dreams and these the dreams writhed in and about taking hue from the
rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo
of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in
the hall of the velvet and then for a moment all is still and all is
silent save the voice of the clock the dreams are stiff-frozen as they
stand but the echoes of the chime die away they have endured but an
instant and a light half-subdued laughter floats after them as they
depart and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe
to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the many-tinted
windows through which stream the rays from the tripods but to the
chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of
the maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there flows a
ruddier light through the blood-colored panes and the blackness of the
sable drapery appals and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet
there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly
emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more
remote gaieties of the other apartments

but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat
feverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until at
length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and then
the music ceased as I have told and the evolutions of the waltzers
were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before
but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the
clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept with
more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who
revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that before the last
echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many
individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the
presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no
single individual before and the rumor of this new presence having
spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the
whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and
surprise then finally of terror of horror and of disgust

in an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted it may well be
supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation
in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited but
the figure in question had out-heroded herod and gone beyond the bounds
of even the princes indefinite decorum there are chords in the hearts
of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion even with
the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests there are
matters of which no jest can be made the whole company indeed seemed
now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger
neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall and gaunt and
shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave the
mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the
countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have
had difficulty in detecting the cheat and yet all this might have been
endured if not approved by the mad revellers around but the mummer
had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death his vesture was
dabbled in blood and his broad brow with all the features of the face
was besprinkled with the scarlet horror

when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which
with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its role
stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed in
the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste
but in the next his brow reddened with rage

who dares he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near
him who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him and
unmask him that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the
battlements

it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero
as he uttered these words they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly
and clearly for the prince was a bold and robust man and the music had
become hushed at the waving of his hand

it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale
courtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a slight rushing
movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at the
moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately step
made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain nameless awe
with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole
party there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so that
unimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes person and while
the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of
the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the
same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the
first through the blue chamber to the purple through the purple to
the green through the green to the orange through this again to the
white and even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been
made to arrest him it was then however that the prince prospero
maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushed
hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on account
of a deadly terror that had seized upon all he bore aloft a drawn
dagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three or
four feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained the
extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted his
pursuer there was a sharp cry and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the
sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate in death
the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage of despair
a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black
apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and
motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable
horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they
handled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form

and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death he had come
like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the
blood-bedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing
posture of his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with
that of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired and
darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all




the cask of amontillado

the thousand injuries of fortunato I had borne as I best could but
when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge you who so well know the
nature of my soul will not suppose however that I gave utterance to
a threat at length I would be avenged this was a point definitively
settled but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved
precluded the idea of risk I must not only punish but punish with
impunity a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its
redresser it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make
himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong

it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given
fortunato cause to doubt my good will I continued as was my wont to
smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at
the thought of his immolation

he had a weak point this fortunato although in other regards he was
a man to be respected and even feared he prided himself on his
connoisseurship in wine few italians have the true virtuoso spirit
for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and
opportunity to practise imposture upon the british and austrian
millionaires in painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen
was a quack but in the matter of old wines he was sincere in this
respect I did not differ from him materially I was skilful in the
italian vintages myself and bought largely whenever I could

it was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the
carnival season that I encountered my friend he accosted me with
excessive warmth for he had been drinking much the man wore motley he
had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress and his head was surmounted
by the conical cap and bells I was so pleased to see him that i
thought I should never have done wringing his hand

I said to him my dear fortunato you are luckily met how remarkably
well you are looking to-day but I have received a pipe of what passes
for amontillado and I have my doubts

how said he amontillado a pipe impossible and in the middle of
the carnival

I have my doubts I replied and I was silly enough to pay the full
amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to
be found and I was fearful of losing a bargain

amontillado

I have my doubts

amontillado

and I must satisfy them

amontillado

as you are engaged I am on my way to luchesI if any one has a
critical turn it is he he will tell me 

luchesI cannot tell amontillado from sherry

and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your
own

come let us go

whither

to your vaults

my friend no I will not impose upon your good nature I perceive you
have an engagement luchesI 

I have no engagement come

my friend no it is not the engagement but the severe cold with which
I perceive you are afflicted the vaults are insufferably damp they are
encrusted with nitre

let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing amontillado you
have been imposed upon and as for luchesI he cannot distinguish sherry
from amontillado

thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on a mask
of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person i
suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo

there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in
honor of the time I had told them that I should not return until the
morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house
these orders were sufficient I well knew to insure their immediate
disappearance one and all as soon as my back was turned

I took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to fortunato
bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into
the vaults I passed down a long and winding staircase requesting him
to be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the
descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the
montresors

the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled
as he strode

the pipe said he

it is farther on said I but observe the white web-work which gleams
from these cavern walls

he turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that
distilled the rheum of intoxication

nitre he asked at length

nitre I replied how long have you had that cough

ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh
ugh ugh

my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes

it is nothing he said at last

come I said with decision we will go back your health is
precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as
once I was you are a man to be missed for me it is no matter we will
go back you will be ill and I cannot be responsible besides there is
luchesI 

enough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill me i
shall not die of a cough

true true I replied and indeed I had no intention of alarming
you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution a draught of
this medoc will defend us from the damps

here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of
its fellows that lay upon the mould

drink I said presenting him the wine

he raised it to his lips with a leer he paused and nodded to me
familiarly while his bells jingled

I drink he said to the buried that repose around us

and I to your long life

he again took my arm and we proceeded

these vaults he said are extensive

the montresors I replied were a great and numerous family

I forget your arms

a huge human foot dor in a field azure the foot crushes a serpent
rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel

and the motto

nemo me impune lacessit

good he said

the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled my own fancy grew
warm with the medoc we had passed through walls of piled bones with
casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of the
catacombs I paused again and this time I made bold to seize fortunato
by an arm above the elbow

the nitre I said see it increases it hangs like moss upon the
vaults we are below the rivers bed the drops of moisture trickle
among the bones come we will go back ere it is too late your cough 

it is nothing he said let us go on but first another draught of
the medoc

I broke and reached him a flagon of de grâve he emptied it at a breath
his eyes flashed with a fierce light he laughed and threw the bottle
upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand

I looked at him in surprise he repeated the movement a grotesque one

you do not comprehend he said

not I I replied

then you are not of the brotherhood

how

you are not of the masons

yes yes I said yes yes

you impossible a mason

a mason I replied

a sign he said

it is this I answered producing a trowel from beneath the folds of
my roquelaire

you jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces but let us proceed to
the amontillado

be it so I said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again
offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we continued our route
in search of the amontillado we passed through a range of low arches
descended passed on and descending again arrived at a deep crypt in
which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than
flame

at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less
spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the
vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris three
sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner from
the fourth the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon
the earth forming at one point a mound of some size within the wall
thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still
interior recess in depth about four feet in width three in height
six or seven it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use
in itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal
supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of their
circumscribing walls of solid granite

it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavored to
pry into the depths of the recess its termination the feeble light did
not enable us to see

proceed I said herein is the amontillado as for luchesI 

he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped unsteadily
forward while I followed immediately at his heels in an instant he had
reached the extremity of the niche and finding his progress arrested
by the rock stood stupidly bewildered a moment more and I had fettered
him to the granite in its surface were two iron staples distant from
each other about two feet horizontally from one of these depended
a short chain from the other a padlock throwing the links about his
waist it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it he was too
much astounded to resist withdrawing the key I stepped back from the
recess

pass your hand I said over the wall you cannot help feeling the
nitre indeed it is very damp once more let me implore you to
return no then I must positively leave you but I must first render
you all the little attentions in my power

the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his
astonishment

true I replied the amontillado

as I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which i
have before spoken throwing them aside I soon uncovered a quantity of
building stone and mortar with these materials and with the aid of my
trowel I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche

I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered
that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off the
earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth
of the recess it was not the cry of a drunken man there was then a
long and obstinate silence I laid the second tier and the third and
the fourth and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain the
noise lasted for several minutes during which that I might hearken to
it with the more satisfaction I ceased my labors and sat down upon the
bones when at last the clanking subsided I resumed the trowel and
finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh
tier the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast I again
paused and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work threw a few
feeble rays upon the figure within

a succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the
throat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently back for a
brief moment I hesitated I trembled unsheathing my rapier I began to
grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant reassured
me I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs and felt
satisfied I reapproached the wall I replied to the yells of him
who clamored I re-echoed I aided I surpassed them in volume and in
strength I did this and the clamorer grew still

it was now midnight and my task was drawing to a close I had completed
the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier I had finished a portion
of the last and the eleventh there remained but a single stone to
be fitted and plastered in I struggled with its weight I placed it
partially in its destined position but now there came from out the
niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head it was succeeded
by a sad voice which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the
noble fortunato the voice said 

ha ha ha he he a very good joke indeed an excellent jest we
will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo he he he over
our wine he he he

the amontillado I said

he he he he he he yes the amontillado but is it not getting
late will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato
and the rest let us be gone

yes I said let us be gone

for the love of god montressor

yes I said for the love of god

but to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply I grew impatient i
called aloud 

fortunato

no answer I called again 

fortunato

no answer still I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let
it fall within there came forth in return only a jingling of the bells
my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs i
hastened to make an end of my labor I forced the last stone into its
position I plastered it up against the new masonry I re-erected the
old rampart of bones for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed
them in pace requiescat




the imp of the perverse

in the consideration of the faculties and impulses of the prima mobilia
of the human soul the phrenologists have failed to make room for a
propensity which although obviously existing as a radical primitive
irreducible sentiment has been equally overlooked by all the moralists
who have preceded them in the pure arrogance of the reason we have
all overlooked it we have suffered its existence to escape our senses
solely through want of belief of faith whether it be faith in
revelation or faith in the kabbala the idea of it has never occurred
to us simply because of its supererogation we saw no need of the
impulse for the propensity we could not perceive its necessity we
could not understand that is to say we could not have understood had
the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself we could not
have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects
of humanity either temporal or eternal it cannot be denied that
phrenology and in great measure all metaphysicianism have been
concocted a priorI the intellectual or logical man rather than the
understanding or observant man set himself to imagine designs to
dictate purposes to god having thus fathomed to his satisfaction the
intentions of jehovah out of these intentions he built his innumerable
systems of mind in the matter of phrenology for example we first
determined naturally enough that it was the design of the deity that
man should eat we then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness
and this organ is the scourge with which the deity compels man will-i
nill-I into eating secondly having settled it to be gods will that
man should continue his species we discovered an organ of amativeness
forthwith and so with combativeness with ideality with causality
with constructiveness so in short with every organ whether
representing a propensity a moral sentiment or a faculty of the pure
intellect and in these arrangements of the principia of human action
the spurzheimites whether right or wrong in part or upon the whole
have but followed in principle the footsteps of their predecessors
deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of
man and upon the ground of the objects of his creator

it would have been wiser it would have been safer to classify if
classify we must upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally
did and was always occasionally doing rather than upon the basis of
what we took it for granted the deity intended him to do if we cannot
comprehend god in his visible works how then in his inconceivable
thoughts that call the works into being if we cannot understand him in
his objective creatures how then in his substantive moods and phases of
creation

induction a posteriorI would have brought phrenology to admit as an
innate and primitive principle of human action a paradoxical something
which we may call perverseness for want of a more characteristic term
in the sense I intend it is in fact a mobile without motive a motive
not motivirt through its promptings we act without comprehensible
object or if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms we
may so far modify the proposition as to say that through its promptings
we act for the reason that we should not in theory no reason can be
more unreasonable but in fact there is none more strong with certain
minds under certain conditions it becomes absolutely irresistible i
am not more certain that I breathe than that the assurance of the wrong
or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels
us and alone impels us to its prosecution nor will this overwhelming
tendency to do wrong for the wrongs sake admit of analysis or
resolution into ulterior elements it is a radical a primitive
impulse-elementary it will be said I am aware that when we persist in
acts because we feel we should not persist in them our conduct is but a
modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness
of phrenology but a glance will show the fallacy of this idea the
phrenological combativeness has for its essence the necessity of
self-defence it is our safeguard against injury its principle regards
our well-being and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously
with its development it follows that the desire to be well must
be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a
modification of combativeness but in the case of that something which i
term perverseness the desire to be well is not only not aroused but a
strongly antagonistical sentiment exists

an appeal to ones own heart is after all the best reply to the
sophistry just noticed no one who trustingly consults and thoroughly
questions his own soul will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness
of the propensity in question it is not more incomprehensible than
distinctive there lives no man who at some period has not been
tormented for example by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by
circumlocution the speaker is aware that he displeases he has every
intention to please he is usually curt precise and clear the most
laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his
tongue it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving
it flow he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses
yet the thought strikes him that by certain involutions and
parentheses this anger may be engendered that single thought is enough
the impulse increases to a wish the wish to a desire the desire to
an uncontrollable longing and the longing to the deep regret and
mortification of the speaker and in defiance of all consequences is
indulged

we have a task before us which must be speedily performed we know that
it will be ruinous to make delay the most important crisis of our life
calls trumpet-tongued for immediate energy and action we glow we are
consumed with eagerness to commence the work with the anticipation of
whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire it must it shall be
undertaken to-day and yet we put it off until to-morrow and why
there is no answer except that we feel perverse using the word with
no comprehension of the principle to-morrow arrives and with it a more
impatient anxiety to do our duty but with this very increase of anxiety
arrives also a nameless a positively fearful because unfathomable
craving for delay this craving gathers strength as the moments fly
the last hour for action is at hand we tremble with the violence of
the conflict within us of the definite with the indefinite of the
substance with the shadow but if the contest have proceeded thus
far it is the shadow which prevails we struggle in vain the clock
strikes and is the knell of our welfare at the same time it is
the chanticleer note to the ghost that has so long overawed us it
flies it disappears we are free the old energy returns we will labor
now alas it is too late

we stand upon the brink of a precipice we peer into the abyss we
grow sick and dizzy our first impulse is to shrink from the danger
unaccountably we remain by slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and
horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling by gradations
still more imperceptible this cloud assumes shape as did the vapor
from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the arabian nights
but out of this our cloud upon the precipices edge there grows into
palpability a shape far more terrible than any genius or any demon
of a tale and yet it is but a thought although a fearful one and one
which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the
delight of its horror it is merely the idea of what would be our
sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a
height and this fall this rushing annihilation for the very reason
that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most
ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever
presented themselves to our imagination for this very cause do we now
the most vividly desire it and because our reason violently deters us
from the brink therefore do we the most impetuously approach it there
is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient as that of him who
shuddering upon the edge of a precipice thus meditates a plunge to
indulge for a moment in any attempt at thought is to be inevitably
lost for reflection but urges us to forbear and therefore it is i
say that we cannot if there be no friendly arm to check us or if we
fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss
we plunge and are destroyed

examine these similar actions as we will we shall find them resulting
solely from the spirit of the perverse we perpetrate them because we
feel that we should not beyond or behind this there is no intelligible
principle and we might indeed deem this perverseness a direct
instigation of the arch-fiend were it not occasionally known to operate
in furtherance of good

I have said thus much that in some measure I may answer your question
that I may explain to you why I am here that I may assign to you
something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my
wearing these fetters and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned
had I not been thus prolix you might either have misunderstood me
altogether or with the rabble have fancied me mad as it is you will
easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the imp
of the perverse

it is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more
thorough deliberation for weeks for months I pondered upon the
means of the murder I rejected a thousand schemes because their
accomplishment involved a chance of detection at length in reading
some french memoirs I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that
occurred to madame pilau through the agency of a candle accidentally
poisoned the idea struck my fancy at once I knew my victims habit
of reading in bed I knew too that his apartment was narrow and
ill-ventilated but I need not vex you with impertinent details I need
not describe the easy artifices by which I substituted in his bed-room
candle-stand a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there
found the next morning he was discovered dead in his bed and the
coroners verdict was death by the visitation of god

having inherited his estate all went well with me for years the idea
of detection never once entered my brain of the remains of the fatal
taper I had myself carefully disposed I had left no shadow of a clew
by which it would be possible to convict or even to suspect me of the
crime it is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose
in my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security for a very long
period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment it afforded
me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from
my sin but there arrived at length an epoch from which the pleasurable
feeling grew by scarcely perceptible gradations into a haunting and
harassing thought it harassed because it haunted I could scarcely get
rid of it for an instant it is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed
with the ringing in our ears or rather in our memories of the burthen
of some ordinary song or some unimpressive snatches from an opera
nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good or
the opera air meritorious in this manner at last I would perpetually
catch myself pondering upon my security and repeating in a low
undertone the phrase I am safe

one day whilst sauntering along the streets I arrested myself in the
act of murmuring half aloud these customary syllables in a fit of
petulance I remodelled them thus I am safe I am safe yes if I be
not fool enough to make open confession

no sooner had I spoken these words than I felt an icy chill creep to
my heart I had had some experience in these fits of perversity whose
nature I have been at some trouble to explain and I remembered well
that in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks and now
my own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to
confess the murder of which I had been guilty confronted me as if the
very ghost of him whom I had murdered and beckoned me on to death

at first I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul
I walked vigorously faster still faster at length I ran I felt
a maddening desire to shriek aloud every succeeding wave of thought
overwhelmed me with new terror for alas I well too well understood
that to think in my situation was to be lost I still quickened my
pace I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares at
length the populace took the alarm and pursued me I felt then the
consummation of my fate could I have torn out my tongue I would have
done it but a rough voice resounded in my ears a rougher grasp seized
me by the shoulder I turned I gasped for breath for a moment i
experienced all the pangs of suffocation I became blind and deaf
and giddy and then some invisible fiend I thought struck me with his
broad palm upon the back the long imprisoned secret burst forth from my
soul

they say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation but with marked
emphasis and passionate hurry as if in dread of interruption before
concluding the brief but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the
hangman and to hell

having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial
conviction I fell prostrate in a swoon

but why shall I say more to-day I wear these chains and am here
to-morrow I shall be fetterless but where




the island of the fay

     nullus enim locus sine genio est servius

la musique says marmontel in those contes moraux  which in all
our translations we have insisted upon calling moral tales as if
in mockery of their spirit la musique est le seul des talents qui
jouissent de lui-meme tous les autres veulent des temoins he here
confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity
for creating them no more than any other talent is that for music
susceptible of complete enjoyment where there is no second party to
appreciate its exercise and it is only in common with other talents
that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude the
idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly or
has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point is
doubtless the very tenable one that the higher order of music is
the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone the
proposition in this form will be admitted at once by those who love
the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual uses but there is one
pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only
one which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment
of seclusion I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of
natural scenery in truth the man who would behold aright the glory of
god upon earth must in solitude behold that glory to me at least the
presence not of human life only but of life in any other form than
that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless is
a stain upon the landscape is at war with the genius of the scene i
love indeed to regard the dark valleys and the gray rocks and
the waters that silently smile and the forests that sigh in uneasy
slumbers and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all i
love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast
animate and sentient whole a whole whose form that of the sphere
is the most perfect and most inclusive of all whose path is among
associate planets whose meek handmaiden is the moon whose mediate
sovereign is the sun whose life is eternity whose thought is that of
a god whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies are lost in
immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance
of the animalculae which infest the brain a being which we in
consequence regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same
manner as these animalculae must thus regard us

our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on
every hand notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the
priesthood that space and therefore that bulk is an important
consideration in the eyes of the almighty the cycles in which the stars
move are those best adapted for the evolution without collision of
the greatest possible number of bodies the forms of those bodies are
accurately such as within a given surface to include the greatest
possible amount of matter while the surfaces themselves are
so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be
accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged nor is it any
argument against bulk being an object with god that space itself is
infinite for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it and
since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a
principle indeed as far as our judgments extend the leading principle
in the operations of deity it is scarcely logical to imagine it
confined to the regions of the minute where we daily trace it and not
extending to those of the august as we find cycle within cycle without
end yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the
god-head may we not analogically suppose in the same manner life
within life the less within the greater and all within the spirit
divine in short we are madly erring through self-esteem in believing
man in either his temporal or future destinies to be of more moment
in the universe than that vast clod of the valley which he tills and
contemns and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than
that he does not behold it in operation 

these fancies and such as these have always given to my meditations
among the mountains and the forests by the rivers and the ocean a
tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic my
wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching and often
solitary and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim
deep valley or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake
has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed
and gazed alone what flippant frenchman was it who said in allusion
to the well-known work of zimmerman that la solitude est une belle
chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitude est une
belle chose the epigram cannot be gainsayed but the necessity is a
thing that does not exist

it was during one of my lonely journeyings amid a far distant region
of mountain locked within mountain and sad rivers and melancholy tarn
writhing or sleeping within all that I chanced upon a certain rivulet
and island I came upon them suddenly in the leafy june and threw
myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub
that I might doze as I contemplated the scene I felt that thus only
should I look upon it such was the character of phantasm which it wore

on all sides save to the west where the sun was about sinking arose
the verdant walls of the forest the little river which turned sharply
in its course and was thus immediately lost to sight seemed to have
no exit from its prison but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of
the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter so it appeared to
me as I lay at length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly
and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall
from the sunset fountains of the sky

about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in one
small circular island profusely verdured reposed upon the bosom of the
stream

so blended bank and shadow there

that each seemed pendulous in air so mirror-like was the glassy water
that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the
emerald turf its crystal dominion began

my position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and
western extremities of the islet and I observed a singularly-marked
difference in their aspects the latter was all one radiant harem of
garden beauties it glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant
sunlight and fairly laughed with flowers the grass was short
springy sweet-scented and asphodel-interspersed the trees were lithe
mirthful erect bright slender and graceful of eastern figure and
foliage with bark smooth glossy and parti-colored there seemed a
deep sense of life and joy about all and although no airs blew from out
the heavens yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to
and fro of innumerable butterflies that might have been mistaken for
tulips with wings 

the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade
a sombre yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things the
trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude wreathing
themselves into sad solemn and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of
mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wore the deep tint of the
cypress and the heads of its blades hung droopingly and hither and
thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks low and narrow
and not very long that had the aspect of graves but were not although
over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered the shade
of the trees fell heavily upon the water and seemed to bury itself
therein impregnating the depths of the element with darkness I fancied
that each shadow as the sun descended lower and lower separated itself
sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth and thus became absorbed by
the stream while other shadows issued momently from the trees taking
the place of their predecessors thus entombed

this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it and i
lost myself forthwith in revery if ever island were enchanted said
I to myself this is it this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who
remain from the wreck of the race are these green tombs theirs or do
they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own in dying
do they not rather waste away mournfully rendering unto god little by
little their existence as these trees render up shadow after shadow
exhausting their substance unto dissolution what the wasting tree is to
the water that imbibes its shade growing thus blacker by what it preys
upon may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it

as I thus mused with half-shut eyes while the sun sank rapidly to
rest and eddying currents careered round and round the island bearing
upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the
sycamore-flakes which in their multiform positions upon the water a
quick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased while
I thus mused it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays
about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness
from out the light at the western end of the island she stood erect
in a singularly fragile canoe and urged it with the mere phantom of an
oar while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams her attitude
seemed indicative of joy but sorrow deformed it as she passed within
the shade slowly she glided along and at length rounded the islet and
re-entered the region of light the revolution which has just been made
by the fay continued I musingly is the cycle of the brief year of
her life she has floated through her winter and through her summer she
is a year nearer unto death for I did not fail to see that as she came
into the shade her shadow fell from her and was swallowed up in the
dark water making its blackness more black

and again the boat appeared and the fay but about the attitude of the
latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy
she floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened
momently and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water and
became absorbed into its blackness and again and again she made the
circuit of the island while the sun rushed down to his slumbers and
at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person
while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct and at each
passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade which became
whelmed in a shadow more black but at length when the sun had
utterly departed the fay now the mere ghost of her former self went
disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood and
that she issued thence at all I cannot say for darkness fell over all
things and I beheld her magical figure no more




the assignation

     stay for me there   I will not fail
     to meet thee in that hollow vale

     exequy on the death of his wife by henry king
      bishop of chichester

ill-fated and mysterious man bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own
imagination and fallen in the flames of thine own youth again in fancy
I behold thee once more thy form hath risen before me not oh not
as thou art in the cold valley and shadow but as thou shouldst
be squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of
dim visions thine own venice which is a star-beloved elysium of the
sea and the wide windows of whose palladian palaces look down with a
deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters yes i
repeat it as thou shouldst be there are surely other worlds
than this other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude other
speculations than the speculations of the sophist who then shall call
thy conduct into question who blame thee for thy visionary hours or
denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life which were but the
overflowings of thine everlasting energies

it was at venice beneath the covered archway there called the ponte di
sospirI that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom
I speak it is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind
the circumstances of that meeting yet I remember ah how should i
forget the deep midnight the bridge of sighs the beauty of woman
and the genius of romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal

it was a night of unusual gloom the great clock of the piazza had
sounded the fifth hour of the italian evening the square of the
campanile lay silent and deserted and the lights in the old ducal
palace were dying fast away I was returning home from the piazetta by
way of the grand canal but as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth
of the canal san marco a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly
upon the night in one wild hysterical and long continued shriek
startled at the sound I sprang upon my feet while the gondolier
letting slip his single oar lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a
chance of recovery and we were consequently left to the guidance of the
current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel
like some huge and sable-feathered condor we were slowly drifting down
towards the bridge of sighs when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the
windows and down the staircases of the ducal palace turned all at once
that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day

a child slipping from the arms of its own mother had fallen from an
upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal the
quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim and although my own
gondola was the only one in sight many a stout swimmer already in the
stream was seeking in vain upon the surface the treasure which was
to be found alas only within the abyss upon the broad black marble
flagstones at the entrance of the palace and a few steps above the
water stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since
forgotten it was the marchesa aphrodite the adoration of all
venice the gayest of the gay the most lovely where all were
beautiful but still the young wife of the old and intriguing mentoni
and the mother of that fair child her first and only one who now deep
beneath the murky water was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her
sweet caresses and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon
her name

she stood alone her small bare and silvery feet gleamed in the
black mirror of marble beneath her her hair not as yet more than
half loosened for the night from its ball-room array clustered amid
a shower of diamonds round and round her classical head in curls like
those of the young hyacinth a snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed
to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form but the mid-summer
and midnight air was hot sullen and still and no motion in the
statue-like form itself stirred even the folds of that raiment of very
vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the niobe
yet strange to say her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards
upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried but riveted in a
widely different direction the prison of the old republic is I think
the stateliest building in all venice but how could that lady gaze so
fixedly upon it when beneath her lay stifling her only child yon dark
gloomy niche too yawns right opposite her chamber window what
then could there be in its shadows in its architecture in its
ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices that the marchesa dI mentonI had not
wondered at a thousand times before nonsense who does not remember
that at such a time as this the eye like a shattered mirror
multiplies the images of its sorrow and sees in innumerable far-off
places the woe which is close at hand

many steps above the marchesa and within the arch of the water-gate
stood in full dress the satyr-like figure of mentonI himself he was
occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar and seemed ennuye to the
very death as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his
child stupified and aghast I had myself no power to move from the
upright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek and must
have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous
appearance as with pale countenance and rigid limbs I floated down
among them in that funereal gondola

all efforts proved in vain many of the most energetic in the search
were relaxing their exertions and yielding to a gloomy sorrow there
seemed but little hope for the child how much less than for the
mother but now from the interior of that dark niche which has been
already mentioned as forming a part of the old republican prison and
as fronting the lattice of the marchesa a figure muffled in a cloak
stepped out within reach of the light and pausing a moment upon the
verge of the giddy descent plunged headlong into the canal as in an
instant afterwards he stood with the still living and breathing
child within his grasp upon the marble flagstones by the side of the
marchesa his cloak heavy with the drenching water became unfastened
and falling in folds about his feet discovered to the wonder-stricken
spectators the graceful person of a very young man with the sound of
whose name the greater part of europe was then ringing

no word spoke the deliverer but the marchesa she will now receive
her child she will press it to her heart she will cling to its little
form and smother it with her caresses alas anothers arms have
taken it from the stranger anothers arms have taken it away and
borne it afar off unnoticed into the palace and the marchesa her
lip her beautiful lip trembles tears are gathering in her eyes those
eyes which like plinys acanthus are soft and almost liquid yes
tears are gathering in those eyes and see the entire woman thrills
throughout the soul and the statue has started into life the pallor
of the marble countenance the swelling of the marble bosom the very
purity of the marble feet we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide
of ungovernable crimson and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate
frame as a gentle air at napolI about the rich silver lilies in the
grass

why should that lady blush to this demand there is no answer except
that having left in the eager haste and terror of a mothers heart
the privacy of her own boudoir she has neglected to enthral her tiny
feet in their slippers and utterly forgotten to throw over her venetian
shoulders that drapery which is their due what other possible reason
could there have been for her so blushing for the glance of those wild
appealing eyes for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom for the
convulsive pressure of that trembling hand that hand which fell
as mentonI turned into the palace accidentally upon the hand of the
stranger what reason could there have been for the low the singularly
low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in
bidding him adieu thou hast conquered she said or the murmurs of
the water deceived me thou hast conquered one hour after sunrise we
shall meet so let it be

    

the tumult had subsided the lights had died away within the palace
and the stranger whom I now recognized stood alone upon the flags he
shook with inconceivable agitation and his eye glanced around in search
of a gondola I could not do less than offer him the service of my own
and he accepted the civility having obtained an oar at the water-gate
we proceeded together to his residence while he rapidly recovered his
self-possession and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of
great apparent cordiality

there are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute the
person of the stranger let me call him by this title who to all the
world was still a stranger the person of the stranger is one of these
subjects in height he might have been below rather than above the
medium size although there were moments of intense passion when his
frame actually expanded and belied the assertion the light almost
slender symmetry of his figure promised more of that ready activity
which he evinced at the bridge of sighs than of that herculean strength
which he has been known to wield without an effort upon occasions of
more dangerous emergency with the mouth and chin of a deity singular
wild full liquid eyes whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense
and brilliant jet and a profusion of curling black hair from which
a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and
ivory his were features than which I have seen none more classically
regular except perhaps the marble ones of the emperor commodus yet
his countenance was nevertheless one of those which all men have seen
at some period of their lives and have never afterwards seen again it
had no peculiar it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened
upon the memory a countenance seen and instantly forgotten but
forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind
not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed at any time to
throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face but that
the mirror mirror-like retained no vestige of the passion when the
passion had departed

upon leaving him on the night of our adventure he solicited me in
what I thought an urgent manner to call upon him very early the
next morning shortly after sunrise I found myself accordingly at his
palazzo one of those huge structures of gloomy yet fantastic pomp
which tower above the waters of the grand canal in the vicinity of the
rialto I was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics into an
apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door
with an actual glare making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness

I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy report had spoken of his
possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of
ridiculous exaggeration but as I gazed about me I could not bring
myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in europe could have
supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around

although as I say the sun had arisen yet the room was still
brilliantly lighted up I judge from this circumstance as well as from
an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend that he had
not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night in the
architecture and embellishments of the chamber the evident design
had been to dazzle and astound little attention had been paid to the
decora of what is technically called keeping or to the proprieties
of nationality the eye wandered from object to object and rested upon
none neither the grotesques of the greek painters nor the sculptures
of the best italian days nor the huge carvings of untutored egypt rich
draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low
melancholy music whose origin was not to be discovered the senses were
oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes reeking up from strange
convolute censers together with multitudinous flaring and flickering
tongues of emerald and violet fire the rays of the newly risen sun
poured in upon the whole through windows formed each of a single pane
of crimson-tinted glass glancing to and fro in a thousand reflections
from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten
silver the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the
artificial light and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of
rich liquid-looking cloth of chilI gold

ha ha ha ha ha ha laughed the proprietor motioning me to
a seat as I entered the room and throwing himself back at full-length
upon an ottoman I see said he perceiving that I could not
immediately reconcile myself to the bienseance of so singular a
welcome I see you are astonished at my apartment at my statues my
pictures my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery
absolutely drunk eh with my magnificence but pardon me my dear
sir here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality
pardon me for my uncharitable laughter you appeared so utterly
astonished besides some things are so completely ludicrous that a man
must laugh or die to die laughing must be the most glorious of
all glorious deaths sir thomas more a very fine man was sir thomas
more sir thomas more died laughing you remember also in the
absurdities of ravisius textor there is a long list of characters who
came to the same magnificent end do you know however continued he
musingly that at sparta which is now palæ ochorI at sparta I say
to the west of the citadel among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins is
a kind of socle upon which are still legible the letters aaem they
are undoubtedly part of peaaema now at sparta were a thousand temples
and shrines to a thousand different divinities how exceedingly strange
that the altar of laughter should have survived all the others but in
the present instance he resumed with a singular alteration of voice
and manner I have no right to be merry at your expense you might well
have been amazed europe cannot produce anything so fine as this my
little regal cabinet my other apartments are by no means of the same
order mere ultras of fashionable insipidity this is better than
fashion is it not yet this has but to be seen to become the rage that
is with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire
patrimony I have guarded however against any such profanation
with one exception you are the only human being besides myself and my
valet who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial
precincts since they have been bedizzened as you see

I bowed in acknowledgment for the overpowering sense of splendor and
perfume and music together with the unexpected eccentricity of
his address and manner prevented me from expressing in words my
appreciation of what I might have construed into a compliment

here he resumed arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around
the apartment here are paintings from the greeks to cimabue and from
cimabue to the present hour many are chosen as you see with little
deference to the opinions of virtu they are all however fitting
tapestry for a chamber such as this here too are some chefs
doeuvre of the unknown great and here unfinished designs by men
celebrated in their day whose very names the perspicacity of the
academies has left to silence and to me what think you said he
turning abruptly as he spoke what think you of this madonna della
pieta

it is guidos own I said with all the enthusiasm of my nature for i
had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness it is guidos
own how could you have obtained it she is undoubtedly in painting
what the venus is in sculpture

ha said he thoughtfully the venus the beautiful venus the venus
of the medicI she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair part of
the left arm here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty
and all the right are restorations and in the coquetry of that right
arm lies I think the quintessence of all affectation give me the
canova the apollo too is a copy there can be no doubt of it blind
fool that I am who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the apollo
I cannot help pity me I cannot help preferring the antinous was it
not socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of
marble then michael angelo was by no means original in his couplet 

     non ha lottimo artista alcun concetto
     che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva

it has been or should be remarked that in the manner of the true
gentleman we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the
vulgar without being at once precisely able to determine in what such
difference consists allowing the remark to have applied in its full
force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance I felt it on that
eventful morning still more fully applicable to his moral temperament
and character nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which
seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings
than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought
pervading even his most trivial actions intruding upon his moments
of dalliance and interweaving itself with his very flashes of
merriment like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning
masks in the cornices around the temples of persepolis

I could not help however repeatedly observing through the mingled
tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon
matters of little importance a certain air of trepidation a degree of
nervous unction in action and in speech an unquiet excitability of
manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable and upon some
occasions even filled me with alarm frequently too pausing in the
middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten
he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention as if either in
momentary expectation of a visiter or to sounds which must have had
existence in his imagination alone

it was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction
that in turning over a page of the poet and scholar politians
beautiful tragedy the orfeo the first native italian tragedy
which lay near me upon an ottoman I discovered a passage underlined in
pencil it was a passage towards the end of the third act a passage of
the most heart-stirring excitement a passage which although tainted
with impurity no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion no
woman without a sigh the whole page was blotted with fresh tears and
upon the opposite interleaf were the following english lines
written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my
acquaintance that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own 

     thou wast that all to me love
     for which my soul did pine 
     a green isle in the sea love
     a fountain and a shrine
     all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers
     and all the flowers were mine
     ah dream too bright to last
     ah starry hope that didst arise
     but to be overcast
     a voice from out the future cries
     onward but oer the past
     dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
     mute motionless aghast
     for alas  alas  with me
     the light of life is oer
     no more no more no more
     such language holds the solemn sea
     to the sands upon the shore
     shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree
     or the stricken eagle soar
     now all my hours are trances
     and all my nightly dreams
     are where the dark eye glances
     and where thy footstep gleams
     in what ethereal dances
     by what italian streams
     alas  for that accursed time
     they bore thee oer the billow
     from love to titled age and crime
     and an unholy pillow 
     from me and from our misty clime
     where weeps the silver willow

that these lines were written in english a language with which I had
not believed their author acquainted afforded me little matter for
surprise I was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements and of
the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation to
be astonished at any similar discovery but the place of date I must
confess occasioned me no little amazement it had been originally
written london and afterwards carefully overscored not however so
effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye I say this
occasioned me no little amazement for I well remember that in a former
conversation with a friend I particularly inquired if he had at any
time met in london the marchesa dI mentonI who for some years previous
to her marriage had resided in that city when his answer if I mistake
not gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of
great britain I might as well here mention that I have more than
once heard without of course giving credit to a report
involving so many improbabilities that the person of whom I speak was
not only by birth but in education an englishman

    

there is one painting said he without being aware of my notice of
the tragedy there is still one painting which you have not seen and
throwing aside a drapery he discovered a full-length portrait of the
marchesa aphrodite

 human art could have done no more in the delineation of her
superhuman beauty the same ethereal figure which stood before me the
preceding night upon the steps of the ducal palace stood before me once
again but in the expression of the countenance which was beaming all
over with smiles there still lurked incomprehensible anomaly that
fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the
perfection of the beautiful her right arm lay folded over her bosom
with her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase
one small fairy foot alone visible barely touched the earth and
scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to
encircle and enshrine her loveliness floated a pair of the most
delicately imagined wings my glance fell from the painting to the
figure of my friend and the vigorous words of chapmans bussy
dambois quivered instinctively upon my lips

                     he is up
     there like a roman statue  he will stand
     till death hath made him marble

come he said at length turning towards a table of richly enamelled
and massive silver upon which were a few goblets fantastically
stained together with two large etruscan vases fashioned in the same
extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait and
filled with what I supposed to be johannisberger come he said
abruptly let us drink it is early but let us drink it is indeed
early he continued musingly as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer
made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise it is
indeed early but what matters it let us drink let us pour out an
offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are
so eager to subdue and having made me pledge him in a bumper he
swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine

to dream he continued resuming the tone of his desultory
conversation as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the
magnificent vases to dream has been the business of my life I have
therefore framed for myself as you see a bower of dreams in the heart
of venice could I have erected a better you behold around you it is
true a medley of architectural embellishments the chastity of ionia
is offended by antediluvian devices and the sphynxes of egypt are
outstretched upon carpets of gold yet the effect is incongruous to
the timid alone proprieties of place and especially of time are
the bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the
magnificent once I was myself a decorist but that sublimation of folly
has palled upon my soul all this is now the fitter for my purpose like
these arabesque censers my spirit is writhing in fire and the delirium
of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land
of real dreams whither I am now rapidly departing he here paused
abruptly bent his head to his bosom and seemed to listen to a sound
which I could not hear at length erecting his frame he looked
upwards and ejaculated the lines of the bishop of chichester

     stay for me there  I will not fail
     to meet thee in that hollow vale

in the next instant confessing the power of the wine he threw himself
at full-length upon an ottoman

a quick step was now heard upon the staircase and a loud knock at
the door rapidly succeeded I was hastening to anticipate a second
disturbance when a page of mentonis household burst into the room and
faltered out in a voice choking with emotion the incoherent words
my mistress my mistress poisoned poisoned oh beautiful oh
beautiful aphrodite

bewildered I flew to the ottoman and endeavored to arouse the sleeper
to a sense of the startling intelligence but his limbs were rigid his
lips were livid his lately beaming eyes were riveted in death
I staggered back towards the table my hand fell upon a cracked and
blackened goblet and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth
flashed suddenly over my soul




the pit and the pendulum

     impia tortorum longos hic turba furores
     sanguinis innocuI non satiata aluit
     sospite nunc patria fracto nunc funeris antro
     mors ubI dira fuit vita salusque patent

     quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected
     upon the site of the jacobin club house at paris

I was sick sick unto death with that long agony and when they at
length unbound me and I was permitted to sit I felt that my senses
were leaving me the sentence the dread sentence of death was the last
of distinct accentuation which reached my ears after that the sound of
the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate
hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its
association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel this only for a
brief period for presently I heard no more yet for a while I saw
but with how terrible an exaggeration I saw the lips of the black-robed
judges they appeared to me white whiter than the sheet upon which
I trace these words and thin even to grotesqueness thin with the
intensity of their expression of firmness of immoveable resolution of
stern contempt of human torture I saw that the decrees of what to me
was fate were still issuing from those lips I saw them writhe with
a deadly locution I saw them fashion the syllables of my name and i
shuddered because no sound succeeded I saw too for a few moments of
delirious horror the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable
draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment and then my vision
fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table at first they wore the
aspect of charity and seemed white and slender angels who would save
me but then all at once there came a most deadly nausea over my
spirit and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched
the wire of a galvanic battery while the angel forms became meaningless
spectres with heads of flame and I saw that from them there would be
no help and then there stole into my fancy like a rich musical note
the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave the thought
came gently and stealthily and it seemed long before it attained full
appreciation but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and
entertain it the figures of the judges vanished as if magically from
before me the tall candles sank into nothingness their flames went out
utterly the blackness of darkness supervened all sensations appeared
swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into hades then
silence and stillness night were the universe

I had swooned but still will not say that all of consciousness was
lost what of it there remained I will not attempt to define or even
to describe yet all was not lost in the deepest slumber no in
delirium no in a swoon no in death no even in the grave all is
not lost else there is no immortality for man arousing from the most
profound of slumbers we break the gossamer web of some dream yet in a
second afterward so frail may that web have been we remember not
that we have dreamed in the return to life from the swoon there are two
stages first that of the sense of mental or spiritual secondly that
of the sense of physical existence it seems probable that if upon
reaching the second stage we could recall the impressions of the
first we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf
beyond and that gulf is what how at least shall we distinguish its
shadows from those of the tomb but if the impressions of what I have
termed the first stage are not at will recalled yet after long
interval do they not come unbidden while we marvel whence they come
he who has never swooned is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly
familiar faces in coals that glow is not he who beholds floating
in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view is not he who
ponders over the perfume of some novel flower is not he whose brain
grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has
never before arrested his attention

amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember amid earnest
struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness
into which my soul had lapsed there have been moments when I have
dreamed of success there have been brief very brief periods when i
have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch
assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming
unconsciousness these shadows of memory tell indistinctly of tall
figures that lifted and bore me in silence down down still
down till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the
interminableness of the descent they tell also of a vague horror at
my heart on account of that hearts unnatural stillness then comes a
sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things as if those who
bore me a ghastly train had outrun in their descent the limits of
the limitless and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil after
this I call to mind flatness and dampness and then all is madness the
madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things

very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound the
tumultuous motion of the heart and in my ears the sound of its
beating then a pause in which all is blank then again sound and
motion and touch a tingling sensation pervading my frame then the
mere consciousness of existence without thought a condition which
lasted long then very suddenly thought and shuddering terror and
earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state then a strong desire
to lapse into insensibility then a rushing revival of soul and a
successful effort to move and now a full memory of the trial of the
judges of the sable draperies of the sentence of the sickness of
the swoon then entire forgetfulness of all that followed of all that
a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to
recall

so far I had not opened my eyes I felt that I lay upon my back
unbound I reached out my hand and it fell heavily upon something damp
and hard there I suffered it to remain for many minutes while I strove
to imagine where and what I could be I longed yet dared not to employ
my vision I dreaded the first glance at objects around me it was not
that I feared to look upon things horrible but that I grew aghast lest
there should be nothing to see at length with a wild desperation
at heart I quickly unclosed my eyes my worst thoughts then were
confirmed the blackness of eternal night encompassed me I struggled
for breath the intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle
me the atmosphere was intolerably close I still lay quietly and
made effort to exercise my reason I brought to mind the inquisitorial
proceedings and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition
the sentence had passed and it appeared to me that a very long interval
of time had since elapsed yet not for a moment did I suppose myself
actually dead such a supposition notwithstanding what we read in
fiction is altogether inconsistent with real existence but where and
in what state was I the condemned to death I knew perished usually at
the autos-da-fe and one of these had been held on the very night of the
day of my trial had I been remanded to my dungeon to await the next
sacrifice which would not take place for many months this I at once
saw could not be victims had been in immediate demand moreover my
dungeon as well as all the condemned cells at toledo had stone floors
and light was not altogether excluded

a fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart
and for a brief period I once more relapsed into insensibility upon
recovering I at once started to my feet trembling convulsively
in every fibre I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all
directions I felt nothing yet dreaded to move a step lest I should be
impeded by the walls of a tomb perspiration burst from every pore and
stood in cold big beads upon my forehead the agony of suspense grew
at length intolerable and I cautiously moved forward with my arms
extended and my eyes straining from their sockets in the hope of
catching some faint ray of light I proceeded for many paces but still
all was blackness and vacancy I breathed more freely it seemed evident
that mine was not at least the most hideous of fates

and now as I still continued to step cautiously onward there came
thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of
toledo of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated fables i
had always deemed them but yet strange and too ghastly to repeat save
in a whisper was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean
world of darkness or what fate perhaps even more fearful awaited
me that the result would be death and a death of more than customary
bitterness I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt the
mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me

my outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction it
was a wall seemingly of stone masonry very smooth slimy and cold
I followed it up stepping with all the careful distrust with which
certain antique narratives had inspired me this process however
afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon as
I might make its circuit and return to the point whence I set out
without being aware of the fact so perfectly uniform seemed the wall
I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket when led
into the inquisitorial chamber but it was gone my clothes had been
exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge I had thought of forcing the
blade in some minute crevice of the masonry so as to identify my point
of departure the difficulty nevertheless was but trivial although
in the disorder of my fancy it seemed at first insuperable I tore a
part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length
and at right angles to the wall in groping my way around the prison i
could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit so at
least I thought but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon
or upon my own weakness the ground was moist and slippery I staggered
onward for some time when I stumbled and fell my excessive fatigue
induced me to remain prostrate and sleep soon overtook me as I lay

upon awaking and stretching forth an arm I found beside me a loaf
and a pitcher with water I was too much exhausted to reflect upon
this circumstance but ate and drank with avidity shortly afterward i
resumed my tour around the prison and with much toil came at last upon
the fragment of the serge up to the period when I fell I had counted
fifty-two paces and upon resuming my walk I had counted forty-eight
more when I arrived at the rag there were in all then a hundred
paces and admitting two paces to the yard I presumed the dungeon to
be fifty yards in circuit I had met however with many angles in the
wall and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault for
vault I could not help supposing it to be

I had little object certainly no hope in these researches but a vague
curiosity prompted me to continue them quitting the wall I resolved
to cross the area of the enclosure at first I proceeded with extreme
caution for the floor although seemingly of solid material was
treacherous with slime at length however I took courage and did not
hesitate to step firmly endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as
possible I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner when
the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs
I stepped on it and fell violently on my face

in the confusion attending my fall I did not immediately apprehend a
somewhat startling circumstance which yet in a few seconds afterward
and while I still lay prostrate arrested my attention it was this my
chin rested upon the floor of the prison but my lips and the upper
portion of my head although seemingly at a less elevation than the
chin touched nothing at the same time my forehead seemed bathed in
a clammy vapor and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my
nostrils I put forward my arm and shuddered to find that I had fallen
at the very brink of a circular pit whose extent of course I had
no means of ascertaining at the moment groping about the masonry just
below the margin I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment and let it
fall into the abyss for many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations
as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent at length
there was a sullen plunge into water succeeded by loud echoes at the
same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening and as
rapid closing of a door overhead while a faint gleam of light flashed
suddenly through the gloom and as suddenly faded away

I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me and congratulated
myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped another step
before my fall and the world had seen me no more and the death just
avoided was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and
frivolous in the tales respecting the inquisition to the victims of its
tyranny there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies
or death with its most hideous moral horrors I had been reserved for
the latter by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung until i
trembled at the sound of my own voice and had become in every respect a
fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me

shaking in every limb I groped my way back to the wall resolving
there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells of which my
imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon
in other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at
once by a plunge into one of these abysses but now I was the veriest of
cowards neither could I forget what I had read of these pits that the
sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan

agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours but at length i
again slumbered upon arousing I found by my side as before a loaf
and a pitcher of water a burning thirst consumed me and I emptied
the vessel at a draught it must have been drugged for scarcely had i
drunk before I became irresistibly drowsy a deep sleep fell upon me a
sleep like that of death how long it lasted of course I know not
but when once again I unclosed my eyes the objects around me were
visible by a wild sulphurous lustre the origin of which I could not
at first determine I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the
prison

in its size I had been greatly mistaken the whole circuit of its walls
did not exceed twenty-five yards for some minutes this fact occasioned
me a world of vain trouble vain indeed for what could be of less
importance under the terrible circumstances which environed me then
the mere dimensions of my dungeon but my soul took a wild interest in
trifles and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had
committed in my measurement the truth at length flashed upon me in my
first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces up to the
period when I fell I must then have been within a pace or two of the
fragment of serge in fact I had nearly performed the circuit of the
vault I then slept and upon awaking I must have returned upon my
steps thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was my
confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with
the wall to the left and ended it with the wall to the right

I had been deceived too in respect to the shape of the enclosure
in feeling my way I had found many angles and thus deduced an idea of
great irregularity so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one
arousing from lethargy or sleep the angles were simply those of a few
slight depressions or niches at odd intervals the general shape of
the prison was square what I had taken for masonry seemed now to be
iron or some other metal in huge plates whose sutures or joints
occasioned the depression the entire surface of this metallic enclosure
was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the
charnel superstition of the monks has given rise the figures of fiends
in aspects of menace with skeleton forms and other more really
fearful images overspread and disfigured the walls I observed that the
outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct but that
the colors seemed faded and blurred as if from the effects of a damp
atmosphere I now noticed the floor too which was of stone in the
centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped but it was
the only one in the dungeon

all this I saw indistinctly and by much effort for my personal
condition had been greatly changed during slumber I now lay upon my
back and at full length on a species of low framework of wood to this
I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle it passed
in many convolutions about my limbs and body leaving at liberty only
my head and my left arm to such extent that I could by dint of much
exertion supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by
my side on the floor I saw to my horror that the pitcher had been
removed I say to my horror for I was consumed with intolerable thirst
this thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate
for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned

looking upward I surveyed the ceiling of my prison it was some thirty
or forty feet overhead and constructed much as the side walls in one
of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention it was
the painted figure of time as he is commonly represented save that in
lieu of a scythe he held what at a casual glance I supposed to be
the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks
there was something however in the appearance of this machine which
caused me to regard it more attentively while I gazed directly upward
at it for its position was immediately over my own I fancied that i
saw it in motion in an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed its
sweep was brief and of course slow I watched it for some minutes
somewhat in fear but more in wonder wearied at length with observing
its dull movement I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell

a slight noise attracted my notice and looking to the floor I saw
several enormous rats traversing it they had issued from the well
which lay just within view to my right even then while I gazed they
came up in troops hurriedly with ravenous eyes allured by the scent
of the meat from this it required much effort and attention to scare
them away

it might have been half an hour perhaps even an hour for I could take
but imperfect note of time before I again cast my eyes upward what
I then saw confounded and amazed me the sweep of the pendulum had
increased in extent by nearly a yard as a natural consequence its
velocity was also much greater but what mainly disturbed me was the
idea that had perceptibly descended I now observed with what horror it
is needless to say that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent
of glittering steel about a foot in length from horn to horn the horns
upward and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor like
a razor also it seemed massy and heavy tapering from the edge into
a solid and broad structure above it was appended to a weighty rod of
brass and the whole hissed as it swung through the air

I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in
torture my cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial
agents the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant
as myself the pit typical of hell and regarded by rumor as the ultima
thule of all their punishments the plunge into this pit I had avoided
by the merest of accidents I knew that surprise or entrapment into
torment formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these
dungeon deaths having failed to fall it was no part of the demon
plan to hurl me into the abyss and thus there being no alternative a
different and a milder destruction awaited me milder I half smiled in
my agony as I thought of such application of such a term

what boots it to tell of the long long hours of horror more than
mortal during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel inch
by inch line by line with a descent only appreciable at intervals that
seemed ages down and still down it came days passed it might have
been that many days passed ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me
with its acrid breath the odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my
nostrils I prayed I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy
descent I grew frantically mad and struggled to force myself upward
against the sweep of the fearful scimitar and then I fell suddenly
calm and lay smiling at the glittering death as a child at some rare
bauble

there was another interval of utter insensibility it was brief for
upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in
the pendulum but it might have been long for I knew there were demons
who took note of my swoon and who could have arrested the vibration at
pleasure upon my recovery too I felt very oh inexpressibly sick
and weak as if through long inanition even amid the agonies of that
period the human nature craved food with painful effort I outstretched
my left arm as far as my bonds permitted and took possession of the
small remnant which had been spared me by the rats as I put a portion
of it within my lips there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of
joy of hope yet what business had I with hope it was as I say a
half formed thought man has many such which are never completed I felt
that it was of joy of hope but felt also that it had perished in its
formation in vain I struggled to perfect to regain it long suffering
had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind I was an
imbecile an idiot

the vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length I saw
that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart
it would fray the serge of my robe it would return and repeat its
operations again and again notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep
some thirty feet or more and the hissing vigor of its descent
sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron still the fraying of my
robe would be all that for several minutes it would accomplish and
at this thought I paused I dared not go farther than this reflection i
dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention as if in so dwelling
I could arrest here the descent of the steel I forced myself to
ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the
garment upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of
cloth produces on the nerves I pondered upon all this frivolity until
my teeth were on edge

down steadily down it crept I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting
its downward with its lateral velocity to the right to the left far
and wide with the shriek of a damned spirit to my heart with the
stealthy pace of the tiger I alternately laughed and howled as the one
or the other idea grew predominant

down certainly relentlessly down it vibrated within three inches of
my bosom I struggled violently furiously to free my left arm this
was free only from the elbow to the hand I could reach the latter from
the platter beside me to my mouth with great effort but no farther
could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow I would have seized
and attempted to arrest the pendulum I might as well have attempted to
arrest an avalanche

down still unceasingly still inevitably down I gasped and struggled
at each vibration I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep my eyes
followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most
unmeaning despair they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent
although death would have been a relief oh how unspeakable still i
quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery
would precipitate that keen glistening axe upon my bosom it was hope
that prompted the nerve to quiver the frame to shrink it was hope the
hope that triumphs on the rack that whispers to the death-condemned
even in the dungeons of the inquisition

I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual
contact with my robe and with this observation there suddenly came over
my spirit all the keen collected calmness of despair for the first
time during many hours or perhaps days I thought it now occurred to
me that the bandage or surcingle which enveloped me was unique i
was tied by no separate cord the first stroke of the razorlike crescent
athwart any portion of the band would so detach it that it might be
unwound from my person by means of my left hand but how fearful in
that case the proximity of the steel the result of the slightest
struggle how deadly was it likely moreover that the minions of the
torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility was it
probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum
dreading to find my faint and as it seemed my last hope frustrated
I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast the
surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions save in
the path of the destroying crescent

scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position when
there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the
unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously
alluded and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my
brain when I raised food to my burning lips the whole thought was now
present feeble scarcely sane scarcely definite but still entire
I proceeded at once with the nervous energy of despair to attempt its
execution

for many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which
I lay had been literally swarming with rats they were wild bold
ravenous their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for
motionlessness on my part to make me their prey to what food i
thought have they been accustomed in the well

they had devoured in spite of all my efforts to prevent them all but a
small remnant of the contents of the dish I had fallen into an habitual
see-saw or wave of the hand about the platter and at length the
unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect in their
voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers
with the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained i
thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it then raising
my hand from the floor I lay breathlessly still

at first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the
change at the cessation of movement they shrank alarmedly back many
sought the well but this was only for a moment I had not counted in
vain upon their voracity observing that I remained without motion
one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work and smelt at the
surcingle this seemed the signal for a general rush forth from the
well they hurried in fresh troops they clung to the wood they overran
it and leaped in hundreds upon my person the measured movement of the
pendulum disturbed them not at all avoiding its strokes they busied
themselves with the anointed bandage they pressed they swarmed upon me
in ever accumulating heaps they writhed upon my throat their cold lips
sought my own I was half stifled by their thronging pressure disgust
for which the world has no name swelled my bosom and chilled with a
heavy clamminess my heart yet one minute and I felt that the struggle
would be over plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage I knew
that in more than one place it must be already severed with a more than
human resolution I lay still

nor had I erred in my calculations nor had I endured in vain I at
length felt that I was free the surcingle hung in ribands from my body
but the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom it had
divided the serge of the robe it had cut through the linen beneath
twice again it swung and a sharp sense of pain shot through every
nerve but the moment of escape had arrived at a wave of my hand my
deliverers hurried tumultuously away with a steady movement cautious
sidelong shrinking and slow I slid from the embrace of the bandage
and beyond the reach of the scimitar for the moment at least I was
free

free and in the grasp of the inquisition I had scarcely stepped from
my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison when the
motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up by some
invisible force through the ceiling this was a lesson which I took
desperately to heart my every motion was undoubtedly watched free i
had but escaped death in one form of agony to be delivered unto worse
than death in some other with that thought I rolled my eves
nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in something
unusual some change which at first I could not appreciate
distinctly it was obvious had taken place in the apartment for many
minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction I busied myself in vain
unconnected conjecture during this period I became aware for the
first time of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined
the cell it proceeded from a fissure about half an inch in width
extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls which
thus appeared and were completely separated from the floor i
endeavored but of course in vain to look through the aperture

as I arose from the attempt the mystery of the alteration in the
chamber broke at once upon my understanding I have observed that
although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently
distinct yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite these colors had
now assumed and were momentarily assuming a startling and most intense
brilliancy that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an
aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own demon
eyes of a wild and ghastly vivacity glared upon me in a thousand
directions where none had been visible before and gleamed with the
lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard
as unreal

unreal even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of
the vapour of heated iron a suffocating odour pervaded the prison a
deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies
a richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of
blood I panted I gasped for breath there could be no doubt of the
design of my tormentors oh most unrelenting oh most demoniac of
men I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell amid the
thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness
of the well came over my soul like balm I rushed to its deadly brink
I threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof
illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit
refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw at length it forced it
wrestled its way into my soul it burned itself in upon my shuddering
reason oh for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but
this with a shriek I rushed from the margin and buried my face in my
hands weeping bitterly

the heat rapidly increased and once again I looked up shuddering as
with a fit of the ague there had been a second change in the cell and
now the change was obviously in the form as before it was in vain that
I at first endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking
place but not long was I left in doubt the inquisitorial vengeance had
been hurried by my two-fold escape and there was to be no more dallying
with the king of terrors the room had been square I saw that two of
its iron angles were now acute two consequently obtuse the fearful
difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound in an
instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge but
the alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop
I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal
peace death I said any death but that of the pit fool might i
have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron
to urge me could I resist its glow or if even that could I withstand
its pressure and now flatter and flatter grew the lozenge with a
rapidity that left me no time for contemplation its centre and of
course its greatest width came just over the yawning gulf I shrank
back but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward at length
for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold
on the firm floor of the prison I struggled no more but the agony of
my soul found vent in one loud long and final scream of despair i
felt that I tottered upon the brink I averted my eyes 

there was a discordant hum of human voices there was a loud blast as of
many trumpets there was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders the
fiery walls rushed back an outstretched arm caught my own as I fell
fainting into the abyss it was that of general lasalle the french
army had entered toledo the inquisition was in the hands of its
enemies




the premature burial

there are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing but
which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction
these the mere romanticist must eschew if he do not wish to offend or
to disgust they are with propriety handled only when the severity and
majesty of truth sanctify and sustain them we thrill for example with
the most intense of pleasurable pain over the accounts of the passage
of the beresina of the earthquake at lisbon of the plague at london
of the massacre of st bartholomew or of the stifling of the hundred
and twenty-three prisoners in the black hole at calcutta but in these
accounts it is the fact  it is the reality  it is the history which
excites as inventions we should regard them with simple abhorrence

I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities
on record but in these it is the extent not less than the character
of the calamity which so vividly impresses the fancy I need not remind
the reader that from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries
I might have selected many individual instances more replete with
essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster
the true wretchedness indeed the ultimate woe  is particular not
diffuse that the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit
and never by man the mass  for this let us thank a merciful god

to be buried while alive is beyond question the most terrific of these
extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality that it has
frequently very frequently so fallen will scarcely be denied by those
who think the boundaries which divide life from death are at best
shadowy and vague who shall say where the one ends and where the other
begins we know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations
of all the apparent functions of vitality and yet in which these
cessations are merely suspensions properly so called they are only
temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism a certain period
elapses and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the
magic pinions and the wizard wheels the silver cord was not for ever
loosed nor the golden bowl irreparably broken but where meantime was
the soul

apart however from the inevitable conclusion a priorI that such
causes must produce such effects  that the well-known occurrence of
such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise now and
then to premature interments apart from this consideration we have
the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a
vast number of such interments have actually taken place I might refer
at once if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances one of
very remarkable character and of which the circumstances may be fresh
in the memory of some of my readers occurred not very long ago in the
neighboring city of baltimore where it occasioned a painful intense
and widely-extended excitement the wife of one of the most respectable
citizens a lawyer of eminence and a member of congress was seized with
a sudden and unaccountable illness which completely baffled the skill
of her physicians after much suffering she died or was supposed to
die no one suspected indeed or had reason to suspect that she was
not actually dead she presented all the ordinary appearances of death
the face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline the lips were of
the usual marble pallor the eyes were lustreless there was no warmth
pulsation had ceased for three days the body was preserved unburied
during which it had acquired a stony rigidity the funeral in short
was hastened on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be
decomposition

the lady was deposited in her family vault which for three subsequent
years was undisturbed at the expiration of this term it was opened
for the reception of a sarcophagus  but alas how fearful a shock
awaited the husband who personally threw open the door as its
portals swung outwardly back some white-apparelled object fell rattling
within his arms it was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded
shroud

a careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within
two days after her entombment that her struggles within the coffin had
caused it to fall from a ledge or shelf to the floor where it was so
broken as to permit her escape a lamp which had been accidentally
left full of oil within the tomb was found empty it might have been
exhausted however by evaporation on the uttermost of the steps which
led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin
with which it seemed that she had endeavored to arrest attention by
striking the iron door while thus occupied she probably swooned or
possibly died through sheer terror and in failing her shroud became
entangled in some iron work which projected interiorly thus she
remained and thus she rotted erect

in the year  a case of living inhumation happened in france
attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that
truth is indeed stranger than fiction the heroine of the story was a
mademoiselle victorine lafourcade a young girl of illustrious family
of wealth and of great personal beauty among her numerous suitors was
julien bossuet a poor litterateur or journalist of paris his talents
and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress
by whom he seems to have been truly beloved but her pride of birth
decided her finally to reject him and to wed a monsieur renelle a
banker and a diplomatist of some eminence after marriage however this
gentleman neglected and perhaps even more positively ill-treated her
having passed with him some wretched years she died  at least her
condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw
her she was buried  not in a vault but in an ordinary grave in the
village of her nativity filled with despair and still inflamed by the
memory of a profound attachment the lover journeys from the capital to
the remote province in which the village lies with the romantic purpose
of disinterring the corpse and possessing himself of its luxuriant
tresses he reaches the grave at midnight he unearths the coffin opens
it and is in the act of detaching the hair when he is arrested by the
unclosing of the beloved eyes in fact the lady had been buried
alive vitality had not altogether departed and she was aroused by
the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken
for death he bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village he
employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical
learning in fine she revived she recognized her preserver she
remained with him until by slow degrees she fully recovered her
original health her womans heart was not adamant and this last
lesson of love sufficed to soften it she bestowed it upon bossuet
she returned no more to her husband but concealing from him her
resurrection fled with her lover to america twenty years afterward
the two returned to france in the persuasion that time had so greatly
altered the ladys appearance that her friends would be unable to
recognize her they were mistaken however for at the first meeting
monsieur renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife
this claim she resisted and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her
resistance deciding that the peculiar circumstances with the long
lapse of years had extinguished not only equitably but legally the
authority of the husband

the chirurgical journal of leipsic a periodical of high authority
and merit which some american bookseller would do well to translate
and republish records in a late number a very distressing event of the
character in question

an officer of artillery a man of gigantic stature and of robust
health being thrown from an unmanageable horse received a very severe
contusion upon the head which rendered him insensible at once the
skull was slightly fractured but no immediate danger was apprehended
trepanning was accomplished successfully he was bled and many other of
the ordinary means of relief were adopted gradually however he fell
into a more and more hopeless state of stupor and finally it was
thought that he died

the weather was warm and he was buried with indecent haste in one of
the public cemeteries his funeral took place on thursday on the sunday
following the grounds of the cemetery were as usual much thronged
with visiters and about noon an intense excitement was created by
the declaration of a peasant that while sitting upon the grave of
the officer he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth as if
occasioned by some one struggling beneath at first little attention was
paid to the mans asseveration but his evident terror and the dogged
obstinacy with which he persisted in his story had at length their
natural effect upon the crowd spades were hurriedly procured and the
grave which was shamefully shallow was in a few minutes so far thrown
open that the head of its occupant appeared he was then seemingly dead
but he sat nearly erect within his coffin the lid of which in his
furious struggles he had partially uplifted

he was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital and there pronounced
to be still living although in an asphytic condition after some hours
he revived recognized individuals of his acquaintance and in broken
sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave

from what he related it was clear that he must have been conscious
of life for more than an hour while inhumed before lapsing into
insensibility the grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an
exceedingly porous soil and thus some air was necessarily admitted
he heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead and endeavored to make
himself heard in turn it was the tumult within the grounds of the
cemetery he said which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep but
no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors
of his position

this patient it is recorded was doing well and seemed to be in a fair
way of ultimate recovery but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical
experiment the galvanic battery was applied and he suddenly expired in
one of those ecstatic paroxysms which occasionally it superinduces

the mention of the galvanic battery nevertheless recalls to my memory
a well known and very extraordinary case in point where its action
proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of london
who had been interred for two days this occurred in  and created
at the time a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject
of converse

the patient mr edward stapleton had died apparently of typhus fever
accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity
of his medical attendants upon his seeming decease his friends were
requested to sanction a post-mortem examination but declined to permit
it as often happens when such refusals are made the practitioners
resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure in private
arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of
body-snatchers with which london abounds and upon the third night
after the funeral the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight
feet deep and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private
hospitals

an incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen
when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an
application of the battery one experiment succeeded another and the
customary effects supervened with nothing to characterize them in any
respect except upon one or two occasions a more than ordinary degree
of life-likeness in the convulsive action

it grew late the day was about to dawn and it was thought expedient
at length to proceed at once to the dissection a student however was
especially desirous of testing a theory of his own and insisted upon
applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles a rough gash was
made and a wire hastily brought in contact when the patient with a
hurried but quite unconvulsive movement arose from the table stepped
into the middle of the floor gazed about him uneasily for a few
seconds and then spoke what he said was unintelligible but words
were uttered the syllabification was distinct having spoken he fell
heavily to the floor

for some moments all were paralyzed with awe but the urgency of the
case soon restored them their presence of mind it was seen that mr
stapleton was alive although in a swoon upon exhibition of ether he
revived and was rapidly restored to health and to the society of his
friends from whom however all knowledge of his resuscitation was
withheld until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended their
wonder their rapturous astonishment may be conceived

the most thrilling peculiarity of this incident nevertheless is
involved in what mr s himself asserts he declares that at no period
was he altogether insensible that dully and confusedly he was aware
of everything which happened to him from the moment in which he was
pronounced dead by his physicians to that in which he fell swooning to
the floor of the hospital I am alive were the uncomprehended words
which upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room he had
endeavored in his extremity to utter

it were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these but i
forbear for indeed we have no need of such to establish the fact that
premature interments occur when we reflect how very rarely from the
nature of the case we have it in our power to detect them we must
admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance scarcely
in truth is a graveyard ever encroached upon for any purpose to any
great extent that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the
most fearful of suspicions

fearful indeed the suspicion but more fearful the doom it may be
asserted without hesitation that no event is so terribly well adapted
to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress as is
burial before death the unendurable oppression of the lungs the
stifling fumes from the damp earth the clinging to the death
garments the rigid embrace of the narrow house the blackness of the
absolute night the silence like a sea that overwhelms the unseen but
palpable presence of the conqueror worm these things with the thoughts
of the air and grass above with memory of dear friends who would fly to
save us if but informed of our fate and with consciousness that of this
fate they can never be informed that our hopeless portion is that of
the really dead these considerations I say carry into the heart
which still palpitates a degree of appalling and intolerable horror
from which the most daring imagination must recoil we know of nothing
so agonizing upon earth we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the
realms of the nethermost hell and thus all narratives upon this topic
have an interest profound an interest nevertheless which through
the sacred awe of the topic itself very properly and very peculiarly
depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated what i
have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge of my own positive and
personal experience

for several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder
which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy in default of a more
definitive title although both the immediate and the predisposing
causes and even the actual diagnosis of this disease are still
mysterious its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well
understood its variations seem to be chiefly of degree sometimes the
patient lies for a day only or even for a shorter period in a species
of exaggerated lethargy he is senseless and externally motionless but
the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible some traces of
warmth remain a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek
and upon application of a mirror to the lips we can detect a torpid
unequal and vacillating action of the lungs then again the duration
of the trance is for weeks even for months while the closest scrutiny
and the most rigorous medical tests fail to establish any material
distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of
absolute death very usually he is saved from premature interment solely
by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to
catalepsy by the consequent suspicion excited and above all by
the non-appearance of decay the advances of the malady are luckily
gradual the first manifestations although marked are unequivocal the
fits grow successively more and more distinctive and endure each for a
longer term than the preceding in this lies the principal security from
inhumation the unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme
character which is occasionally seen would almost inevitably be
consigned alive to the tomb

my own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in
medical books sometimes without any apparent cause I sank little by
little into a condition of hemi-syncope or half swoon and in this
condition without pain without ability to stir or strictly speaking
to think but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the
presence of those who surrounded my bed I remained until the crisis of
the disease restored me suddenly to perfect sensation at other
times I was quickly and impetuously smitten I grew sick and numb and
chilly and dizzy and so fell prostrate at once then for weeks all
was void and black and silent and nothing became the universe
total annihilation could be no more from these latter attacks I awoke
however with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the
seizure just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar
who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night just
so tardily just so wearily just so cheerily came back the light of the
soul to me

apart from the tendency to trance however my general health appeared
to be good nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one
prevalent malady unless indeed an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep
may be looked upon as superinduced upon awaking from slumber I could
never gain at once thorough possession of my senses and always
remained for many minutes in much bewilderment and perplexity the
mental faculties in general but the memory in especial being in a
condition of absolute abeyance

in all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral
distress an infinitude my fancy grew charnel I talked of worms of
tombs and epitaphs I was lost in reveries of death and the idea
of premature burial held continual possession of my brain the ghastly
danger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night in the former
the torture of meditation was excessive in the latter supreme when
the grim darkness overspread the earth then with every horror of
thought I shook shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse when
nature could endure wakefulness no longer it was with a struggle that
I consented to sleep for I shuddered to reflect that upon awaking i
might find myself the tenant of a grave and when finally I sank into
slumber it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms above
which with vast sable overshadowing wing hovered predominant the
one sepulchral idea

from the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams
I select for record but a solitary vision methought I was immersed in
a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity suddenly
there came an icy hand upon my forehead and an impatient gibbering
voice whispered the word arise within my ear

I sat erect the darkness was total I could not see the figure of him
who had aroused me I could call to mind neither the period at which i
had fallen into the trance nor the locality in which I then lay while
I remained motionless and busied in endeavors to collect my thought
the cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist shaking it petulantly
while the gibbering voice said again

arise did I not bid thee arise

and who I demanded art thou

I have no name in the regions which I inhabit replied the voice
mournfully I was mortal but am fiend I was merciless but am
pitiful thou dost feel that I shudder my teeth chatter as I speak
yet it is not with the chilliness of the night of the night without
end but this hideousness is insufferable how canst thou tranquilly
sleep I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies these sights
are more than I can bear get thee up come with me into the outer
night and let me unfold to thee the graves is not this a spectacle of
woe behold

I looked and the unseen figure which still grasped me by the wrist
had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind and from each
issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay so that I could see into
the innermost recesses and there view the shrouded bodies in their
sad and solemn slumbers with the worm but alas the real sleepers were
fewer by many millions than those who slumbered not at all and there
was a feeble struggling and there was a general sad unrest and from
out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling
from the garments of the buried and of those who seemed tranquilly
to repose I saw that a vast number had changed in a greater or less
degree the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been
entombed and the voice again said to me as I gazed

is it not oh is it not a pitiful sight but before I could find
words to reply the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist the phosphoric
lights expired and the graves were closed with a sudden violence while
from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries saying again is it
not o god is it not a very pitiful sight

phantasies such as these presenting themselves at night extended their
terrific influence far into my waking hours my nerves became thoroughly
unstrung and I fell a prey to perpetual horror I hesitated to ride or
to walk or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home
in fact I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence
of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy lest falling into
one of my usual fits I should be buried before my real condition could
be ascertained I doubted the care the fidelity of my dearest friends
I dreaded that in some trance of more than customary duration they
might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable I even went so
far as to fear that as I occasioned much trouble they might be glad to
consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid
of me altogether it was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the
most solemn promises I exacted the most sacred oaths that under no
circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially
advanced as to render farther preservation impossible and even
then my mortal terrors would listen to no reason would accept no
consolation I entered into a series of elaborate precautions among
other things I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being
readily opened from within the slightest pressure upon a long lever
that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back
there were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light
and convenient receptacles for food and water within immediate reach of
the coffin intended for my reception this coffin was warmly and softly
padded and was provided with a lid fashioned upon the principle of the
vault-door with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest
movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty besides
all this there was suspended from the roof of the tomb a large bell
the rope of which it was designed should extend through a hole in the
coffin and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse but alas
what avails the vigilance against the destiny of man not even these
well-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of
living inhumation a wretch to these agonies foredoomed

there arrived an epoch as often before there had arrived in which i
found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first
feeble and indefinite sense of existence slowly with a tortoise
gradation approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day a torpid
uneasiness an apathetic endurance of dull pain no care no hope no
effort then after a long interval a ringing in the ears then
after a lapse still longer a prickling or tingling sensation in the
extremities then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence
during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought then a
brief re-sinking into non-entity then a sudden recovery at length the
slight quivering of an eyelid and immediately thereupon an electric
shock of a terror deadly and indefinite which sends the blood in
torrents from the temples to the heart and now the first positive
effort to think and now the first endeavor to remember and now a
partial and evanescent success and now the memory has so far regained
its dominion that in some measure I am cognizant of my state I feel
that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep I recollect that I have been
subject to catalepsy and now at last as if by the rush of an ocean
my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim danger by the one
spectral and ever-prevalent idea

for some minutes after this fancy possessed me I remained without
motion and why I could not summon courage to move I dared not
make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate and yet there was
something at my heart which whispered me it was sure despair such as
no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being despair alone
urged me after long irresolution to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes
I uplifted them it was dark all dark I knew that the fit was over i
knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed I knew that i
had now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties and yet it was
dark all dark the intense and utter raylessness of the night that
endureth for evermore

I endeavored to shriek and my lips and my parched tongue moved
convulsively together in the attempt but no voice issued from the
cavernous lungs which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent
mountain gasped and palpitated with the heart at every elaborate and
struggling inspiration

the movement of the jaws in this effort to cry aloud showed me that
they were bound up as is usual with the dead I felt too that I lay
upon some hard substance and by something similar my sides were
also closely compressed so far I had not ventured to stir any of my
limbs but now I violently threw up my arms which had been lying at
length with the wrists crossed they struck a solid wooden substance
which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six
inches from my face I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a
coffin at last

and now amid all my infinite miseries came sweetly the cherub
hope for I thought of my precautions I writhed and made spasmodic
exertions to force open the lid it would not move I felt my wrists for
the bell-rope it was not to be found and now the comforter fled for
ever and a still sterner despair reigned triumphant for I could not
help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully
prepared and then too there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong
peculiar odor of moist earth the conclusion was irresistible I was
not within the vault I had fallen into a trance while absent from
home while among strangers when or how I could not remember and
it was they who had buried me as a dog nailed up in some common
coffin and thrust deep deep and for ever into some ordinary and
nameless grave

as this awful conviction forced itself thus into the innermost
chambers of my soul I once again struggled to cry aloud and in this
second endeavor I succeeded a long wild and continuous shriek or
yell of agony resounded through the realms of the subterranean night

hillo hillo there said a gruff voice in reply

what the devils the matter now said a second

get out o that said a third

what do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style like a
cattymount said a fourth and hereupon I was seized and shaken
without ceremony for several minutes by a junto of very rough-looking
individuals they did not arouse me from my slumber for I was wide
awake when I screamed but they restored me to the full possession of my
memory

this adventure occurred near richmond in virginia accompanied by a
friend I had proceeded upon a gunning expedition some miles down the
banks of the james river night approached and we were overtaken by
a storm the cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream and
laden with garden mould afforded us the only available shelter we made
the best of it and passed the night on board I slept in one of the
only two berths in the vessel and the berths of a sloop of sixty or
twenty tons need scarcely be described that which I occupied had no
bedding of any kind its extreme width was eighteen inches the distance
of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same I found it
a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in nevertheless i
slept soundly and the whole of my vision for it was no dream and no
nightmare arose naturally from the circumstances of my position from
my ordinary bias of thought and from the difficulty to which I have
alluded of collecting my senses and especially of regaining my memory
for a long time after awaking from slumber the men who shook me were
the crew of the sloop and some laborers engaged to unload it from the
load itself came the earthly smell the bandage about the jaws was a
silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head in default of my
customary nightcap

the tortures endured however were indubitably quite equal for the
time to those of actual sepulture they were fearfully they were
inconceivably hideous but out of evil proceeded good for their very
excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion my soul acquired
tone acquired temper I went abroad I took vigorous exercise i
breathed the free air of heaven I thought upon other subjects than
death I discarded my medical books buchan I burned I read no night
thoughts no fustian about churchyards no bugaboo tales such as
this in short I became a new man and lived a mans life from that
memorable night I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions and with
them vanished the cataleptic disorder of which perhaps they had been
less the consequence than the cause

there are moments when even to the sober eye of reason the world of
our sad humanity may assume the semblance of a hell but the imagination
of man is no carathis to explore with impunity its every cavern alas
the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether
fanciful but like the demons in whose company afrasiab made his voyage
down the oxus they must sleep or they will devour us they must be
suffered to slumber or we perish




the domain of arnheim

     the garden like a lady fair was cut
     that lay as if she slumbered in delight
     and to the open skies her eyes did shut
     the azure fields of heaven were sembled right
     in a large round set with the flowers of light
     the flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew
     that hung upon their azure leaves did shew
     like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue

from his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend ellison
along nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense i
mean it as synonymous with happiness the person of whom I speak seemed
born for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of turgot price
priestley and condorcet of exemplifying by individual instance
what has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists in the brief
existence of ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma that in
mans very nature lies some hidden principle the antagonist of bliss
an anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that in
general from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the
wretchedness of mankind that as a species we have in our possession the
as yet unwrought elements of content and that even now in the present
darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social
condition it is not impossible that man the individual under certain
unusual and highly fortuitous conditions may be happy

with opinions such as these my young friend too was fully imbued and
thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which
distinguished his life was in great measure the result of preconcert
it is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which
now and then stands so well in the stead of experience mr ellison
would have found himself precipitated by the very extraordinary success
of his life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those
of pre-eminent endowments but it is by no means my object to pen an
essay on happiness the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few
words he admitted but four elementary principles or more strictly
conditions of bliss that which he considered chief was strange to
say the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open
air the health he said attainable by other means is scarcely worth
the name he instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter and pointed to
the tillers of the earth the only people who as a class can be fairly
considered happier than others his second condition was the love of
woman his third and most difficult of realization was the contempt
of ambition his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit and he held
that other things being equal the extent of attainable happiness was
in proportion to the spirituality of this object

ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts
lavished upon him by fortune in personal grace and beauty he exceeded
all men his intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of
knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity his
family was one of the most illustrious of the empire his bride was the
loveliest and most devoted of women his possessions had been always
ample but on the attainment of his majority it was discovered that
one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf
which startle the whole social world amid which they occur and seldom
fail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their
objects

it appears that about a hundred years before mr ellisons coming of
age there had died in a remote province one mr seabright ellison
this gentleman had amassed a princely fortune and having no immediate
connections conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate
for a century after his decease minutely and sagaciously directing the
various modes of investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the
nearest of blood bearing the name of ellison who should be alive at
the end of the hundred years many attempts had been made to set aside
this singular bequest their ex post facto character rendered them
abortive but the attention of a jealous government was aroused and a
legislative act finally obtained forbidding all similar accumulations
this act however did not prevent young ellison from entering into
possession on his twenty-first birthday as the heir of his ancestor
seabright of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars


when it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited
there were of course many speculations as to the mode of its disposal
the magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all
who thought on the topic the possessor of any appreciable amount of
money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things
with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen it would have
been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable
extravagances of his time or busying himself with political
intrigue or aiming at ministerial power or purchasing increase
of nobility or collecting large museums of virtu or playing the
munificent patron of letters of science of art or endowing and
bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity but for the
inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir these objects
and all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field
recourse was had to figures and these but sufficed to confound it was
seen that even at three per cent the annual income of the inheritance
amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand
dollars which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand
per month or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day
or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour or six and twenty
dollars for every minute that flew thus the usual track of supposition
was thoroughly broken up men knew not what to imagine there were some
who even conceived that mr ellison would divest himself of at least
one-half of his fortune as of utterly superfluous opulence enriching
whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance to the
nearest of these he did in fact abandon the very unusual wealth which
was his own before the inheritance

I was not surprised however to perceive that he had long made up his
mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends
nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision in regard to
individual charities he had satisfied his conscience in the possibility
of any improvement properly so called being effected by man himself in
the general condition of man he had I am sorry to confess it little
faith upon the whole whether happily or unhappily he was thrown back
in very great measure upon self

in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet he comprehended
moreover the true character the august aims the supreme majesty and
dignity of the poetic sentiment the fullest if not the sole proper
satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the
creation of novel forms of beauty some peculiarities either in his
early education or in the nature of his intellect had tinged with
what is termed materialism all his ethical speculations and it was this
bias perhaps which led him to believe that the most advantageous at
least if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise lies
in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness thus it
happened he became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term
in its every-day acceptation or it might have been that he neglected
to become either merely in pursuance of his idea that in contempt of
ambition is to be found one of the essential principles of happiness on
earth is it not indeed possible that while a high order of genius
is necessarily ambitious the highest is above that which is termed
ambition and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton
have contentedly remained mute and inglorious I believe that the
world has never seen and that unless through some series of accidents
goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion the world
will never see that full extent of triumphant execution in the richer
domains of art of which the human nature is absolutely capable

ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man lived more
profoundly enamored of music and poetry under other circumstances than
those which invested him it is not impossible that he would have become
a painter sculpture although in its nature rigorously poetical was too
limited in its extent and consequences to have occupied at any time
much of his attention and I have now mentioned all the provinces in
which the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it
capable of expatiating but ellison maintained that the richest the
truest and most natural if not altogether the most extensive province
had been unaccountably neglected no definition had spoken of the
landscape-gardener as of the poet yet it seemed to my friend that the
creation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper muse the most
magnificent of opportunities here indeed was the fairest field for
the display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of
novel beauty the elements to enter into combination being by a vast
superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in the
multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees he recognised the
most direct and energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness and
in the direction or concentration of this effort or more properly
in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth he
perceived that he should be employing the best means laboring to the
greatest advantage in the fulfilment not only of his own destiny as
poet but of the august purposes for which the deity had implanted the
poetic sentiment in man

its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth in his
explanation of this phraseology mr ellison did much toward solving
what has always seemed to me an enigma I mean the fact which none
but the ignorant dispute that no such combination of scenery exists in
nature as the painter of genius may produce no such paradises are to
be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of claude in the most
enchanting of natural landscapes there will always be found a defect
or an excess many excesses and defects while the component parts may
defy individually the highest skill of the artist the arrangement
of these parts will always be susceptible of improvement in short no
position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth
from which an artistical eye looking steadily will not find matter of
offence in what is termed the composition of the landscape and
yet how unintelligible is this in all other matters we are justly
instructed to regard nature as supreme with her details we shrink from
competition who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip or to
improve the proportions of the lily of the valley the criticism which
says of sculpture or portraiture that here nature is to be exalted or
idealized rather than imitated is in error no pictorial or sculptural
combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach the
living and breathing beauty in landscape alone is the principle of the
critic true and having felt its truth here it is but the headlong
spirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it true
throughout all the domains of art having I say felt its truth here
for the feeling is no affectation or chimera the mathematics afford no
more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his art yields the
artist he not only believes but positively knows that such and
such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone
constitute the true beauty his reasons however have not yet been
matured into expression it remains for a more profound analysis
than the world has yet seen fully to investigate and express them
nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of
all his brethren let a composition be defective let an emendation
be wrought in its mere arrangement of form let this emendation be
submitted to every artist in the world by each will its necessity
be admitted and even far more than this in remedy of the defective
composition each insulated member of the fraternity would have
suggested the identical emendation

I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature
susceptible of exaltation and that therefore her susceptibility of
improvement at this one point was a mystery I had been unable to solve
my own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive
intention of nature would have so arranged the earths surface as to
have fulfilled at all points mans sense of perfection in the beautiful
the sublime or the picturesque but that this primitive intention had
been frustrated by the known geological disturbances disturbances of
form and color grouping in the correction or allaying of which lies
the soul of art the force of this idea was much weakened however by
the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal
and unadapted to any purpose it was ellison who suggested that
they were prognostic of death he thus explained admit the earthly
immortality of man to have been the first intention we have then the
primitive arrangement of the earths surface adapted to his blissful
estate as not existent but designed the disturbances were the
preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition

now said my friend what we regard as exaltation of the landscape
may be really such as respects only the moral or human point of view
each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish
in the picture if we can suppose this picture viewed at large in
mass from some point distant from the earths surface although not
beyond the limits of its atmosphere it is easily understood that what
might improve a closely scrutinized detail may at the same time injure
a general or more distantly observed effect there may be a class of
beings human once but now invisible to humanity to whom from afar
our disorder may seem order our unpicturesqueness picturesque in a
word the earth-angels for whose scrutiny more especially than our own
and for whose death-refined appreciation of the beautiful may have
been set in array by god the wide landscape-gardens of the hemispheres

in the course of discussion my friend quoted some passages from a
writer on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have well treated
his theme

there are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening the natural
and the artificial one seeks to recall the original beauty of the
country by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery cultivating
trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land
detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size
proportion and color which hid from the common observer are revealed
everywhere to the experienced student of nature the result of the
natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all
defects and incongruities in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and
order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles the
artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes
to gratify it has a certain general relation to the various styles of
building there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles
italian terraces and a various mixed old english style which
bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan
architecture whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial
landscape-gardening a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it
a great beauty this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of
order and design and partly moral a terrace with an old moss-covered
balustrade calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed
there in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of
care and human interest

from what I have already observed said ellison you will understand
that I reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty
of the country the original beauty is never so great as that which may
be introduced of course every thing depends on the selection of a
spot with capabilities what is said about detecting and bringing into
practice nice relations of size proportion and color is one of those
mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought
the phrase quoted may mean any thing or nothing and guides in no
degree that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen
rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the
creation of any special wonders or miracles is a proposition better
suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid
dreams of the man of genius the negative merit suggested appertains to
that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate addison into
apotheosis in truth while that virtue which consists in the mere
avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding and can thus be
circumscribed in rule the loftier virtue which flames in creation can
be apprehended in its results alone rule applies but to the merits of
denial to the excellencies which refrain beyond these the critical
art can but suggest we may be instructed to build a cato but we
are in vain told how to conceive a parthenon or an inferno the
thing done however the wonder accomplished and the capacity for
apprehension becomes universal the sophists of the negative school who
through inability to create have scoffed at creation are now found
the loudest in applause what in its chrysalis condition of principle
affronted their demure reason never fails in its maturity of
accomplishment to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty

the authors observations on the artificial style continued ellison
are less objectionable a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to
it a great beauty this is just as also is the reference to the sense
of human interest the principle expressed is incontrovertible but
there may be something beyond it there may be an object in keeping with
the principle an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed
by individuals yet which if attained would lend a charm to the
landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human
interest could bestow a poet having very unusual pecuniary resources
might while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture or as
our author expresses it of interest so imbue his designs at once with
extent and novelty of beauty as to convey the sentiment of spiritual
interference it will be seen that in bringing about such result he
secures all the advantages of interest or design while relieving his
work of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art in the
most rugged of wildernesses in the most savage of the scenes of pure
nature there is apparent the art of a creator yet this art is apparent
to reflection only in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling
now let us suppose this sense of the almighty design to be one step
depressed to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with
the sense of human art to form an intermedium between the two let
us imagine for example a landscape whose combined vastness and
definitiveness whose united beauty magnificence and strangeness
shall convey the idea of care or culture or superintendence on the
part of beings superior yet akin to humanity then the sentiment of
interest is preserved while the art intervolved is made to assume the
air of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not god
nor an emanation from god but which still is nature in the sense of the
handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god

it was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision
such as this in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the
personal superintendence of his plans in the unceasing object which
these plans afforded in the high spirituality of the object in
the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel in the
perennial springs with which it gratified without possibility of
satiating that one master passion of his soul the thirst for beauty
above all it was in the sympathy of a woman not unwomanly whose
loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of
paradise that ellison thought to find and found exemption from
the ordinary cares of humanity with a far greater amount of positive
happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of de stael

I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the
marvels which my friend did actually accomplish I wish to describe but
am disheartened by the difficulty of description and hesitate between
detail and generality perhaps the better course will be to unite the
two in their extremes

mr ellisons first step regarded of course the choice of a locality
and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point when the luxuriant
nature of the pacific islands arrested his attention in fact he
had made up his mind for a voyage to the south seas when a nights
reflection induced him to abandon the idea were I misanthropic he
said such a locale would suit me the thoroughness of its insulation
and seclusion and the difficulty of ingress and egress would in such
case be the charm of charms but as yet I am not timon I wish the
composure but not the depression of solitude there must remain with me
a certain control over the extent and duration of my repose there will
be frequent hours in which I shall need too the sympathy of the poetic
in what I have done let me seek then a spot not far from a populous
city whose vicinity also will best enable me to execute my plans

in search of a suitable place so situated ellison travelled for several
years and I was permitted to accompany him a thousand spots with
which I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation for reasons which
satisfied me in the end that he was right we came at length to an
elevated table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty affording a
panoramic prospect very little less in extent than that of aetna and
in ellisons opinion as well as my own surpassing the far-famed view
from that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque

I am aware said the traveller as he drew a sigh of deep delight
after gazing on this scene entranced for nearly an hour I know that
here in my circumstances nine-tenths of the most fastidious of men
would rest content this panorama is indeed glorious and I should
rejoice in it but for the excess of its glory the taste of all the
architects I have ever known leads them for the sake of prospect to
put up buildings on hill-tops the error is obvious grandeur in any of
its moods but especially in that of extent startles excites and then
fatigues depresses for the occasional scene nothing can be better for
the constant view nothing worse and in the constant view the most
objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent the worst phase of
extent that of distance it is at war with the sentiment and with the
sense of seclusion the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in
retiring to the country in looking from the summit of a mountain we
cannot help feeling abroad in the world the heart-sick avoid distant
prospects as a pestilence

it was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that
we found a locality with which ellison professed himself satisfied it
is of course needless to say where was the locality the late death of
my friend in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes
of visiters has given to arnheim a species of secret and subdued if
not solemn celebrity similar in kind although infinitely superior in
degree to that which so long distinguished fonthill

the usual approach to arnheim was by the river the visiter left the
city in the early morning during the forenoon he passed between shores
of a tranquil and domestic beauty on which grazed innumerable sheep
their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows by
degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral
care this slowly became merged in a sense of retirement this again in
a consciousness of solitude as the evening approached the channel grew
more narrow the banks more and more precipitous and these latter
were clothed in rich more profuse and more sombre foliage the water
increased in transparency the stream took a thousand turns so that at
no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance
than a furlong at every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an
enchanted circle having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage
a roof of ultramarine satin and no floor the keel balancing itself
with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which by some accident
having been turned upside down floated in constant company with the
substantial one for the purpose of sustaining it the channel now
became a gorge although the term is somewhat inapplicable and I employ
it merely because the language has no word which better represents
the most striking not the most distinctive feature of the scene the
character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of
the shores it was lost altogether in their other traits the walls of
the ravine through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed arose
to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty
feet and inclined so much toward each other as in a great measure to
shut out the light of day while the long plume-like moss which depended
densely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead gave the whole
chasm an air of funereal gloom the windings became more frequent and
intricate and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves so
that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction he was moreover
enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange the thought of nature
still remained but her character seemed to have undergone modification
there was a weird symmetry a thrilling uniformity a wizard propriety
in these her works not a dead branch not a withered leaf not a stray
pebble not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible the crystal
water welled up against the clean granite or the unblemished moss with
a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye

having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours the gloom
deepening every moment a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel
brought it suddenly as if dropped from heaven into a circular basin of
very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge it
was about two hundred yards in diameter and girt in at all points but
one that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered by hills equal
in general height to the walls of the chasm although of a thoroughly
different character their sides sloped from the waters edge at an
angle of some forty-five degrees and they were clothed from base to
summit not a perceptible point escaping in a drapery of the most
gorgeous flower-blossoms scarcely a green leaf being visible among the
sea of odorous and fluctuating color this basin was of great depth but
so transparent was the water that the bottom which seemed to consist of
a thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles was distinctly visible
by glimpses that is to say whenever the eye could permit itself not
to see far down in the inverted heaven the duplicate blooming of the
hills on these latter there were no trees nor even shrubs of any size
the impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness
warmth color quietude uniformity softness delicacy daintiness
voluptuousness and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested
dreams of a new race of fairies laborious tasteful magnificent and
fastidious but as the eye traced upward the myriad-tinted slope from
its sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the
folds of overhanging cloud it became indeed difficult not to fancy
a panoramic cataract of rubies sapphires opals and golden onyxes
rolling silently out of the sky

the visiter shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the
ravine is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun
which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon but which now
confronts him and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless
vista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills

but here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far and
descends into a light canoe of ivory stained with arabesque devices in
vivid scarlet both within and without the poop and beak of this boat
arise high above the water with sharp points so that the general form
is that of an irregular crescent it lies on the surface of the bay
with the proud grace of a swan on its ermined floor reposes a single
feathery paddle of satin-wood but no oarsmen or attendant is to be
seen the guest is bidden to be of good cheer that the fates will take
care of him the larger vessel disappears and he is left alone in the
canoe which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake
while he considers what course to pursue however he becomes aware of a
gentle movement in the fairy bark it slowly swings itself around until
its prow points toward the sun it advances with a gentle but gradually
accelerated velocity while the slight ripples it creates seem to break
about the ivory side in divinest melody-seem to offer the only possible
explanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin
the bewildered voyager looks around him in vain

the canoe steadily proceeds and the rocky gate of the vista is
approached so that its depths can be more distinctly seen to the
right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded it is
observed however that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank
dips into the water still prevails there is not one token of the usual
river debris to the left the character of the scene is softer and more
obviously artificial here the bank slopes upward from the stream in
a very gentle ascent forming a broad sward of grass of a texture
resembling nothing so much as velvet and of a brilliancy of green which
would bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald this plateau
varies in width from ten to three hundred yards reaching from the
river-bank to a wall fifty feet high which extends in an infinity of
curves but following the general direction of the river until lost in
the distance to the westward this wall is of one continuous rock and
has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of
the streams southern bank but no trace of the labor has been suffered
to remain the chiselled stone has the hue of ages and is profusely
overhung and overspread with the ivy the coral honeysuckle the
eglantine and the clematis the uniformity of the top and bottom lines
of the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height
growing singly or in small groups both along the plateau and in the
domain behind the wall but in close proximity to it so that frequent
limbs of the black walnut especially reach over and dip their pendent
extremities into the water farther back within the domain the vision
is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage

these things are observed during the canoes gradual approach to what i
have called the gate of the vista on drawing nearer to this however
its chasm-like appearance vanishes a new outlet from the bay is
discovered to the left in which direction the wall is also seen to
sweep still following the general course of the stream down this new
opening the eye cannot penetrate very far for the stream accompanied
by the wall still bends to the left until both are swallowed up by the
leaves

the boat nevertheless glides magically into the winding channel and
here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite
the wall in the straight vista lofty hills rising occasionally into
mountains and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance still shut in
the scene

floating gently onward but with a velocity slightly augmented the
voyager after many short turns finds his progress apparently barred by
a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold elaborately carved and
fretted and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast-sinking sun
with an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in
flames this gate is inserted in the lofty wall which here appears to
cross the river at right angles in a few moments however it is seen
that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive
curve to the left the wall following it as before while a stream of
considerable volume diverging from the principal one makes its way
with a slight ripple under the door and is thus hidden from sight
the canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate its
ponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded the boat glides
between them and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre
entirely begirt with purple mountains whose bases are laved by a
gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit meantime
the whole paradise of arnheim bursts upon the view there is a gush
of entrancing melody there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet
odor there is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall
slender eastern trees bosky shrubberies flocks of golden and crimson
birds lily-fringed lakes meadows of violets tulips poppies
hyacinths and tuberoses long intertangled lines of silver
streamlets and upspringing confusedly from amid all a mass of
semi-gothic semi-saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle in
mid-air glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels minarets
and pinnacles and seeming the phantom handiwork conjointly of the
sylphs of the fairies of the geniI and of the gnomes




landors cottage

     a pendant to the domain of arnheim

during a pedestrian trip last summer through one or two of the river
counties of new york I found myself as the day declined somewhat
embarrassed about the road I was pursuing the land undulated very
remarkably and my path for the last hour had wound about and about so
confusedly in its effort to keep in the valleys that I no longer knew
in what direction lay the sweet village of b   where I had determined
to stop for the night the sun had scarcely shone strictly
speaking during the day which nevertheless had been unpleasantly
warm a smoky mist resembling that of the indian summer enveloped all
things and of course added to my uncertainty not that I cared much
about the matter if I did not hit upon the village before sunset
or even before dark it was more than possible that a little
dutch farmhouse or something of that kind would soon make its
appearance although in fact the neighborhood perhaps on account of
being more picturesque than fertile was very sparsely inhabited at
all events with my knapsack for a pillow and my hound as a sentry a
bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me
I sauntered on therefore quite at ease ponto taking charge of my
gun until at length just as I had begun to consider whether the
numerous little glades that led hither and thither were intended to
be paths at all I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable
carriage track there could be no mistaking it the traces of light
wheels were evident and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown
undergrowth met overhead there was no obstruction whatever below even
to the passage of a virginian mountain wagon the most aspiring vehicle
I take it of its kind the road however except in being open through
the wood if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of
light trees and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks bore
no resemblance to any road I had before seen the tracks of which i
speak were but faintly perceptible having been impressed upon the firm
yet pleasantly moist surface of what looked more like green genoese
velvet than any thing else it was grass clearly but grass such as we
seldom see out of england so short so thick so even and so vivid in
color not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route not even a chip
or dead twig the stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully
placed not thrown-along the sides of the lane so as to define its
boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise half-negligent and
wholly picturesque definition clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere
luxuriantly in the interspaces

what to make of all this of course I knew not here was art
undoubtedly that did not surprise me all roads in the ordinary sense
are works of art nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the
mere excess of art manifested all that seemed to have been done might
have been done here with such natural capabilities as they have
it in the books on landscape gardening with very little labor and
expense no it was not the amount but the character of the art which
caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and
down this fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered
admiration one thing became more and more evident the longer i
gazed an artist and one with a most scrupulous eye for form had
superintended all these arrangements the greatest care had been taken
to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand
and the pittoresque in the true sense of the italian term on the
other there were few straight and no long uninterrupted lines the
same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice usually but not
oftener at any one point of view everywhere was variety in uniformity
it was a piece of composition in which the most fastidiously critical
taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation

I had turned to the right as I entered this road and now arising i
continued in the same direction the path was so serpentine that at
no moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in
advance its character did not undergo any material change

presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear and in a few
moments afterward as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than
hitherto I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot
of a gentle declivity just before me I could see nothing distinctly on
account of the mist which occupied all the little valley below a gentle
breeze however now arose as the sun was about descending and while
I remained standing on the brow of the slope the fog gradually became
dissipated into wreaths and so floated over the scene

as it came fully into view thus gradually as I describe it piece by
piece here a tree there a glimpse of water and here again the summit
of a chimney I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of
the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of vanishing
pictures

by the time however that the fog had thoroughly disappeared the sun
had made its way down behind the gentle hills and thence as if with
a slight chassez to the south had come again fully into sight glaring
with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the
west suddenly therefore and as if by the hand of magic this whole
valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible

the first coup doeil as the sun slid into the position described
impressed me very much as I have been impressed when a boy by
the concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or
melodrama not even the monstrosity of color was wanting for the
sunlight came out through the chasm tinted all orange and purple while
the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less
upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead
as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly
beautiful

the little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy
could not have been more than four hundred yards long while in breadth
it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred
it was most narrow at its northern extremity opening out as it tended
southwardly but with no very precise regularity the widest portion
was within eighty yards of the southern extreme the slopes which
encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills unless at their
northern face here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of
some ninety feet and as I have mentioned the valley at this point was
not more than fifty feet wide but as the visiter proceeded southwardly
from the cliff he found on his right hand and on his left declivities
at once less high less precipitous and less rocky all in a word
sloped and softened to the south and yet the whole vale was engirdled
by eminences more or less high except at two points one of these i
have already spoken of it lay considerably to the north of west and
was where the setting sun made its way as I have before described into
the amphitheatre through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite
embankment this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest
point so far as the eye could trace it it seemed to lead up up like a
natural causeway into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests
the other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale here
generally the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations
extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards in the
middle of this extent was a depression level with the ordinary floor of
the valley as regards vegetation as well as in respect to every thing
else the scene softened and sloped to the south to the north on the
craggy precipice a few paces from the verge up sprang the magnificent
trunks of numerous hickories black walnuts and chestnuts interspersed
with occasional oak and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the
walnuts especially spread far over the edge of the cliff proceeding
southwardly the explorer saw at first the same class of trees
but less and less lofty and salvatorish in character then he saw the
gentler elm succeeded by the sassafras and locust these again by the
softer linden red-bud catalpa and maple these yet again by still
more graceful and more modest varieties the whole face of the southern
declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone an occasional
silver willow or white poplar excepted in the bottom of the valley
itself for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto
mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides were to be seen three
insulated trees one was an elm of fine size and exquisite form it
stood guard over the southern gate of the vale another was a hickory
much larger than the elm and altogether a much finer tree although
both were exceedingly beautiful it seemed to have taken charge of the
northwestern entrance springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws
of the ravine and throwing its graceful body at an angle of nearly
forty-five degrees far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre about
thirty yards east of this tree stood however the pride of the valley
and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen
unless perhaps among the cypresses of the itchiatuckanee it was a
triple-stemmed tulip-tree the liriodendron tulipiferum one of the
natural order of magnolias its three trunks separated from the parent
at about three feet from the soil and diverging very slightly and
gradually were not more than four feet apart at the point where the
largest stem shot out into foliage this was at an elevation of about
eighty feet the whole height of the principal division was one hundred
and twenty feet nothing can surpass in beauty the form or the glossy
vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree in the present instance
they were fully eight inches wide but their glory was altogether
eclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms conceive
closely congregated a million of the largest and most resplendent
tulips only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would
convey and then the stately grace of the clean delicately-granulated
columnar stems the largest four feet in diameter at twenty from the
ground the innumerable blossoms mingling with those of other trees
scarcely less beautiful although infinitely less majestic filled the
valley with more than arabian perfumes

the general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as
that I had found in the road if anything more deliciously soft thick
velvety and miraculously green it was hard to conceive how all this
beauty had been attained

I have spoken of two openings into the vale from the one to the
northwest issued a rivulet which came gently murmuring and slightly
foaming down the ravine until it dashed against the group of rocks out
of which sprang the insulated hickory here after encircling the tree
it passed on a little to the north of east leaving the tulip tree some
twenty feet to the south and making no decided alteration in its course
until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries
of the valley at this point after a series of sweeps it turned off at
right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it
went until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure although
roughly oval that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale
this lakelet was perhaps a hundred yards in diameter at its widest
part no crystal could be clearer than its waters its bottom which
could be distinctly seen consisted altogether of pebbles brilliantly
white its banks of the emerald grass already described rounded
rather than sloped off into the clear heaven below and so clear was
this heaven so perfectly at times did it reflect all objects above
it that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced
it was a point of no little difficulty to determine the trout and
some other varieties of fish with which this pond seemed to be almost
inconveniently crowded had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish
it was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely
suspended in the air a light birch canoe that lay placidly on the
water was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed
by the most exquisitely polished mirror a small island fairly laughing
with flowers in full bloom and affording little more space than just
enough for a picturesque little building seemingly a fowl-house arose
from the lake not far from its northern shore to which it was connected
by means of an inconceivably light-looking and yet very primitive
bridge it was formed of a single broad and thick plank of the tulip
wood this was forty feet long and spanned the interval between shore
and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch preventing all
oscillation from the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation
of the rivulet which after meandering for perhaps thirty yards
finally passed through the depression already described in the
middle of the southern declivity and tumbling down a sheer precipice of
a hundred feet made its devious and unnoticed way to the hudson

the lake was deep at some points thirty feet but the rivulet seldom
exceeded three while its greatest width was about eight its bottom and
banks were as those of the pond if a defect could have been attributed
in point of picturesqueness it was that of excessive neatness

the expanse of the green turf was relieved here and there by an
occasional showy shrub such as the hydrangea or the common snowball
or the aromatic seringa or more frequently by a clump of geraniums
blossoming gorgeously in great varieties these latter grew in pots
which were carefully buried in the soil so as to give the plants the
appearance of being indigenous besides all this the lawns velvet was
exquisitely spotted with sheep a considerable flock of which roamed
about the vale in company with three tamed deer and a vast number of
brilliantly-plumed ducks a very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant
attendance upon these animals each and all

along the eastern and western cliffs where toward the upper portion of
the amphitheatre the boundaries were more or less precipitous grew ivy
in great profusion so that only here and there could even a glimpse of
the naked rock be obtained the northern precipice in like manner
was almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance some
springing from the soil at the base of the cliff and others from ledges
on its face

the slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little
domain was crowned by a neat stone wall of sufficient height to
prevent the escape of the deer nothing of the fence kind was observable
elsewhere for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed any
stray sheep for example which should attempt to make its way out of
the vale by means of the ravine would find its progress arrested
after a few yards advance by the precipitous ledge of rock over which
tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew near
the domain in short the only ingress or egress was through a gate
occupying a rocky pass in the road a few paces below the point at which
I stopped to reconnoitre the scene

I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the
whole of its course its two general directions as I have said were
first from west to east and then from north to south at the turn the
stream sweeping backward made an almost circular loop so as to form a
peninsula which was very nearly an island and which included about the
sixteenth of an acre on this peninsula stood a dwelling-house and when
I say that this house like the infernal terrace seen by vathek etait
dune architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre I mean
merely that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of
combined novelty and propriety in a word of poetry for than in the
words just employed I could scarcely give of poetry in the abstract
a more rigorous definition and I do not mean that merely outre was
perceptible in any respect

in fact nothing could well be more simple more utterly unpretending
than this cottage its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic
arrangement as a picture I could have fancied while I looked at it
that some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush

the point of view from which I first saw the valley was not altogether
although it was nearly the best point from which to survey the house
I will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it from a position on
the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre

the main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen
broad certainly not more its total height from the ground to the apex
of the roof could not have exceeded eighteen feet to the west end
of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its
proportions the line of its front standing back about two yards from
that of the larger house and the line of its roof of course being
considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining at right angles
to these buildings and from the rear of the main one not exactly in
the middle extended a third compartment very small being in general
one-third less than the western wing the roofs of the two larger were
very steep sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve
and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front so as to
form the roofs of two piazzas these latter roofs of course needed
no support but as they had the air of needing it slight and perfectly
plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone the roof of the
northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof
between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather
slender square chimney of hard dutch bricks alternately black and
red a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top over the gables
the roofs also projected very much in the main building about four
feet to the east and two to the west the principal door was not exactly
in the main division being a little to the east while the two windows
were to the west these latter did not extend to the floor but were
much longer and narrower than usual they had single shutters like
doors the panes were of lozenge form but quite large the door itself
had its upper half of glass also in lozenge panes a movable shutter
secured it at night the door to the west wing was in its gable and
quite simple a single window looked out to the south there was no
external door to the north wing and it also had only one window to the
east

the blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs with a
balustrade running diagonally across it the ascent being from the
south under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access
to a door leading to the garret or rather loft for it was lighted only
by a single window to the north and seemed to have been intended as a
store-room

the piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors as is
usual but at the doors and at each window large flat irregular slabs
of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf affording comfortable
footing in all weather excellent paths of the same material not nicely
adapted but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the
stones led hither and thither from the house to a crystal spring about
five paces off to the road or to one or two out-houses that lay to
the north beyond the brook and were thoroughly concealed by a few
locusts and catalpas

not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the
dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree so clothed from head to foot in
the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to
determine what manner of sweet thing it could be from various arms of
this tree hung cages of different kinds in one a large wicker cylinder
with a ring at top revelled a mocking bird in another an oriole in a
third the impudent bobolink while three or four more delicate prisons
were loudly vocal with canaries

the pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet
honeysuckle while from the angle formed by the main structure and
its west wing in front sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance
scorning all restraint it had clambered first to the lower roof then
to the higher and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe
on throwing out tendrils to the right and left until at length it
fairly attained the east gable and fell trailing over the stairs

the whole house with its wings was constructed of the old-fashioned
dutch shingles broad and with unrounded corners it is a peculiarity
of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being
wider at bottom than at top after the manner of egyptian architecture
and in the present instance this exceedingly picturesque effect was
aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the
base of the buildings

the shingles were painted a dull gray and the happiness with which this
neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that
partially overshadowed the cottage can readily be conceived by an
artist

from the position near the stone wall as described the buildings
were seen at great advantage for the southeastern angle was thrown
forward so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts
with the picturesque eastern gable and at the same time obtained just a
sufficient glimpse of the northern wing with parts of a pretty roof
to the spring-house and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the
brook in the near vicinity of the main buildings

I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill although long enough
to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet it was clear that
I had wandered from the road to the village and I had thus good
travellers excuse to open the gate before me and inquire my way at
all events so without more ado I proceeded

the road after passing the gate seemed to lie upon a natural ledge
sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs it
led me on to the foot of the northern precipice and thence over the
bridge round by the eastern gable to the front door in this progress
I took notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained

as I turned the corner of the gable the mastiff bounded towards me in
stern silence but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger I held him
out my hand however in token of amity and I never yet knew the dog
who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy he not only
shut his mouth and wagged his tail but absolutely offered me his
paw afterward extending his civilities to ponto

as no bell was discernible I rapped with my stick against the
door which stood half open instantly a figure advanced to the
threshold that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of
age slender or rather slight and somewhat above the medium height
as she approached with a certain modest decision of step altogether
indescribable I said to myself surely here I have found the
perfection of natural in contradistinction from artificial grace the
second impression which she made on me but by far the more vivid of
the two was that of enthusiasm so intense an expression of romance
perhaps I should call it or of unworldliness as that which gleamed
from her deep-set eyes had never so sunk into my heart of hearts
before I know not how it is but this peculiar expression of the eye
wreathing itself occasionally into the lips is the most powerful
if not absolutely the sole spell which rivets my interest in woman
romance provided my readers fully comprehended what I would here imply
by the word romance and womanliness seem to me convertible terms
and after all what man truly loves in woman is simply her womanhood
the eyes of annie I heard some one from the interior call her annie
darling were spiritual grey her hair a light chestnut this is
all I had time to observe of her

at her most courteous of invitations I entered passing first into a
tolerably wide vestibule having come mainly to observe I took notice
that to my right as I stepped in was a window such as those in front
of the house to the left a door leading into the principal room
while opposite me an open door enabled me to see a small apartment
just the size of the vestibule arranged as a study and having a large
bow window looking out to the north

passing into the parlor I found myself with mr landor for this
I afterwards found was his name he was civil even cordial in his
manner but just then I was more intent on observing the arrangements
of the dwelling which had so much interested me than the personal
appearance of the tenant

the north wing I now saw was a bed-chamber its door opened into the
parlor west of this door was a single window looking toward the brook
at the west end of the parlor were a fireplace and a door leading into
the west wing probably a kitchen

nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the
parlor on the floor was an ingrain carpet of excellent texture a
white ground spotted with small circular green figures at the windows
were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin they were tolerably full
and hung decisively perhaps rather formally in sharp parallel plaits
to the floor just to the floor the walls were prepared with a french
paper of great delicacy a silver ground with a faint green cord
running zig-zag throughout its expanse was relieved merely by three
of juliens exquisite lithographs a trois crayons fastened to the wall
without frames one of these drawings was a scene of oriental luxury or
rather voluptuousness another was a carnival piece spirited
beyond compare the third was a greek female head a face so divinely
beautiful and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate never
before arrested my attention

the more substantial furniture consisted of a round table a few chairs
including a large rocking-chair and a sofa or rather settee its
material was plain maple painted a creamy white slightly interstriped
with green the seat of cane the chairs and table were to match but
the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which
planned the grounds it is impossible to conceive anything more
graceful

on the table were a few books a large square crystal bottle of some
novel perfume a plain ground-glass astral not solar lamp with an
italian shade and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers
flowers indeed of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole
mere decoration of the apartment the fire-place was nearly filled with
a vase of brilliant geranium on a triangular shelf in each angle of the
room stood also a similar vase varied only as to its lovely contents
one or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel and late violets
clustered about the open windows

it is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail a
picture of mr landors residence as I found it how he made it what it
was and why with some particulars of mr landor himself may possibly
form the subject of another article

    what say of it what say of conscience grim
    that spectre in my path

                   chamberlaynes pharronida

let me call myself for the present william wilson the fair page now
lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation this has
been already too much an object for the scorn for the horror for the
detestation of my race to the uttermost regions of the globe have not
the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy oh outcast of all
outcasts most abandoned to the earth art thou not forever dead to its
honors to its flowers to its golden aspirations and a cloud dense
dismal and limitless does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and
heaven

I would not if I could here or to-day embody a record of my later
years of unspeakable misery and unpardonable crime this epoch these
later years took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude whose
origin alone it is my present purpose to assign men usually grow base
by degrees from me in an instant all virtue dropped bodily as a
mantle from comparatively trivial wickedness I passed with the stride
of a giant into more than the enormities of an elah-gabalus what
chance what one event brought this evil thing to pass bear with me
while I relate death approaches and the shadow which foreruns him has
thrown a softening influence over my spirit I long in passing through
the dim valley for the sympathy I had nearly said for the pity of
my fellow men I would fain have them believe that I have been in some
measure the slave of circumstances beyond human control I would wish
them to seek out for me in the details I am about to give some
little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error I would have them
allow what they cannot refrain from allowing that although temptation
may have erewhile existed as great man was never thus at least
tempted before certainly never thus fell and is it therefore that he
has never thus suffered have I not indeed been living in a dream and
am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest
of all sublunary visions

I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable
temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable and in my
earliest infancy I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family
character as I advanced in years it was more strongly developed
becoming for many reasons a cause of serious disquietude to my
friends and of positive injury to myself I grew self-willed addicted
to the wildest caprices and a prey to the most ungovernable passions
weak-minded and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own
my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which
distinguished me some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in
complete failure on their part and of course in total triumph on
mine thenceforward my voice was a household law and at an age when
few children have abandoned their leading-strings I was left to the
guidance of my own will and became in all but name the master of my
own actions

my earliest recollections of a school-life are connected with a large
rambling elizabethan house in a misty-looking village of england
where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees and where all
the houses were excessively ancient in truth it was a dream-like
and spirit-soothing place that venerable old town at this moment in
fancy I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues
inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies and thrill anew
with undefinable delight at the deep hollow note of the church-bell
breaking each hour with sullen and sudden roar upon the stillness of
the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted gothic steeple lay imbedded
and asleep

it gives me perhaps as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner
experience to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its
concerns steeped in misery as I am misery alas only too real i
shall be pardoned for seeking relief however slight and temporary
in the weakness of a few rambling details these moreover utterly
trivial and even ridiculous in themselves assume to my fancy
adventitious importance as connected with a period and a locality when
and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which
afterwards so fully overshadowed me let me then remember

the house I have said was old and irregular the grounds were
extensive and a high and solid brick wall topped with a bed of mortar
and broken glass encompassed the whole this prison-like rampart formed
the limit of our domain beyond it we saw but thrice a week once every
saturday afternoon when attended by two ushers we were permitted to
take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields and
twice during sunday when we were paraded in the same formal manner to
the morning and evening service in the one church of the village of
this church the principal of our school was pastor with how deep a
spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote
pew in the gallery as with step solemn and slow he ascended the
pulpit this reverend man with countenance so demurely benign
with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing with wig so minutely
powdered so rigid and so vast -could this be he who of late with
sour visage and in snuffy habiliments administered ferule in hand
the draconian laws of the academy oh gigantic paradox too utterly
monstrous for solution

at an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate it was
riveted and studded with iron bolts and surmounted with jagged iron
spikes what impressions of deep awe did it inspire it was never
opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already
mentioned then in every creak of its mighty hinges we found a
plenitude of mystery a world of matter for solemn remark or for more
solemn meditation

the extensive enclosure was irregular in form having many capacious
recesses of these three or four of the largest constituted the
play-ground it was level and covered with fine hard gravel I well
remember it had no trees nor benches nor anything similar within
it of course it was in the rear of the house in front lay a small
parterre planted with box and other shrubs but through this sacred
division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed such as a first
advent to school or final departure thence or perhaps when a parent
or friend having called for us we joyfully took our way home for the
christmas or midsummer holy-days

but the house how quaint an old building was this to me how
veritably a palace of enchantment there was really no end to its
windings to its incomprehensible subdivisions it was difficult at
any given time to say with certainty upon which of its two stories
one happened to be from each room to every other there were sure to be
found three or four steps either in ascent or descent then the lateral
branches were innumerable inconceivable and so returning in upon
themselves that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion
were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon
infinity during the five years of my residence here I was never able
to ascertain with precision in what remote locality lay the little
sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other
scholars

the school-room was the largest in the house I could not help thinking
in the world it was very long narrow and dismally low with pointed
gothic windows and a ceiling of oak in a remote and terror-inspiring
angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet comprising the
sanctum during hours of our principal the reverend dr bransby it
was a solid structure with massy door sooner than open which in the
absence of the dominic we would all have willingly perished by the
peine forte et dure in other angles were two other similar boxes far
less reverenced indeed but still greatly matters of awe one of
these was the pulpit of the classical usher one of the english and
mathematical interspersed about the room crossing and recrossing
in endless irregularity were innumerable benches and desks black
ancient and time-worn piled desperately with much-bethumbed books
and so beseamed with initial letters names at full length grotesque
figures and other multiplied efforts of the knife as to have entirely
lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days
long departed a huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the
room and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other

encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy I passed yet
not in tedium or disgust the years of the third lustrum of my life
the teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to
occupy or amuse it and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was
replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived
from luxury or my full manhood from crime yet I must believe that my
first mental development had in it much of the uncommon even much of
the outre upon mankind at large the events of very early existence
rarely leave in mature age any definite impression all is gray
shadow a weak and irregular remembrance an indistinct regathering of
feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains with me this is not so in
childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find
stamped upon memory in lines as vivid as deep and as durable as the
exergues of the carthaginian medals

yet in fact in the fact of the worlds view how little was there
to remember the mornings awakening the nightly summons to bed
the connings the recitations the periodical half-holidays and
perambulations the play-ground with its broils its pastimes its
intrigues these by a mental sorcery long forgotten were made to
involve a wilderness of sensation a world of rich incident an
universe of varied emotion of excitement the most passionate and
spirit-stirring oh le bon temps que ce siecle de fer

in truth the ardor the enthusiasm and the imperiousness of my
disposition soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates
and by slow but natural gradations gave me an ascendancy over all
not greatly older than myself over all with a single exception
this exception was found in the person of a scholar who although
no relation bore the same christian and surname as myself a
circumstance in fact little remarkable for notwithstanding a noble
descent mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem by
prescriptive right to have been time out of mind the common property
of the mob in this narrative I have therefore designated myself as
william wilson a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real
my namesake alone of those who in school phraseology constituted our
set presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class in the
sports and broils of the play-ground to refuse implicit belief in my
assertions and submission to my will indeed to interfere with my
arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever if there is on earth a
supreme and unqualified despotism it is the despotism of a master mind
in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions

wilsons rebellion was to me a source of the greatest
embarrassment the more so as in spite of the bravado with which in
public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions I secretly
felt that I feared him and could not help thinking the equality which
he maintained so easily with myself a proof of his true superiority
since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle yet this
superiority even this equality was in truth acknowledged by no one but
myself our associates by some unaccountable blindness seemed not even
to suspect it indeed his competition his resistance and especially
his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes were not more
pointed than private he appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition
which urged and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to
excel in his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a
whimsical desire to thwart astonish or mortify myself although there
were times when I could not help observing with a feeling made up of
wonder abasement and pique that he mingled with his injuries his
insults or his contradictions a certain most inappropriate and
assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner I could only
conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit
assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection

perhaps it was this latter trait in wilsons conduct conjoined with our
identity of name and the mere accident of our having entered the school
upon the same day which set afloat the notion that we were brothers
among the senior classes in the academy these do not usually inquire
with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors I have before
said or should have said that wilson was not in the most remote
degree connected with my family but assuredly if we had been brothers
we must have been twins for after leaving dr bransbys I casually
learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of january
 and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence for the day is
precisely that of my own nativity

it may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me
by the rivalry of wilson and his intolerable spirit of contradiction
I could not bring myself to hate him altogether we had to be sure
nearly every day a quarrel in which yielding me publicly the palm of
victory he in some manner contrived to make me feel that it was he
who had deserved it yet a sense of pride on my part and a veritable
dignity on his own kept us always upon what are called speaking
terms while there were many points of strong congeniality in our
tempers operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone
perhaps prevented from ripening into friendship it is difficult
indeed to define or even to describe my real feelings towards
him they formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture some petulant
animosity which was not yet hatred some esteem more respect much
fear with a world of uneasy curiosity to the moralist it will be
unnecessary to say in addition that wilson and myself were the most
inseparable of companions

it was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us
which turned all my attacks upon him and they were many either open
or covert into the channel of banter or practical joke giving pain
while assuming the aspect of mere fun rather than into a more serious
and determined hostility but my endeavours on this head were by no
means uniformly successful even when my plans were the most wittily
concocted for my namesake had much about him in character of that
unassuming and quiet austerity which while enjoying the poignancy of
its own jokes has no heel of achilles in itself and absolutely refuses
to be laughed at I could find indeed but one vulnerable point
and that lying in a personal peculiarity arising perhaps from
constitutional disease would have been spared by any antagonist less
at his wits end than myself my rival had a weakness in the faucal or
guttural organs which precluded him from raising his voice at any time
above a very low whisper of this defect I did not fail to take what
poor advantage lay in my power

wilsons retaliations in kind were many and there was one form of his
practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure how his sagacity first
discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me is a question i
never could solve but having discovered he habitually practised the
annoyance I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic and
its very common if not plebeian praenomen the words were venom in my
ears and when upon the day of my arrival a second william wilson came
also to the academy I felt angry with him for bearing the name and
doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it who would
be the cause of its twofold repetition who would be constantly in my
presence and whose concerns in the ordinary routine of the school
business must inevitably on account of the detestable coincidence be
often confounded with my own

the feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every
circumstance tending to show resemblance moral or physical between my
rival and myself I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we
were of the same age but I saw that we were of the same height and
I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of
person and outline of feature I was galled too by the rumor touching
a relationship which had grown current in the upper forms in a word
nothing could more seriously disturb me although I scrupulously
concealed such disturbance than any allusion to a similarity of mind
person or condition existing between us but in truth I had no reason
to believe that with the exception of the matter of relationship and
in the case of wilson himself this similarity had ever been made a
subject of comment or even observed at all by our schoolfellows that
he observed it in all its bearings and as fixedly as I was apparent
but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of
annoyance can only be attributed as I said before to his more than
ordinary penetration

his cue which was to perfect an imitation of myself lay both in words
and in actions and most admirably did he play his part my dress it
was an easy matter to copy my gait and general manner were without
difficulty appropriated in spite of his constitutional defect even my
voice did not escape him my louder tones were of course unattempted
but then the key it was identical and his singular whisper it grew
the very echo of my own

how greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me for it could
not justly be termed a caricature I will not now venture to describe
I had but one consolation in the fact that the imitation apparently
was noticed by myself alone and that I had to endure only the knowing
and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself satisfied with
having produced in my bosom the intended effect he seemed to chuckle
in secret over the sting he had inflicted and was characteristically
disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty
endeavours might have so easily elicited that the school indeed did
not feel his design perceive its accomplishment and participate in
his sneer was for many anxious months a riddle I could not
resolve perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily
perceptible or more possibly I owed my security to the master air of
the copyist who disdaining the letter which in a painting is all
the obtuse can see gave but the full spirit of his original for my
individual contemplation and chagrin

I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage
which he assumed toward me and of his frequent officious interference
with my will this interference often took the ungracious character of
advice advice not openly given but hinted or insinuated I received it
with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years yet at this
distant day let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can
recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side
of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming
inexperience that his moral sense at least if not his general talents
and worldly wisdom was far keener than my own and that I might
to-day have been a better and thus a happier man had I less
frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers
which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised

as it was I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful
supervision and daily resented more and more openly what I considered
his intolerable arrogance I have said that in the first years of our
connexion as schoolmates my feelings in regard to him might have
been easily ripened into friendship but in the latter months of my
residence at the academy although the intrusion of his ordinary manner
had beyond doubt in some measure abated my sentiments in nearly
similar proportion partook very much of positive hatred upon one
occasion he saw this I think and afterwards avoided or made a show of
avoiding me

it was about the same period if I remember aright that in an
altercation of violence with him in which he was more than usually
thrown off his guard and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor
rather foreign to his nature I discovered or fancied I discovered
in his accent his air and general appearance a something which first
startled and then deeply interested me by bringing to mind dim visions
of my earliest infancy wild confused and thronging memories of a
time when memory herself was yet unborn I cannot better describe the
sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty
shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who
stood before me at some epoch very long ago some point of the past
even infinitely remote the delusion however faded rapidly as it came
and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation i
there held with my singular namesake

the huge old house with its countless subdivisions had several large
chambers communicating with each other where slept the greater number
of the students there were however as must necessarily happen in a
building so awkwardly planned many little nooks or recesses the
odds and ends of the structure and these the economic ingenuity of dr
bransby had also fitted up as dormitories although being the merest
closets they were capable of accommodating but a single individual one
of these small apartments was occupied by wilson

one night about the close of my fifth year at the school and
immediately after the altercation just mentioned finding every one
wrapped in sleep I arose from bed and lamp in hand stole through a
wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival i
had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit
at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful
it was my intention now to put my scheme in operation and I resolved
to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued
having reached his closet I noiselessly entered leaving the lamp with
a shade over it on the outside I advanced a step and listened to
the sound of his tranquil breathing assured of his being asleep i
returned took the light and with it again approached the bed close
curtains were around it which in the prosecution of my plan i
slowly and quietly withdrew when the bright rays fell vividly upon
the sleeper and my eyes at the same moment upon his countenance i
looked and a numbness an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my
frame my breast heaved my knees tottered my whole spirit became
possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror gasping for
breath I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face were
these these the lineaments of william wilson I saw indeed that they
were his but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they
were not what was there about them to confound me in this manner i
gazed while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts
not thus he appeared assuredly not thus in the vivacity of his waking
hours the same name the same contour of person the same day of
arrival at the academy and then his dogged and meaningless imitation
of my gait my voice my habits and my manner was it in truth within
the bounds of human possibility that what I now saw was the result
merely of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation
awe-stricken and with a creeping shudder I extinguished the lamp
passed silently from the chamber and left at once the halls of that
old academy never to enter them again

after a lapse of some months spent at home in mere idleness I found
myself a student at eton the brief interval had been sufficient to
enfeeble my remembrance of the events at dr bransbys or at least
to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which
I remembered them the truth the tragedy of the drama was no more
I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses and seldom
called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human
credulity and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which i
hereditarily possessed neither was this species of scepticism likely to
be diminished by the character of the life I led at eton the vortex of
thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly
plunged washed away all but the froth of my past hours engulfed at
once every solid or serious impression and left to memory only the
veriest levities of a former existence

I do not wish however to trace the course of my miserable profligacy
here a profligacy which set at defiance the laws while it eluded
the vigilance of the institution three years of folly passed without
profit had but given me rooted habits of vice and added in a somewhat
unusual degree to my bodily stature when after a week of soulless
dissipation I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a
secret carousal in my chambers we met at a late hour of the night for
our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning the
wine flowed freely and there were not wanting other and perhaps more
dangerous seductions so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared
in the east while our delirious extravagance was at its height madly
flushed with cards and intoxication I was in the act of insisting upon
a toast of more than wonted profanity when my attention was suddenly
diverted by the violent although partial unclosing of the door of the
apartment and by the eager voice of a servant from without he said
that some person apparently in great haste demanded to speak with me
in the hall

wildly excited with wine the unexpected interruption rather delighted
than surprised me I staggered forward at once and a few steps brought
me to the vestibule of the building in this low and small room there
hung no lamp and now no light at all was admitted save that of the
exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular
window as I put my foot over the threshold I became aware of the
figure of a youth about my own height and habited in a white kerseymere
morning frock cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the
moment this the faint light enabled me to perceive but the features of
his face I could not distinguish upon my entering he strode hurriedly
up to me and seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant
impatience whispered the words william wilson in my ear

I grew perfectly sober in an instant there was that in the manner of
the stranger and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger as he
held it between my eyes and the light which filled me with unqualified
amazement but it was not this which had so violently moved me it
was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular low hissing
utterance and above all it was the character the tone the key of
those few simple and familiar yet whispered syllables which came
with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days and struck upon my
soul with the shock of a galvanic battery ere I could recover the use
of my senses he was gone

although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered
imagination yet was it evanescent as vivid for some weeks indeed i
busied myself in earnest inquiry or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid
speculation I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the
identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered
with my affairs and harassed me with his insinuated counsel but
who and what was this wilson and whence came he and what were his
purposes upon neither of these points could I be satisfied merely
ascertaining in regard to him that a sudden accident in his family had
caused his removal from dr bransbys academy on the afternoon of the
day in which I myself had eloped but in a brief period I ceased
to think upon the subject my attention being all absorbed in
a contemplated departure for oxford thither I soon went the
uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and
annual establishment which would enable me to indulge at will in
the luxury already so dear to my heart to vie in profuseness of
expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in
great britain

excited by such appliances to vice my constitutional temperament broke
forth with redoubled ardor and I spurned even the common restraints of
decency in the mad infatuation of my revels but it were absurd to
pause in the detail of my extravagance let it suffice that among
spendthrifts I out-heroded herod and that giving name to a multitude
of novel follies I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of
vices then usual in the most dissolute university of europe

it could hardly be credited however that I had even here so utterly
fallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek acquaintance with the
vilest arts of the gambler by profession and having become an adept
in his despicable science to practise it habitually as a means of
increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded
among my fellow-collegians such nevertheless was the fact and the
very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment
proved beyond doubt the main if not the sole reason of the impunity
with which it was committed who indeed among my most abandoned
associates would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his
senses than have suspected of such courses the gay the frank the
generous william wilson the noblest and most liberal commoner at oxford him
whose follies said his parasites were but the follies of youth and
unbridled fancy whose errors but inimitable whim whose darkest vice
but a careless and dashing extravagance

I had been now two years successfully busied in this way when there
came to the university a young parvenu nobleman glendinning rich said
report as herodes atticus his riches too as easily acquired I soon
found him of weak intellect and of course marked him as a fitting
subject for my skill I frequently engaged him in play and contrived
with the gamblers usual art to let him win considerable sums the more
effectually to entangle him in my snares at length my schemes being
ripe I met him with the full intention that this meeting should be
final and decisive at the chambers of a fellow-commoner mr preston
equally intimate with both but who to do him justice entertained
not even a remote suspicion of my design to give to this a better
colouring I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or
ten and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should
appear accidental and originate in the proposal of my contemplated
dupe himself to be brief upon a vile topic none of the low finesse was
omitted so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter
for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim

we had protracted our sitting far into the night and I had at length
effected the manoeuvre of getting glendinning as my sole antagonist the
game too was my favorite ecarte the rest of the company interested
in the extent of our play had abandoned their own cards and were
standing around us as spectators the parvenu who had been induced
by my artifices in the early part of the evening to drink deeply now
shuffled dealt or played with a wild nervousness of manner for which
his intoxication I thought might partially but could not altogether
account in a very short period he had become my debtor to a large
amount when having taken a long draught of port he did precisely
what I had been coolly anticipating he proposed to double our already
extravagant stakes with a well-feigned show of reluctance and not
until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words
which gave a color of pique to my compliance did I finally comply the
result of course did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils
in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt for some time his
countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine but
now to my astonishment I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly
fearful I say to my astonishment glendinning had been represented to
my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy and the sums which he had
as yet lost although in themselves vast could not I supposed very
seriously annoy much less so violently affect him that he was overcome
by the wine just swallowed was the idea which most readily presented
itself and rather with a view to the preservation of my own character
in the eyes of my associates than from any less interested motive i
was about to insist peremptorily upon a discontinuance of the play
when some expressions at my elbow from among the company and an
ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of glendinning gave me
to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances
which rendering him an object for the pity of all should have
protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend

what now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say the pitiable
condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all
and for some moments a profound silence was maintained during which i
could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances
of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party
I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a
brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary
interruption which ensued the wide heavy folding doors of the
apartment were all at once thrown open to their full extent with a
vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished as if by magic
every candle in the room their light in dying enabled us just to
perceive that a stranger had entered about my own height and closely
muffled in a cloak the darkness however was now total and we could
only feel that he was standing in our midst before any one of us could
recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had
thrown all we heard the voice of the intruder

gentlemen he said in a low distinct and never-to-be-forgotten
whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones gentlemen i
make no apology for this behaviour because in thus behaving I am
but fulfilling a duty you are beyond doubt uninformed of the true
character of the person who has to-night won at ecarte a large sum
of money from lord glendinning I will therefore put you upon an
expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary
information please to examine at your leisure the inner linings of
the cuff of his left sleeve and the several little packages which may
be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning
wrapper

while he spoke so profound was the stillness that one might have heard
a pin drop upon the floor in ceasing he departed at once and as
abruptly as he had entered can I shall I describe my sensations must
I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned most assuredly I had
little time given for reflection many hands roughly seized me upon the
spot and lights were immediately reprocured a search ensued in the
lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte
and in the pockets of my wrapper a number of packs facsimiles of
those used at our sittings with the single exception that mine were of
the species called technically arrondees the honours being slightly
convex at the ends the lower cards slightly convex at the sides in
this disposition the dupe who cuts as customary at the length of the
pack will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor while
the gambler cutting at the breadth will as certainly cut nothing for
his victim which may count in the records of the game

any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less
than the silent contempt or the sarcastic composure with which it was
received

mr wilson said our host stooping to remove from beneath his feet
an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs mr wilson this is your
property the weather was cold and upon quitting my own room I had
thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper putting it off upon reaching
the scene of play I presume it is supererogatory to seek here eyeing
the folds of the garment with a bitter smile for any farther evidence
of your skill indeed we have had enough you will see the necessity
I hope of quitting oxford at all events of quitting instantly my
chambers

abased humbled to the dust as I then was it is probable that I should
have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence had
not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the
most startling character the cloak which I had worn was of a rare
description of fur how rare how extravagantly costly I shall not
venture to say its fashion too was of my own fantastic invention for
I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry in matters of this
frivolous nature when therefore mr preston reached me that which
he had picked up upon the floor and near the folding doors of the
apartment it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror
that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm where I had no doubt
unwittingly placed it and that the one presented me was but its exact
counterpart in every in even the minutest possible particular the
singular being who had so disastrously exposed me had been muffled
I remembered in a cloak and none had been worn at all by any of
the members of our party with the exception of myself retaining some
presence of mind I took the one offered me by preston placed it
unnoticed over my own left the apartment with a resolute scowl of
defiance and next morning ere dawn of day commenced a hurried journey
from oxford to the continent in a perfect agony of horror and of shame

I fled in vain my evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation and
proved indeed that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet
only begun scarcely had I set foot in paris ere I had fresh evidence of
the detestable interest taken by this wilson in my concerns years flew
while I experienced no relief villain at rome with how untimely
yet with how spectral an officiousness stepped he in between me and my
ambition at vienna too at berlin and at moscow where in truth had
I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart from his inscrutable
tyranny did I at length flee panic-stricken as from a pestilence and
to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain

and again and again in secret communion with my own spirit would
I demand the questions who is he whence came he and what are his
objects but no answer was there found and then I scrutinized with a
minute scrutiny the forms and the methods and the leading traits of
his impertinent supervision but even here there was very little upon
which to base a conjecture it was noticeable indeed that in no one
of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path had
he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes or to disturb those
actions which if fully carried out might have resulted in bitter
mischief poor justification this in truth for an authority so
imperiously assumed poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so
pertinaciously so insultingly denied

I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor for a very long
period of time while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity
maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself had so
contrived it in the execution of his varied interference with my will
that I saw not at any moment the features of his face be wilson what
he might this at least was but the veriest of affectation or of
folly could he for an instant have supposed that in my admonisher
at eton in the destroyer of my honor at oxford in him who thwarted my
ambition at rome my revenge at paris my passionate love at naples or
what he falsely termed my avarice in egypt that in this my arch-enemy
and evil genius could fail to recognise the william wilson of my
school boy days the namesake the companion the rival the hated and
dreaded rival at dr bransbys impossible but let me hasten to the
last eventful scene of the drama

thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination the
sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated
character the majestic wisdom the apparent omnipresence and
omnipotence of wilson added to a feeling of even terror with which
certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me had
operated hitherto to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness
and helplessness and to suggest an implicit although bitterly
reluctant submission to his arbitrary will but of late days I had
given myself up entirely to wine and its maddening influence upon my
hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control i
began to murmur to hesitate to resist and was it only fancy which
induced me to believe that with the increase of my own firmness that
of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution be this as it may
I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope and at length
nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that i
would submit no longer to be enslaved

it was at rome during the carnival of   that I attended a
masquerade in the palazzo of the neapolitan duke dI broglio I had
indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table and
now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond
endurance the difficulty too of forcing my way through the mazes of
the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper for
I was anxiously seeking let me not say with what unworthy motive the
young the gay the beautiful wife of the aged and doting dI broglio
with a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me
the secret of the costume in which she would be habited and now having
caught a glimpse of her person I was hurrying to make my way into her
presence at this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder
and that ever-remembered low damnable whisper within my ear

in an absolute phrenzy of wrath I turned at once upon him who had thus
interrupted me and seized him violently by the collar he was attired
as I had expected in a costume altogether similar to my own wearing a
spanish cloak of blue velvet begirt about the waist with a crimson belt
sustaining a rapier a mask of black silk entirely covered his face

scoundrel I said in a voice husky with rage while every syllable
I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury scoundrel impostor accursed
villain you shall not you shall not dog me unto death follow me or i
stab you where you stand and I broke my way from the ball-room into
a small ante-chamber adjoining dragging him unresistingly with me as i
went

upon entering I thrust him furiously from me he staggered against the
wall while I closed the door with an oath and commanded him to draw
he hesitated but for an instant then with a slight sigh drew in
silence and put himself upon his defence

the contest was brief indeed I was frantic with every species of wild
excitement and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a
multitude in a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the
wainscoting and thus getting him at mercy plunged my sword with
brute ferocity repeatedly through and through his bosom

at that instant some person tried the latch of the door I hastened
to prevent an intrusion and then immediately returned to my dying
antagonist but what human language can adequately portray that
astonishment that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then
presented to view the brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been
sufficient to produce apparently a material change in the arrangements
at the upper or farther end of the room a large mirror so at first it
seemed to me in my confusion now stood where none had been perceptible
before and as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror mine own
image but with features all pale and dabbled in blood advanced to meet
me with a feeble and tottering gait

thus it appeared I say but was not it was my antagonist it was
wilson who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution
his mask and cloak lay where he had thrown them upon the floor not
a thread in all his raiment not a line in all the marked and singular
lineaments of his face which was not even in the most absolute
identity mine own

it was wilson but he spoke no longer in a whisper and I could have
fancied that I myself was speaking while he said

you have conquered and I yield yet henceforward art thou also
dead dead to the world to heaven and to hope in me didst thou
exist and in my death see by this image which is thine own how
utterly thou hast murdered thyself




the tell-tale heart

true nervous very very dreadfully nervous I had been and am but
why will you say that I am mad the disease had sharpened my senses not
destroyed not dulled them above all was the sense of hearing acute i
heard all things in the heaven and in the earth I heard many things
in hell how then am I mad hearken and observe how healthily how
calmly I can tell you the whole story

it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain but once
conceived it haunted me day and night object there was none passion
there was none I loved the old man he had never wronged me he had
never given me insult for his gold I had no desire I think it was his
eye yes it was this he had the eye of a vulture a pale blue eye
with a film over it whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold and
so by degrees very gradually I made up my mind to take the life of the
old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever

now this is the point you fancy me mad madmen know nothing but you
should have seen me you should have seen how wisely I proceeded with
what caution with what foresight with what dissimulation I went to
work I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week
before I killed him and every night about midnight I turned the latch
of his door and opened it oh so gently and then when I had made an
opening sufficient for my head I put in a dark lantern all closed
closed that no light shone out and then I thrust in my head oh
you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in I moved it
slowly very very slowly so that I might not disturb the old mans
sleep it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so
far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed ha would a madman have
been so wise as this and then when my head was well in the room i
undid the lantern cautiously oh so cautiously cautiously for the
hinges creaked I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell
upon the vulture eye and this I did for seven long nights every night
just at midnight but I found the eye always closed and so it was
impossible to do the work for it was not the old man who vexed me but
his evil eye and every morning when the day broke I went boldly into
the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name in a
hearty tone and inquiring how he has passed the night so you see he
would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every
night just at twelve I looked in upon him while he slept

upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the
door a watchs minute hand moves more quickly than did mine never
before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of my
sagacity I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph to think
that there I was opening the door little by little and he not even to
dream of my secret deeds or thoughts I fairly chuckled at the idea and
perhaps he heard me for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled
now you may think that I drew back but no his room was as black as
pitch with the thick darkness for the shutters were close fastened
through fear of robbers and so I knew that he could not see the
opening of the door and I kept pushing it on steadily steadily

I had my head in and was about to open the lantern when my thumb
slipped upon the tin fastening and the old man sprang up in bed crying
out whos there

I kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour I did not move a
muscle and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down he was still
sitting up in the bed listening just as I have done night after
night hearkening to the death watches in the wall

presently I heard a slight groan and I knew it was the groan of mortal
terror it was not a groan of pain or of grief oh no it was the low
stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged
with awe I knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when
all the world slept it has welled up from my own bosom deepening with
its dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me I say I knew it well
I knew what the old man felt and pitied him although I chuckled at
heart I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight
noise when he had turned in the bed his fears had been ever since
growing upon him he had been trying to fancy them causeless but could
not he had been saying to himself it is nothing but the wind in the
chimney it is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a
cricket which has made a single chirp yes he had been trying to
comfort himself with these suppositions but he had found all in vain
all in vain because death in approaching him had stalked with his
black shadow before him and enveloped the victim and it was the
mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to
feel although he neither saw nor heard to feel the presence of my head
within the room

when I had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie
down I resolved to open a little a very very little crevice in
the lantern so I opened it you cannot imagine how stealthily
stealthily until at length a simple dim ray like the thread of the
spider shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye

it was open wide wide open and I grew furious as I gazed upon it i
saw it with perfect distinctness all a dull blue with a hideous
veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones but I could see
nothing else of the old mans face or person for I had directed the ray
as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot

and have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but
over-acuteness of the sense now I say there came to my ears a low
dull quick sound such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i
knew that sound well too it was the beating of the old mans heart it
increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into
courage

but even yet I refrained and kept still I scarcely breathed I held the
lantern motionless I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon
the eve meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased it grew
quicker and quicker and louder and louder every instant the old mans
terror must have been extreme it grew louder I say louder every
moment do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous so I am
and now at the dead hour of the night amid the dreadful silence of
that old house so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable
terror yet for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still but
the beating grew louder louder I thought the heart must burst and now
a new anxiety seized me the sound would be heard by a neighbour the
old mans hour had come with a loud yell I threw open the lantern
and leaped into the room he shrieked once once only in an instant
I dragged him to the floor and pulled the heavy bed over him I then
smiled gaily to find the deed so far done but for many minutes the
heart beat on with a muffled sound this however did not vex me it
would not be heard through the wall at length it ceased the old man
was dead I removed the bed and examined the corpse yes he was stone
stone dead I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many
minutes there was no pulsation he was stone dead his eye would
trouble me no more

if still you think me mad you will think so no longer when I describe
the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body the night
waned and I worked hastily but in silence first of all I dismembered
the corpse I cut off the head and the arms and the legs

I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber and
deposited all between the scantlings I then replaced the boards so
cleverly so cunningly that no human eye not even his could have
detected any thing wrong there was nothing to wash out no stain of any
kind no blood-spot whatever I had been too wary for that a tub had
caught all ha ha

when I had made an end of these labors it was four oclock still dark
as midnight as the bell sounded the hour there came a knocking at the
street door I went down to open it with a light heart for what had
I now to fear there entered three men who introduced themselves with
perfect suavity as officers of the police a shriek had been heard by
a neighbour during the night suspicion of foul play had been aroused
information had been lodged at the police office and they the
officers had been deputed to search the premises

I smiled for what had I to fear I bade the gentlemen welcome the
shriek I said was my own in a dream the old man I mentioned was
absent in the country I took my visitors all over the house I bade
them search search well I led them at length to his chamber i
showed them his treasures secure undisturbed in the enthusiasm of
my confidence I brought chairs into the room and desired them here
to rest from their fatigues while I myself in the wild audacity of
my perfect triumph placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which
reposed the corpse of the victim

the officers were satisfied my manner had convinced them I was
singularly at ease they sat and while I answered cheerily they
chatted of familiar things but ere long I felt myself getting pale
and wished them gone my head ached and I fancied a ringing in my
ears but still they sat and still chatted the ringing became more
distinct it continued and became more distinct I talked more
freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued and gained
definiteness until at length I found that the noise was not within my
ears

no doubt I now grew very pale but I talked more fluently and with a
heightened voice yet the sound increased and what could I do it was
a low dull quick sound much such a sound as a watch makes when
enveloped in cotton I gasped for breath and yet the officers heard
it not I talked more quickly more vehemently but the noise steadily
increased I arose and argued about trifles in a high key and with
violent gesticulations but the noise steadily increased why would
they not be gone I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides as if
excited to fury by the observations of the men but the noise steadily
increased oh god what could I do I foamed I raved I swore I swung
the chair upon which I had been sitting and grated it upon the
boards but the noise arose over all and continually increased it
grew louder louder louder and still the men chatted pleasantly and
smiled was it possible they heard not almighty god no no they
heard they suspected they knew they were making a mockery of my
horror-this I thought and this I think but anything was better than
this agony anything was more tolerable than this derision I could bear
those hypocritical smiles no longer I felt that I must scream or die
and now again hark louder louder louder louder

villains I shrieked dissemble no more I admit the deed tear up
the planks here here it is the beating of his hideous heart

misery is manifold the wretchedness of earth is multiform overreaching
the wide horizon as the rainbow its hues are as various as the hues of
that arch as distinct too yet as intimately blended overreaching the
wide horizon as the rainbow how is it that from beauty I have derived
a type of unloveliness from the covenant of peace a simile of sorrow
but as in ethics evil is a consequence of good so in fact out of
joy is sorrow born either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of
to-day or the agonies which are have their origin in the ecstasies
which might have been

my baptismal name is egaeus that of my family I will not mention yet
there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy gray
hereditary halls our line has been called a race of visionaries and
in many striking particulars in the character of the family
mansion in the frescos of the chief saloon in the tapestries of the
dormitories in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory but
more especially in the gallery of antique paintings in the fashion of
the library chamber and lastly in the very peculiar nature of the
librarys contents there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant
the belief

the recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber
and with its volumes of which latter I will say no more here died my
mother herein was I born but it is mere idleness to say that I had not
lived before that the soul has no previous existence you deny it let
us not argue the matter convinced myself I seek not to convince there
is however a remembrance of aerial forms of spiritual and meaning
eyes of sounds musical yet sad a remembrance which will not be
excluded a memory like a shadow vague variable indefinite unsteady
and like a shadow too in the impossibility of my getting rid of it
while the sunlight of my reason shall exist

in that chamber was I born thus awaking from the long night of what
seemed but was not nonentity at once into the very regions of fairy
land into a palace of imagination into the wild dominions of monastic
thought and erudition it is not singular that I gazed around me with a
startled and ardent eye that I loitered away my boyhood in books
and dissipated my youth in reverie but it is singular that as years
rolled away and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my
fathers it is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs
of my life wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character
of my commonest thought the realities of the world affected me as
visions and as visions only while the wild ideas of the land of dreams
became in turn not the material of my every-day existence but in very
deed that existence utterly and solely in itself

    

berenice and I were cousins and we grew up together in my paternal
halls yet differently we grew I ill of health and buried in
gloom she agile graceful and overflowing with energy hers the
ramble on the hill-side mine the studies of the cloister I living
within my own heart and addicted body and soul to the most intense
and painful meditation she roaming carelessly through life with
no thought of the shadows in her path or the silent flight of the
raven-winged hours berenice I call upon her name berenice and
from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are
startled at the sound ah vividly is her image before me now as in the
early days of her light-heartedness and joy oh gorgeous yet fantastic
beauty oh sylph amid the shrubberies of arnheim oh naiad among its
fountains and then then all is mystery and terror and a tale which
should not be told disease a fatal disease fell like the simoon upon
her frame and even while I gazed upon her the spirit of change swept
over her pervading her mind her habits and her character and in a
manner the most subtle and terrible disturbing even the identity of
her person alas the destroyer came and went and the victim where is
she I knew her not or knew her no longer as berenice

among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and
primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the
moral and physical being of my cousin may be mentioned as the most
distressing and obstinate in its nature a species of epilepsy not
unfrequently terminating in trance itself trance very nearly
resembling positive dissolution and from which her manner of recovery
was in most instances startlingly abrupt in the mean time my own
disease for I have been told that I should call it by no other
appellation my own disease then grew rapidly upon me and assumed
finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form hourly
and momently gaining vigor and at length obtaining over me the most
incomprehensible ascendancy this monomania if I must so term it
consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in
metaphysical science termed the attentive it is more than probable
that I am not understood but I fear indeed that it is in no manner
possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader an adequate
idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which in my case
the powers of meditation not to speak technically busied and buried
themselves in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of
the universe

to muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to some
frivolous device on the margin or in the typography of a book to
become absorbed for the better part of a summers day in a quaint
shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor to lose
myself for an entire night in watching the steady flame of a lamp
or the embers of a fire to dream away whole days over the perfume of a
flower to repeat monotonously some common word until the sound by
dint of frequent repetition ceased to convey any idea whatever to the
mind to lose all sense of motion or physical existence by means of
absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in such
were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a
condition of the mental faculties not indeed altogether unparalleled
but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation

yet let me not be misapprehended the undue earnest and morbid
attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous must
not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common
to all mankind and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent
imagination it was not even as might be at first supposed an extreme
condition or exaggeration of such propensity but primarily and
essentially distinct and different in the one instance the dreamer
or enthusiast being interested by an object usually not frivolous
imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions
and suggestions issuing therefrom until at the conclusion of a day
dream often replete with luxury he finds the incitamentum or first
cause of his musings entirely vanished and forgotten in my case the
primary object was invariably frivolous although assuming through
the medium of my distempered vision a refracted and unreal importance
few deductions if any were made and those few pertinaciously
returning in upon the original object as a centre the meditations were
never pleasurable and at the termination of the reverie the first
cause so far from being out of sight had attained that supernaturally
exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease in
a word the powers of mind more particularly exercised were with me as
I have said before the attentive and are with the day-dreamer the
speculative

my books at this epoch if they did not actually serve to irritate the
disorder partook it will be perceived largely in their imaginative
and inconsequential nature of the characteristic qualities of the
disorder itself I well remember among others the treatise of the
noble italian coelius secundus curio de amplitudine beatI regni
deI st austins great work the city of god and tertullians de
carne christI in which the paradoxical sentence mortuus est dei
filius credible est quia ineptum est et sepultus resurrexit certum
est quia impossibile est occupied my undivided time for many weeks
of laborious and fruitless investigation

thus it will appear that shaken from its balance only by trivial
things my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by
ptolemy hephestion which steadily resisting the attacks of human
violence and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds trembled
only to the touch of the flower called asphodel and although to
a careless thinker it might appear a matter beyond doubt that the
alteration produced by her unhappy malady in the moral condition of
berenice would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense
and abnormal meditation whose nature I have been at some trouble in
explaining yet such was not in any degree the case in the lucid
intervals of my infirmity her calamity indeed gave me pain and
taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life i
did not fail to ponder frequently and bitterly upon the wonder-working
means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought
to pass but these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of
my disease and were such as would have occurred under similar
circumstances to the ordinary mass of mankind true to its own
character my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling
changes wrought in the physical frame of berenice in the singular and
most appalling distortion of her personal identity

during the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty most surely I had
never loved her in the strange anomaly of my existence feelings with
me had never been of the heart and my passions always were of the
mind through the gray of the early morning among the trellised shadows
of the forest at noonday and in the silence of my library at night she
had flitted by my eyes and I had seen her not as the living and
breathing berenice but as the berenice of a dream not as a being of
the earth earthy but as the abstraction of such a being not as a
thing to admire but to analyze not as an object of love but as
the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation and
now now I shuddered in her presence and grew pale at her approach
yet bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition I called to
mind that she had loved me long and in an evil moment I spoke to her
of marriage

and at length the period of our nuptials was approaching when upon
an afternoon in the winter of the year one of those unseasonably
warm calm and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful halcyon
 I sat and sat as I thought alone in the inner apartment of
the library but uplifting my eyes I saw that berenice stood before
me

was it my own excited imagination or the misty influence of the
atmosphere or the uncertain twilight of the chamber or the gray
draperies which fell around her figure that caused in it so vacillating
and indistinct an outline I could not tell she spoke no word and
I not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable an icy chill ran
through my frame a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me a
consuming curiosity pervaded my soul and sinking back upon the chair
I remained for some time breathless and motionless with my eyes riveted
upon her person alas its emaciation was excessive and not one vestige
of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour my burning
glances at length fell upon the face

the forehead was high and very pale and singularly placid and the
once jetty hair fell partially over it and overshadowed the hollow
temples with innumerable ringlets now of a vivid yellow and jarring
discordantly in their fantastic character with the reigning melancholy
of the countenance the eyes were lifeless and lustreless and
seemingly pupilless and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare
to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips they parted and in a
smile of peculiar meaning the teeth of the changed berenice disclosed
themselves slowly to my view would to god that I had never beheld them
or that having done so I had died

    

the shutting of a door disturbed me and looking up I found that my
cousin had departed from the chamber but from the disordered chamber
of my brain had not alas departed and would not be driven away
the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth not a speck on their
surface not a shade on their enamel not an indenture in their
edges but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon
my memory I saw them now even more unequivocally than I beheld
them then the teeth the teeth they were here and there and
everywhere and visibly and palpably before me long narrow and
excessively white with the pale lips writhing about them as in the
very moment of their first terrible development then came the full
fury of my monomania and I struggled in vain against its strange and
irresistible influence in the multiplied objects of the external world
I had no thoughts but for the teeth for these I longed with a phrenzied
desire all other matters and all different interests became absorbed in
their single contemplation they they alone were present to the mental
eye and they in their sole individuality became the essence of
my mental life I held them in every light I turned them in every
attitude I surveyed their characteristics I dwelt upon their
peculiarities I pondered upon their conformation I mused upon the
alteration in their nature I shuddered as I assigned to them in
imagination a sensitive and sentient power and even when unassisted by
the lips a capability of moral expression of mademoiselle salle it
has been well said que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments and
of berenice I more seriously believed que toutes ses dents etaient des
idees des idees ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me
des idees ah therefore it was that I coveted them so madly I felt
that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace in giving me
back to reason

and the evening closed in upon me thus and then the darkness came and
tarried and went and the day again dawned and the mists of a second
night were now gathering around and still I sat motionless in that
solitary room and still I sat buried in meditation and still the
phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy as with
the most vivid hideous distinctness it floated about amid the changing
lights and shadows of the chamber at length there broke in upon my
dreams a cry as of horror and dismay and thereunto after a pause
succeeded the sound of troubled voices intermingled with many low
moanings of sorrow or of pain I arose from my seat and throwing open
one of the doors of the library saw standing out in the ante-chamber
a servant maiden all in tears who told me that berenice was no more
she had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning and now at the
closing in of the night the grave was ready for its tenant and all the
preparations for the burial were completed

    

I found myself sitting in the library and again sitting there alone it
seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream
I knew that it was now midnight and I was well aware that since the
setting of the sun berenice had been interred but of that dreary
period which intervened I had no positive at least no definite
comprehension yet its memory was replete with horror horror more
horrible from being vague and terror more terrible from ambiguity it
was a fearful page in the record my existence written all over with
dim and hideous and unintelligible recollections I strived to
decypher them but in vain while ever and anon like the spirit of a
departed sound the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed
to be ringing in my ears I had done a deed what was it I asked myself
the question aloud and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered
me what was it

on the table beside me burned a lamp and near it lay a little box it
was of no remarkable character and I had seen it frequently before for
it was the property of the family physician but how came it there
upon my table and why did I shudder in regarding it these things were
in no manner to be accounted for and my eyes at length dropped to the
open pages of a book and to a sentence underscored therein the words
were the singular but simple ones of the poet ebn zaiat dicebant
mihI sodales sI sepulchrum amicae visitarem curas meas aliquantulum
fore levatas why then as I perused them did the hairs of my head
erect themselves on end and the blood of my body become congealed
within my veins

there came a light tap at the library door and pale as the tenant of a
tomb a menial entered upon tiptoe his looks were wild with terror
and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous husky and very low what said
he some broken sentences I heard he told of a wild cry disturbing the
silence of the night of the gathering together of the household of
a search in the direction of the sound and then his tones grew
thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave of
a disfigured body enshrouded yet still breathing still
palpitating still alive

he pointed to garments they were muddy and clotted with gore I spoke
not and he took me gently by the hand it was indented with the impress
of human nails he directed my attention to some object against the
wall I looked at it for some minutes it was a spade with a shriek i
bounded to the table and grasped the box that lay upon it but I could
not force it open and in my tremor it slipped from my hands and fell
heavily and burst into pieces and from it with a rattling sound
there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery intermingled with
thirty-two small white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered
to and fro about the floor

I am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion men
have called me mad but the question is not yet settled whether
madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence whether much that is
glorious whether all that is profound does not spring from disease
of thought from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general
intellect they who dream by day are cognizant of many things which
escape those who dream only by night in their gray visions they obtain
glimpses of eternity and thrill in awakening to find that they
have been upon the verge of the great secret in snatches they learn
something of the wisdom which is of good and more of the mere knowledge
which is of evil they penetrate however rudderless or compassless
into the vast ocean of the light ineffable and again like the
adventures of the nubian geographer agressI sunt mare tenebrarum quid
in eo esset exploraturi

we will say then that I am mad I grant at least that there are two
distinct conditions of my mental existence the condition of a lucid
reason not to be disputed and belonging to the memory of events
forming the first epoch of my life and a condition of shadow and doubt
appertaining to the present and to the recollection of what constitutes
the second great era of my being therefore what I shall tell of the
earlier period believe and to what I may relate of the later time
give only such credit as may seem due or doubt it altogether or if
doubt it ye cannot then play unto its riddle the oedipus

she whom I loved in youth and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly
these remembrances was the sole daughter of the only sister of my
mother long departed eleonora was the name of my cousin we had
always dwelled together beneath a tropical sun in the valley of the
many-colored grass no unguided footstep ever came upon that vale for
it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around
about it shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses no path
was trodden in its vicinity and to reach our happy home there was
need of putting back with force the foliage of many thousands of
forest trees and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of
fragrant flowers thus it was that we lived all alone knowing nothing
of the world without the valley I and my cousin and her mother

from the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our
encircled domain there crept out a narrow and deep river brighter than
all save the eyes of eleonora and winding stealthily about in mazy
courses it passed away at length through a shadowy gorge among hills
still dimmer than those whence it had issued we called it the river
of silence for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow
no murmur arose from its bed and so gently it wandered along that the
pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze far down within its bosom
stirred not at all but lay in a motionless content each in its own old
station shining on gloriously forever

the margin of the river and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided
through devious ways into its channel as well as the spaces that
extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until
they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom these spots not less
than the whole surface of the valley from the river to the mountains
that girdled it in were carpeted all by a soft green grass thick
short perfectly even and vanilla-perfumed but so besprinkled
throughout with the yellow buttercup the white daisy the purple
violet and the ruby-red asphodel that its exceeding beauty spoke to
our hearts in loud tones of the love and of the glory of god

and here and there in groves about this grass like wildernesses of
dreams sprang up fantastic trees whose tall slender stems stood not
upright but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day
into the centre of the valley their mark was speckled with the vivid
alternate splendor of ebony and silver and was smoother than all save
the cheeks of eleonora so that but for the brilliant green of the huge
leaves that spread from their summits in long tremulous lines dallying
with the zephyrs one might have fancied them giant serpents of syria
doing homage to their sovereign the sun

hand in hand about this valley for fifteen years roamed I with
eleonora before love entered within our hearts it was one evening at
the close of the third lustrum of her life and of the fourth of my own
that we sat locked in each others embrace beneath the serpent-like
trees and looked down within the water of the river of silence at our
images therein we spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day and
our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few we had drawn the
god eros from that wave and now we felt that he had enkindled within us
the fiery souls of our forefathers the passions which had for centuries
distinguished our race came thronging with the fancies for which they
had been equally noted and together breathed a delirious bliss over
the valley of the many-colored grass a change fell upon all things
strange brilliant flowers star-shaped burn out upon the trees
where no flowers had been known before the tints of the green carpet
deepened and when one by one the white daisies shrank away there
sprang up in place of them ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel and
life arose in our paths for the tall flamingo hitherto unseen with
all gay glowing birds flaunted his scarlet plumage before us the
golden and silver fish haunted the river out of the bosom of which
issued little by little a murmur that swelled at length into a
lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of aeolus-sweeter than
all save the voice of eleonora and now too a voluminous cloud which
we had long watched in the regions of hesper floated out thence all
gorgeous in crimson and gold and settling in peace above us sank day
by day lower and lower until its edges rested upon the tops of the
mountains turning all their dimness into magnificence and shutting us
up as if forever within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory

the loveliness of eleonora was that of the seraphim but she was a
maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the
flowers no guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart
and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together
in the valley of the many-colored grass and discoursed of the mighty
changes which had lately taken place therein

at length having spoken one day in tears of the last sad change
which must befall humanity she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one
sorrowful theme interweaving it into all our converse as in the songs
of the bard of schiraz the same images are found occurring again and
again in every impressive variation of phrase

she had seen that the finger of death was upon her bosom that like the
ephemeron she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die but
the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she
revealed to me one evening at twilight by the banks of the river of
silence she grieved to think that having entombed her in the valley
of the many-colored grass I would quit forever its happy recesses
transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some
maiden of the outer and everyday world and then and there I threw
myself hurriedly at the feet of eleonora and offered up a vow to
herself and to heaven that I would never bind myself in marriage to any
daughter of earth that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear
memory or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had
blessed me and I called the mighty ruler of the universe to witness the
pious solemnity of my vow and the curse which I invoked of him and
of her a saint in helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise
involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit
me to make record of it here and the bright eyes of eleonora grew
brighter at my words and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been
taken from her breast and she trembled and very bitterly wept but she
made acceptance of the vow for what was she but a child and it made
easy to her the bed of her death and she said to me not many days
afterward tranquilly dying that because of what I had done for
the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when
departed and if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the
watches of the night but if this thing were indeed beyond the power
of the souls in paradise that she would at least give me frequent
indications of her presence sighing upon me in the evening winds or
filling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the
angels and with these words upon her lips she yielded up her innocent
life putting an end to the first epoch of my own

thus far I have faithfully said but as I pass the barrier in times
path formed by the death of my beloved and proceed with the second
era of my existence I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain and i
mistrust the perfect sanity of the record but let me on years dragged
themselves along heavily and still I dwelled within the valley of the
many-colored grass but a second change had come upon all things the
star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees and appeared no
more the tints of the green carpet faded and one by one the ruby-red
asphodels withered away and there sprang up in place of them ten
by ten dark eye-like violets that writhed uneasily and were ever
encumbered with dew and life departed from our paths for the tall
flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us but flew
sadly from the vale into the hills with all the gay glowing birds that
had arrived in his company and the golden and silver fish swam down
through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet
river never again and the lulling melody that had been softer than
the wind-harp of aeolus and more divine than all save the voice of
eleonora it died little by little away in murmurs growing lower and
lower until the stream returned at length utterly into the solemnity
of its original silence and then lastly the voluminous cloud uprose
and abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old fell
back into the regions of hesper and took away all its manifold golden
and gorgeous glories from the valley of the many-colored grass

yet the promises of eleonora were not forgotten for I heard the sounds
of the swinging of the censers of the angels and streams of a holy
perfume floated ever and ever about the valley and at lone hours when
my heart beat heavily the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden
with soft sighs and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air and
once oh but once only I was awakened from a slumber like the slumber
of death by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own

but the void within my heart refused even thus to be filled I longed
for the love which had before filled it to overflowing at length the
valley pained me through its memories of eleonora and I left it for
ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world

I found myself within a strange city where all things might have served
to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the
valley of the many-colored grass the pomps and pageantries of a stately
court and the mad clangor of arms and the radiant loveliness of women
bewildered and intoxicated my brain but as yet my soul had proved true
to its vows and the indications of the presence of eleonora were still
given me in the silent hours of the night suddenly these manifestations
they ceased and the world grew dark before mine eyes and I stood
aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed at the terrible
temptations which beset me for there came from some far far distant
and unknown land into the gay court of the king I served a maiden to
whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once at whose footstool
I bowed down without a struggle in the most ardent in the most abject
worship of love what indeed was my passion for the young girl of
the valley in comparison with the fervor and the delirium and the
spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole
soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal ermengarde oh bright
was the seraph ermengarde and in that knowledge I had room for none
other oh divine was the angel ermengarde and as I looked down into
the depths of her memorial eyes I thought only of them and of her

I wedded nor dreaded the curse I had invoked and its bitterness was
not visited upon me and once but once again in the silence of the
night there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken
me and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice saying

sleep in peace for the spirit of love reigneth and ruleth and in
taking to thy passionate heart her who is ermengarde thou art absolved
for reasons which shall be made known to thee in heaven of thy vows
unto eleonora



at one time or another the largest question before every young man is
what shall I do with my life among the possible openings which best
suits his ambition his tastes and his capacities along what line
shall the undertake to make a successful career the search for a life
work and the choice of one is surely as important business as can occupy
a boy verging into manhood it is to help in the decision of those who
are considering  as a profession that this little book has been
written

to the young man who is attracted to  and begins to consider it
as a possible profession certain questions present themselves what is
 if the takes it up what will his work be and where does it
in fact offer the satisfying type of outdoor life which it appears to
offer what chance does it present for a successful career for a career
of genuine usefulness and what is the chance to make a living is he
fitted for it in character mind and body if so what training does he
need these questions deserve an answer

to the men whom it really suits  offers a career more
attractive it may be said in all fairness than any other career
whatsoever I doubt if any other profession can show a membership so
uniformly and enthusiastically in love with the work the men who have
taken it up practised it and left it for other work are few but to
the man not fully adapted for it  must be punishment pure and
simple those who have begun the study of  and then have
learned that it was not for them have doubtless been more in number
than those who have followed it through

I urge no man to make  his profession but rather to keep away
from it if the can in  a man is either altogether at home or
very much out of place unless the has a compelling love for the
foresters life and the foresters work let him keep out of it


what is a forest


first what is   is the knowledge of the forest in
particular it is the art of handling the forest so that it will render
whatever service is required of it without being impoverished or
destroyed for example a forest may be handled so as to produce saw
logs telegraph poles barrel hoops firewood tan bark or turpentine
the main purpose of its treatment may be to prevent the washing of soil
to regulate the flow of streams to support cattle or sheep or it may
be handled so as to supply a wide range and combination of uses
 is the art of producing from the forest whatever it can yield
for the service of man

before we can understand  certain facts about the forest itself
must be kept in mind a forest is not a mere collection of individual
trees just as a city is not a mere collection of unrelated men and
women or a nation like ours merely a certain number of independent
racial groups a forest like a city is a complex community with a life
of its own it has a soil and an atmosphere of its own chemically and
physically different from any other with plants and shrubs as well as
trees which are peculiar to it it has a resident population of insects
and higher animals entirely distinct from that outside most important
of all from the foresters point of view the members of the forest
live in an exact and intricate system of competition and mutual
assistance of help or harm which extends to all the inhabitants of
this complicated city of trees

the trees in a forest are all helped by mutually protecting each other
against high winds and by producing a richer and moister soil than
would be possible if the trees stood singly and apart they compete
among themselves by their roots for moisture in the soil and for light
and space by the growth of their crowns in height and breadth perhaps
the strongest weapon which trees have against each other is growth in
height in certain species intolerant of shade the tree which is
overtopped has lost the race for good the number of young trees which
destroy each other in this fierce struggle for existence is prodigious
so that often a few score per acre are all that survive to middle or old
age out of many tens of thousands of seedlings which entered the race of
life on approximately even terms

not only has a forest a character of its own which arises from the fact
that it is a community of trees but each species of tree has peculiar
characteristics and habits also just as in new york city for example
the french the germans the italians the hungarians and the chinese
each have quarters of their own and in those quarters live in
accordance with habits which distinguish each race from all the others
so the different species of pines and hemlocks oaks and maples prefer
and are found in certain definite types of locality and live in
accordance with definite racial habits which are as general and
unfailing as the racial characteristics which distinguish for example
the italians from the germans or the swedes from the chinese

the most important of these characteristics of race or species are those
which are concerned with the relation of each to light heat and
moisture thus a river birch will die if it has only as much water as
will suffice to keep a post oak in the best condition and the warm
climate in which the balsam fir would perish is just suited to the
requirements of a long leaf pine or a magnolia

the tolerance of a tree for shade may vary greatly at different times of
its life but a white pine always requires more light than a hemlock
and a beech throughout its life will flourish with less sunshine or
reflected light than for example an oak or a tulip tree

trees are limited in their distribution also by their adaptability in
which they vary greatly thus a bald cypress will grow both in wetter
and in dryer land than an oak a red cedar will flourish from florida to
the canadian line while other species like the eastern larch the
western mountain hemlock or the big trees of california are confined
in their native localities within extremely narrow limits




the foresters knowledge


the trained forester must know the forest as a doctor knows the human
machine first of all the must be able to distinguish the different
trees of which the forest is composed for that is like learning to
read the must know the way they are made and the way they grow but far
more important than all else the must base his knowledge upon that part
of  which is called silvics the knowledge of the relation of
trees to light heat and moisture to the soil and to each other

the well-trained forester must also know the forest shrubs and at least
the more important smaller forest plants something of the insect and
animal life of his domain and the birds and fish the must have a good
working knowledge of rocks soils and streams and of the methods of
making roads trails and bridges the should be an expert in woodcraft
able to travel the forest safely and surely by day or by night it is
essential that the should have a knowledge of the theory and the practice
of lumbering and the should know something about lumber markets and the
value of lumber about surveying and map making and many other matters
which are considered more at length in the chapter on training there
are as yet in america comparatively few men who have acquired even
fairly well the more important knowledge which should be included in the
training of a forester




the forest and the nation


the position of the forest in the housekeeping of any nation is unlike
that of any other great natural resource for the forest not only
furnishes wood without which civilization as we know it would be
impossible but serves also to protect or make valuable many of the
other things without which we could not get on thus the forest cover
protects the soil from the effects of wind and holds it in place for
lack of it hundreds of thousands of square miles have been converted by
the winds from moderately fertile productive land to arid drifting
sands narrow strips of forest planted as windbreaks make agriculture
possible in certain regions by preventing destruction of crops by
moisture-stealing dry winds which so afflict the central portions of our
country

without the forests the great bulk of our mining for coal metals and
the precious minerals would be either impossible or vastly more
expensive than it is at present because the galleries of mines are
propped with wood and so protected against caving in so far no
satisfactory substitute for the wooden railroad tie has been devised
and our whole system of land transportation is directly dependent for
its existence upon the forest which supplies more than one hundred and
twenty million new railroad ties every year in the united states alone

the forest regulates and protects the flow of streams its effect is to
reduce the height of floods and to moderate extremes of low water the
official measurements of the united states geological survey have
finally settled this long-disputed question by protecting mountain
slopes against excessive soil wash it protects also the lowlands upon
which this wash would otherwise be deposited and the rivers whose
channels it would clog it is well within the truth to say that the
utility of any system of rivers for transportation for irrigation for
waterpower and for domestic supply depends in great part upon the
protection which forests offer to the headwaters of the streams and
that without such protection none of these uses can be expected long to
endure

of the two basic materials of our civilization iron and wood the
forest supplies one the dominant place of the forest in our national
economy is well illustrated by the fact that no article whatsoever
whether of use or ornament whether it be for food shelter clothing
convenience protection or decoration can be produced and delivered to
the user as industry is now organized without the help of the forest
in supplying wood an examination of the history of any article
including the production of the raw material and its manufacture
transportation and distribution will at once make this point clear

the forest is a national necessity without the material the
protection and the assistance it supplies no nation can long succeed
many regions of the old world such as palestine greece northern
africa and central india offer in themselves the most impressive
object lessons of the effect upon national prosperity and national
character of the neglect of the forest and its consequent destruction




the foresters point of view


the central idea of the forester in handling the forest is to promote
and perpetuate its greatest use to men his purpose is to make it serve
the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time before
the members of any other profession dealing with natural resources the
foresters acquired the long look ahead this was only natural because
in  it is seldom that a man lives to harvest the crop which he
helped to sow the forester must look forward because the natural
resource with which the deals matures so slowly and because if steps
are to be taken to insure for succeeding generations a supply of the
things the forest yields they must be taken long in advance the idea
of using the forest first for the greatest good of the present
generation and then for the greatest good of succeeding generations
through the long future of the nation and the racethat is the
foresters point of view

the use of foresight to insure the existence of the forest in the
future and so far as practicable the continued or increasing
abundance of its service to men naturally suggested the use of
foresight in the same way as to other natural resources as well thus it
was the foresters point of view applied not only to the forest but to
the lands the minerals and the streams which produced the
conservation policy the idea of applying foresight and common-sense to
the other natural resources as well as to the forest was natural and
inevitable it works out equally as a matter of course into the
conception of a planned and orderly development of all that the earth
contains for the uses of men this leads in turn to the application of
the same principle to other questions and resources it was foreseen
from the beginning by those who were responsible for inaugurating the
conservation movement that its natural development would in time work
out into a planned and orderly scheme for national efficiency based on
the elimination of waste and directed toward the best use of all we
have for the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time
it is easy to see that this principle the foresters principle first
brought to public attention by foresters is the key to national
success

 then is seen to be peculiarly essential to the national
prosperity both now and hereafter national degradation and decay have
uniformly followed the excessive destruction of forests by other
nations and will inevitably become our portion if we continue to
destroy our forests three times faster than they are produced as we are
doing now the principles of  therefore must occupy a
commanding place in determining the future prosperity or failure of our
nation and this commanding position in the field of ideas is naturally
and properly reflected in the dignity and high standing which the
profession of  young as it is has already acquired in the
united states this position it must be the first care of every member
of the profession to maintain and increase

in the long run no profession rises higher than the degree of public
consideration which marks its members the profession of  is in
many ways a peculiarly responsible profession but in nothing more so
than in its vital connection with the whole future welfare of our
country and in the obligation which lies upon its members to see that
its reputation and standing which are the measures of its capacity for
usefulness are kept strong and clear




the establishment of 


in the united states  is passing out of the pioneer phase of
agitation and the education of public opinion and into the permanent
phase of the practice of the profession the first steps in  in
this country as in any other where the development and destruction of
natural resources has been rapid were necessarily directed mainly to
informing the public mind upon the importance of  and to
building up national and state laws and organizations for the protection
of timberlands set aside for the public benefit the right to be heard
with respect by the men who were already in control of the larger part
of our total forest wealth had to be won and has been won what is
more in the teeth of the bitterest opposition of private special
interests the right of the public to first consideration in the
protection and development of the forest and of all the resources it
contains had to be asserted and established that has now been done

in the united states these steps in the movement for the wise use of the
forest have been taken mainly in the last dozen or fifteen years during
which the federal forest organization has grown from an insignificant
division of less than a dozen men to the present united states forest
service of more than three thousand members during this period also
 both as a profession and as a public necessity has won
enduring public recognition and at the same time more public timberland
has been set aside for the public use and to remain in the public hands
than during all the rest of our history put together to-day the
national forests are reasonably safe in the protection of public
opinion not against all attack it is true but against any successful
attempt to dismember and turn them over to the special interests who
already control the bulk and the best of our forests the public has
accepted  as necessary to the public welfare both in the
present and in the future state forest organizations are springing up
 has won the right to be heard in the business offices as well
as in the conventions of the private owners of forest land and the
time for the practice of the profession has fully come




the work of a forester


what does a forester do I will try to answer this question first with
reference to the united states forest service and later as to the
numerous other fields of activity which are opening or have already
opened to the trained forester in the united states




the forest service


the united states forest service is responsible both for the general
progress of  so far as the united states government is
concerned and for the protection and use of the national forests these
national forests now cover an area of one hundred and eighty-seven
million acres or as much land as is included in all the new england
states with new york pennsylvania new jersey delaware maryland
virginia and west virginia the head of the service whose official
title is forester is charged with the great task of protecting this
vast area against fire theft and other depredations and of making all
its resources the wood water and grass the minerals and the soil
available and useful to the people of the united states under
regulations which will secure development and prevent destruction or
waste

the united states forest service consists first of a protective force
of forest guards and forest rangers who spend practically the whole of
their time in the forest second of an executive staff of forest
supervisors and their assistants who have immediate charge of the
handling of the national forests and third of an administrative staff
divided between headquarters in washington and the six local
administrative offices in the west where the national forests mainly
lie

the work of a forest ranger is first of all to protect the district
committed to his charge against fire that comes before all else for
that purpose the ranger patrols his district during the seasons when
fires are dangerous or watches for signs of fire from certain high
points called fire-lookouts or both the keeps the trails and fire
lines clear and the telephone in working order and sees to it that the
fire fighting tools such as spades axes and rakes are in good
condition and ready for service if the is wise the establishes such
relations with the people who live in his neighborhood that they become
his volunteer assistants in watching for forest fires in taking
precautions against them and in notifying him of them when they do take
place illustration stringing a forest telephone line

fighting a forest fire in some respects is like fighting a fire in a
city in both the first and most necessary thing is to get men and
apparatus to the site of the fire at the first practicable moment for
this purpose fire-engines and men are always ready in the city while
in the forest the telephones trails and bridges must be kept in
condition and the forest officers must be ready to move instantly day
or night

it is far better to prevent a forest fire from starting than to have to
put it out after it has started but in spite of all the care that can
be exercised with the means at hand many fires start each year the
forest service men extinguish not less than three thousand fires nearly
all of them while they are still small at times however when the
woods are very dry and the wind blows hard in spite of all that can be
done a fire will grow large enough to be dangerous not only to the
forest but to human life thus in the summer of  the driest ever
known in certain parts of the west high winds drove the forest fires
clear beyond the control of the fire fighters many of whom were
compelled to fight for their own lives

the worst of these fires were in montana and idaho where the whole
power of the forest service was used against them the forest rangers
under the orders of their supervisors immediately organized or took
charge of small companies of fire fighters and began the work of
getting them under control but so fierce was the wind and so terrible
the heat of the fires and the speed with which they moved that in many
places it became a question of saving the lives of the fire fighters
rather than of putting out the fires as a matter of fact nearly a
hundred of the men temporarily employed to help the government fire
fighters lost their lives and many more would have died but for the
courage resource and knowledge of the woods of the forest rangers

take for example the case of ranger edward c pulaskI of the coeur
dalene national forest stationed at wallace idaho pulaskI had charge
of forty italians and poles the had been at work with them for many
hours when the flames grew to be so threatening that it became a
question of whether the could save his men the fire was travelling
faster than the men could make their way through the dense forest and
the only hope was to find some place into which the fire could not come
accordingly pulaskI guided his party at a run through the blinding smoke
to an abandoned mine the knew of in the neighborhood when they reached
it the sent the men into the workings ahead of him hung a wet blanket
across the mouth of the tunnel and himself stood there on guard the
fierce heat the stifling air and their deadly fear drove some of the
foreigners temporarily insane and a number of them tried to break out
with drawn revolver pulaskI held them back one man did get by him and
was burned to death many fainted in the tunnel the ranger himself
more exposed than any of his men was terribly burned the stood at his
post however for five hours until the fire had passed and brought
his party through without losing a single man except that one who got
out of the tunnel although his own injuries were so severe that the was
in the hospital for two months as a result of them the record of the
forest service in these terrible fires is one of which every forester
may well be proud

the ranger must protect his district not only against fire but against
the theft of timber and the incessant efforts of land grabbers to steal
government lands to prevent the theft of timber is usually not
difficult but it is far harder to prevent fake homesteaders fraudulent
mining men and other dishonest claimants from seizing upon land to
which they have no right and so preventing honest men from using these
claims to make a living

in the past this problem has presented the most serious difficulties
and still occasionally does so there is no louder shouter for justice
than a balked habitual land thief with political influence behind him
to illustrate the kind of attack upon the forest service to which
fraudulent land claims have constantly given rise I may cite the
statements made during one of the annual attempts in the senate to break
down the service one of the senators asserted that in his state the
forest service was overbearing and tyrannical and that in a particular
case it had driven out of his home a citizen known to the senator and
had left him and his family to wander houseless upon the hillside and
that for no good reason whatsoever

this statement if it had been true would at once have destroyed the
standing of the service in the minds of many of its friends and would
have led to immediate defeat in the fight then going on fortunately
the records of the service were so complete and the knowledge of field
conditions on the part of the men in washington was so thorough that
the mere mention of the general locality of the supposed outrage by the
senator made it easy to identify the individual case the man in
question instead of being an honest settler with a wife and family was
the keeper of a disreputable saloon and dance hall a well-known
law-breaker whom the local authorities had tried time and again to
dispossess and drive away but by means of his fraudulent claim the man
had always defeated the local officers when however the officers of
the forest service took the case in hand the situation changed and
things moved quickly the disreputable saloon was promptly removed from
the fraudulent land claim by means of which the keeper of it had held
on and this thoroughly undesirable citizen either went out of business
or removed his abominable trade to some locality outside the national
forest

the actual facts were fully brought out in the debate next day remained
uncontradicted and saved the fight for the forest service the whole
incident may be found at length in the congressional record

the forest ranger is charged with overseeing and regulating the free use
of timber by settlers and others who live in or near the national
forests last year  the forest service gave away without charge
more than  worth of saw timber house logs fencing fuel and
other material to men and women who needed it for their own use usually
it is the rangers work to issue the permits for this free use and to
designate the timber that may be cut for this purpose the must be well
acquainted with the kinds and the uses of the trees in his district and
it is most important that the should know something of how their
reproduction can best be secured in order that the free use may be
permitted without injury to the future welfare of the forest

a ranger oversees the use of his district for the grazing of cattle
sheep and other domestic animals the must acquaint himself with the
brands and marks of the various owners and should be well posted in the
essentials of the business of raising cattle sheep and horses the
allotment of grazing areas is one of the most difficult problems to
adjust because the demand is almost always for much more range than is
available and the division of what range there is among the local owners
of stock often presents serious difficulties in which the rangers
local knowledge and advice is constantly sought by his superior officer

there is a wise law passed at the request of the forest service under
which land in the national forests which is shown to be agricultural may
be entered under the homestead law and used for the making of homes
this law is peculiarly hard to carry out because the ceaseless efforts
of land grabbers to misuse it demand great vigilance on the part of the
forest officers in many cases it is the ranger who makes the report
upon which the decision as to the agricultural or non-agricultural
character of the land is based although in other cases the
examinations to determine whether the land is really agricultural in
character are made by examiners especially trained for this duty
serious controversies into which politics enter are often caused by the
efforts of speculators and others under pretext of this law to get
possession of lands chiefly valuable for their timber

the building and maintenance of trails telephone lines roads bridges
and fences in his district is under the charge of the ranger and in
many cases rangers and forest guards are appointed by the state as
wardens to see to it that the game and fish laws are properly enforced

next to the protection of his district from fire the most important
duty of the ranger has to do with the sale of timber and the marking of
the individual trees which are to be cut the reproduction of the forest
depends directly on what trees are kept for seed or on how the
existing young growth is protected and preserved in felling and swamping
the trees which have been marked for cutting and in skidding the logs
the disposal of the slash must be looked after for it has much to do
with forest reproduction and with promoting safety from fire then the
scaling of the logs determines the amount of the payment the government
receives for its timber and there are often regulations governing the
transportation of the scaled logs whose enforcement is of great
consequence to the future forest

illustration forest rangers scaling timber

nearly all of these duties the ranger may perform in certain cases
without supervision if his judgment and training are sufficient but
the marking especially is often done under the eye or in accordance with
the directions of the technical forester whose duty it is to see that
the future of the forest is protected by enforcing the conditions of
sale

these are but a part of the duties of the ranger for the is concerned
with all the uses which his district may serve the streams for
example may be important for city water supply irrigation or for
waterpower and their use for these purposes must be under his eye
hotels and saw-mills on sites leased from the government may dot his
district here and there the land within national forests may be put to
a thousand other uses from a bee ranch on the cleveland forest in
southern california to a whaling station on the tongass forest in
alaska all of which means work for him

the result of all this is that the ranger comes in contact with city
dwellers irrigators cattlemen sheepmen and horsemen ranchers
storekeepers hotel men hunters miners and lumbermen and above all
with the settlers who live in or near his district with all these it is
his duty to keep on good terms for well the knows that one man at
certain times can set more fires than a regiment can extinguish and
that the best protection for his district comes from the friendly
interest of the men who live in it or near it

a forest guard is in effect an assistant to the ranger and may be
called upon to carry out most of the duties which fall upon a ranger

the foregoing short statement will make it clear that preliminary
experience as a ranger may be of the utmost value to the man who
proposes later on to perform in the government service the duties of a
trained forester it is becoming more and more common and fortunately
so for graduates of forest schools to begin their work in the united
states forest service as rangers or forest guards the man who has done
well a rangers work like the graduate of an engineering school who
after graduation has entered a machine shop as a hand has acquired a
body of practical information and experience which will be invaluable to
him in the later practice of his profession and which is far beyond the
reach of any man who has not been trained in the actual execution of
this work on the ground and in actual daily contact with the
multifarious uses and users of the forest




the forest supervisor

the supervisor is the general manager of a national forest the
responsibility for the protection care and use of it falls upon him
under the direction of the district forester the supervisor is
responsible for making the use of his forest as valuable and as
convenient as possible for the people in and around the area of which he
has charge the deals with the organizations of forest users such as
local stock associations and issues permits for grazing live stock in
the forest permits for cutting small amounts of timber are granted by
him and the advertises in the papers the sale of larger amounts and
receives bids from prospective purchasers keeps the accounts of his
forest and makes regular reports on a variety of important subjects
such as the personnel of his forest force the permanent improvements
made or to be made the permits issued for regular and special uses of
the forest and for free use of timber and forage the number and kinds
of predatory animals killed the amount of forest planting accomplished
and the expense and losses from forest fires the has general oversight
of the roads trails and other improvements on his forest and prepares
plans for the extension of them in particular the directs controls
and inspects the work of the ranger and guards and in general he
attends to the thousand and one matters which go to adjusting the use of
the forest to the needs of the men who use it and on which depends
whether the forest is well or badly thought of among the people whose
coöperation or opposition have so much to do with making its management
successful or otherwise

the supervisor spends about half his time in the office and half in the
field inspecting the work of his men and consulting with them meeting
local residents or associations of local residents who have propositions
to submit for improving the service of the forest to them or for
correcting mistakes or who wish to lay before the supervisor some one
of the numberless matters in which the forest affects their welfare the
usefulness of the supervisor depends as much upon his good judgment his
ability to meet men and do business with them and his knowledge of
local needs and local affairs as it does upon his knowledge of the
forest itself as in the case of every superior officer his attitude
toward his work his energy his good sense and his good will are or
should be reflected in the men under him so that his position is one of
the greatest importance in determining the success or failure of each
national forest and hence of the forest service as a whole more and
more of the trained foresters in the service are seeking and securing
appointments as forest supervisors because of the interest and
satisfaction they find in the work such men handle both the
professional and business sides of forest management many of their
duties therefore are described in the succeeding chapter

the position of supervisor is in many respects the most desirable a
trained forester can occupy in the forest service and the most
responsible of the field positions




the trained forester


to each forest where timber cutting has become important there are
assigned one or more forest assistants or forest examiners these are
professionally trained foresters they are subordinate upon each forest
to the supervisor as manager but it is their work which has most to do
with deciding whether the forest service in general is to be successful
or is to fail in the great task of preserving the forest by wise use

the forest assistant secures his position with the service by passing an
examination devised to test his technical knowledge and his ability
after the has served two years as forest assistant the quality and
quantity of his work will have determined his fitness to continue in
the employ of the government if the is unfit the may be dropped for
there are many young and ambitious men ready to step into his place if
he makes good the is promoted to the grade of forest examiner and is put
definitely in charge of certain lines of professional work always of
course under the direction of the supervisor of whom the becomes the
adviser on all problems involving technical 

the most important tasks of the trained forester on a national forest
are the preparation of working plans for the use of the forest by
methods which will protect and perpetuate it as well and the carrying
out of the plans when made this is  in the technical sense of
the word it involves a thorough study of the kinds of timber their
amount and location their rate of growth their value the ease or
difficulty of their reproduction and the methods by which the timber
can be cut at a profit and at the same time the reproduction of the
forest can be safely secured a working plan usually includes a
considerable number of maps which often have to be drawn in the first
place from actual surveys on the ground by the forest examiner these
maps contain the information secured by working-plan studies and are of
the first necessity for the wise and skilful handling of the forest
they often constitute also most important documents in the history of
its condition and use

on many of the national forests the need for immediate use of the timber
is so urgent and so just that there is no time to prepare elaborate
working plans timber sales must be made and made at once but they
must be made nevertheless in a way that will fully protect the future
welfare of the forest whether working plans can be prepared or not a
most important duty of the technical forester is to work out the
conditions under which a given body of timber can be cut with safety to
the forest especially with safety to its reproduction and future
growth the principal study for a timber sale will usually include an
examination of the general features and condition of the forest and the
determination of the diameter down to which it is advisable to cut the
standing trees a diameter which must be fixed at such a size as will
protect the forest and make the lumbering pay it will include also an
investigation more or less thorough and complete as the conditions
warrant of the silvical habits of one or more of the species of trees
in that forest the areas which form natural units for the logging and
transportation of the timber must be worked out and laid off and
careful estimates or measurements of the amount of standing timber and
of its value on the stump must be made as well as of the cost of
moving it to the mill or to the railroad

the forest examiner must also consider in many cases the building of
logging roads or railroads timber slides etc and must make a careful
study of the material into which the trees to be cut can best be worked
up and of the value of such material in the market most of all
however the must study think over and decide what the will recommend as
to the conditions which are to govern the logging conditions by which
the protection of the forest is to be insured these conditions fixed
by his superiors upon the report of the forest examiner determine
whether an individual timber sale is  or forest destruction
this is the central question in the administration of the national
forests from the national point of view

the principal objects of the conditions laid down for a timber sale are
always the reproduction of the forest and its safety against fire
natural reproduction from self-sown seed is almost invariably the result
desired and so the question of the seed trees to be left and how they
are to be located or spaced is fundamental unless there is ample young
growth already on the ground in the latter case this young growth must
not be smashed or bent by throwing the older trees on top of it or
against it and the young saplings bent down by the felled tops must be
promptly released

in order to avoid danger to the young growth already present or to be
secured as well as to protect the older trees from fires the slash
produced in lumbering the tops lopped from the trees up to and beyond
the highest point to which the lumbermen are required to take the logs
must be satisfactorily disposed ofeither by scattering it thinly over
the ground by piling and burning or often by piling alone

these and many other conditions of sale must be studied out in a form
adapted to each particular case and must be discussed with the men who
propose to buy who often have wise and practical suggestions to make

similar questions on a less important scale present themselves and must
be answered in the matter of small timber sales and of timber given
without charge under free-use permits to settlers and others

when the terms of a contract of sale have been worked out and accepted
and the timber has been sold then the forest assistant has charge of
the extremely interesting task of marking the trees that are to be cut
in accordance with these terms usually this is done by marking all the
trees which are to be felled but sometimes by marking only the trees
which are to remain

the marking is usually done by blazing each tree and stamping the
letters u s upon the blaze with a government marking axe or hatchet
it must be done in such a way that the loggers will have no excuse
either for cutting an unmarked tree or leaving a marked tree uncut or
vice versa as the case may be the marking may be carried out by the
rangers and forest guards under supervision of the forest assistant or
in difficult situations the may mark or direct the marking of each tree
himself marking is fascinating work

later while the logging is under way the forest examiner will often
inspect it to see that the terms of the sale are complied with that the
trees cut are thrown in places where they will not unduly damage either
young growth or the larger trees which are to remain and that the other
conditions laid down for the logging in the contract of sale are
observed the scaling of the logs to determine the amount of payment to
the government will many times be under his supervision although in the
larger sales this work as well as the routine inspection of the
logging is usually carried out by a special body of expert lumbermen
who often bring to it a much wider knowledge of the woods than the men
in actual charge of the lumbering

in nearly every national forest there are areas upon which the trees
have been destroyed by fire many of these are so large or so remote
from seed-bearing trees that natural reproduction will not suffice to
replace the forest in such localities planting is needed and for that
purpose the forest examiner must establish and conduct a forest nursery
the decision on the kind of trees to plant and on the methods of raising
and planting them the collection of the seed the care and
transplanting of the young trees until they are set out on the site of
the future forest forms a task of absorbing interest such work often
requires a high degree of technical skill it is likely to occupy a
larger and larger share of the time and attention of the trained men of
the forest service

illustration a forest examiner running a compass line

the forest assistants or examiners knowledge of surveying makes it
natural for him to take an important part in the laying out of new roads
and trails in the forest or in correcting the lines of old ones and
there is little work more immediately useful the forest can be
safeguarded effectively just in proportion to the ease with which all
parts of it can be reached forest protection may be less technically
interesting than other parts of the foresters work but nothing that he
does is more important or pays larger dividends in future results

in addition to his studies of the habits and reproduction of the
different trees for working plans or timber sales or simply to increase
his knowledge of the forest the forest examiner is often called upon to
lay out sample plots for ascertaining the exact relation of each species
to light heat and moisture or for studying its rate of growth the may
find it necessary to determine the effect of the grazing of cattle or
sheep on young growth of various species and of various ages or to
ascertain their relative resistance to fire in general what time he
can spare from more pressing duties is very fully occupied with adding
to his silvical knowledge by observation with studies of injurious
insects or fungI of the reasons for the increase or decrease of
valuable or worthless species of trees in the forest the innumerable
secondary effects of forest fires the causes of the local distribution
of trees or with some other of the thousand questions which give a
never-failing interest to work in the woods

the protection of a valuable kind of tree often depends upon the ability
to find a use for and therefore to remove a less-valuable species
which is crowding it out for as yet the american forester can do very
little cutting or thinning that does not pay just so the protection of
a given tract against fire may depend upon the ability to use and
therefore to remove a part or the whole of the dead and down timber
which now makes it a fire trap for such reasons as these the uses of
wood and the markets for its disposal form exceedingly important
branches of study for the forest examiner who will usually find that
his duties require him to be thoroughly familiar with them

it is more and more common to find each forest officerranger forest
examiner or supervisorcombining in himself the qualities and the
knowledge required to fill any or all of the other positions the
professionally trained man who develops marked executive ability is
likely to become a supervisor just as a ranger with the necessary
training and experience who may wish to devote himself to silvical
investigations may be transferred to that work the point is that each
man has individual opportunity to establish and occupy the place for
which the is best fitted

the success of the technical forester like that of the ranger and
indeed of nearly every government forest officer in whatever position
or line of work will very frequently depend on his good judgment and
practical sense the chief ingredient of which will always be his
knowledge of local needs and conditions and his sympathetic
understanding of the local point of view this does not mean that the
local point of view is always to control on the contrary the forest
officer must often decide against it in the interest of the welfare of
the larger public but the desires and demands of the users of the
forest should always be given the fullest hearing and the most careful
consideration to this rule there is no exception whatsoever




personal equipment


 differs from most professions in this that it requires as much
vigor of body as it does vigor of mind the sort of man to which it
appeals and which it seeks is the man with high powers of observation
who does not shrink from responsibility and whose mental vigor is
balanced by physical strength and hardiness the man who takes up
 should be little interested in his own personal comfort and
should have and conserve endurance enough to stand severe physical work
accompanied by mental labor equally exhausting

foresters are still few in numbers and the point of view which they
represent while it is making immense strides in public acceptance is
still far from general application therefore foresters are still
missionaries in a very real sense and since they are so few it is of
the utmost importance that they should stand closely together
differences of opinion there must always be in all professions but
there is no other profession in which it is more important to keep these
differences from working out into animosities or separations of any
kind we are fortunate above all in this that american foresters are
united as probably the members of no other profession this esprit de
corps has given them their greatest power of achievement and any man
who proposes to enter the profession should do so with this fact clearly
in mind

the high standard which the profession of  new in the united
states has already reached its great power for usefulness to the
nation now and hereafter and the large responsibilities which fall so
quickly on the men who are trained to accept itall these things give
to the profession a position and dignity which it should be the first
care of every man who enters it to maintain or increase

to stand well at graduation is or ought to be far less the object of a
foresters training than to stand well ten or twenty years after
graduation it is of the first importance that the training should be
thorough and complete

a friend of mine john muir says that the best advice the can give young
men is take time to get rich his idea of getting rich is to fill
his mind and spirit full with observations of the nature the so deeply
loves and so well understands so that in his mind it is not money which
makes riches but life in the open and the seeing eye

next to those basic traits of personal character without which no man
is worth his salt the foresters most important quality is the power of
observation the power to note and understand or seek to understand
what the sees in the forest it is just as essential a part of the
foresters equipment to be able to see what is wrong with a piece of
forest and what is required for its improvement as it is necessary for
a physician to be able to diagnose a disease and to prescribe the
remedy

silvics which may be said to be the knowledge of how trees behave in
health and disease toward each other and toward light heat moisture
and the soil is the foundation of  and the foresters first
task is to bring himself to a high point of efficiency in observing and
interpreting these facts of the forest and to keep himself there it
should be as hard work to walk through the forest and see what is there
to be seen as to wrestle with the most difficult problem of
mathematics no man can be a good forester without that quality of
observation and understanding which the french call the foresters
eye it is not the only quality required for success in  but
it is unquestionably the first

perhaps the second among the qualities necessary for the forester is
common sense which most often simply means a sympathetic understanding
of the circumstances among which a man finds himself the american
forester must know the united states and understand its people nothing
which affects the welfare of his country should be indifferent to him
 is a form of practical statesmanship which touches the national
life at so many points that no forester can safely allow himself to
remain ignorant of the needs and purposes of his fellow citizens or to
be out of touch with the current questions of the day the best citizen
makes the best forester and no man can make a good forester unless he
is a good citizen also

the forester can not succeed unless the understands the problems and
point of view of his country and that is the reason why foresters from
other lands were not brought into the united states in the early stages
of the forest movement at that time practically no american foresters
had yet been trained and the great need of the situation was for men to
do the immediately pressing work foresters from germany france
switzerland and other countries could have been obtained in abundant
numbers and at reasonable salaries they were not invited to come
because however well trained in technical  they could not have
understood the habits of thought of our people therefore in too many
cases they would have failed to establish the kind of practical
understanding which a forester must have with the men who use or work
in his forest if the is to succeed it was wiser to wait until
americans could be trained for the practising forester must handle men
as well as trees

one of the most difficult things to do in any profession which involves
drudgery and I take it that no profession which does not involve
drudgery is worth the attention of a man is to look beyond the daily
routine to the things which that routine is intended to assist in
accomplishing this is peculiarly true of  in which perhaps
more than in any other profession the long-distance far-sighted
attitude of mind is essential to success the trees a forester plants he
himself will seldom live to harvest much of his thought about his
forest must be in terms of centuries the great object for which the is
striving of necessity can not be fully accomplished during his lifetime
he must therefore accustom himself to look ahead and to reap his
personal satisfaction from the planned and orderly development of a
scheme the perfect fruit of which the can never hope to see

this is one of the strongest reasons why the forester whether in public
or private employment must always look upon himself as a public
servant it is of the first importance that the should accustom himself
to think of the results of his work as affecting not primarily himself
but others always including the general public it is essential for a
forester to form the habit of looking far ahead out of which grows a
sound perspective and persistence in body and mind

one of the greatest football players of our time makes the distinction
between a player who is quick and a player who is soon in his
description the quick player is the man who waits until the last
moment and then moves with nervous and desperate haste in the little
time the has left the man who is soon however almost invariably
arrives ahead of the man who is quick because the has thought out in
advance exactly where the is going and how to get there and when the
moment comes the does not delay his start makes no false motions and
thereby makes and keeps himself efficient  is preëminently a
profession for the soon man for it is the steady preparation long in
advance the well-thoughtout plan well stuck to which in 
brings success

in my experience men differ comparatively little in mere ability in
the quality of the mental machine through which the spirit works nine
times out of ten it is not ability which brings success but
persistence and enthusiasm which are usually but not always the same
as vision and will we all have ability enough to do the things which
lie before us but the man with the will to keep everlastingly at it
and the vision to realize the meaning and value of the results for which
he is striving is the man who wins in nearly every case this is true
in all human affairs but it is peculiarly true of the forester and his
task the end of which lies so far ahead

in a class below me at phillips-exeter academy was a boy who had just
entered the school his great ambition was to play football and he
came to the practise day after day his abilities however were
apparently not on the same plane with his ambitions and his work was so
ridiculously poor that the became the laughing stock of the whole school
that however troubled him not at all what held his mind was football
undiscouraged and undismayed the kept on playing football until in his
last year the became captain of the exeter football team

every man of experience has known many similar cases it is clear i
think that the master qualities in achievement are neither luck nor
mere ability but rather enthusiasm and persistence or vision and will

in a peculiar sense the forester depends upon public opinion and public
support for the means of carrying on his work and for its final
success but the attention which the public gives or can give to any
particular subject varies and of necessity must vary from time to
time under these circumstances it is inevitable that the forester must
meet discouragements checks and delays as well as periods of smooth
sailing the should expect them and should be prepared to discount them
when they come when they do come I know of no better way of reducing
their bad effects than for a man to make allowance for his own state of
mind the who can stand off and look at himself impartially realizing
that the will not feel to-morrow as the feels to-day has a powerful
weapon against the temporary discouragements which are necessarily met
in any work that is really worth while progress is always in spirals
and there is always a good time coming there is nothing so fatal to
good work as that flabby spirit under which some weak men try to hide
their inefficiencythe spirit of whats the use

it has been the experience of every forester as the goes about the
country to be told that a certain mountain is impassable that a
certain trail can not be travelled that a certain stream can not be
crossed and to find that mountain trail and stream can all be passed
with little serious difficulty by a man who is willing to try most
things said to be impossible are so only in the mind of the man whose
timidity or inertness keeps him from making the attempt the whole story
of the establishment and growth of the united states forest service is a
story of the doing of things which the men who did them were warned in
advance would be impossible usually the thing which cant be done is
well worth trying

perhaps I ought to add that I am not urging the young forester to
disregard local public opinion without the best of reasons or to rush
his horse blindly into the ford of a swollen stream good sense is the
first condition of success I am merely saying that in ninety-nine cases
out of a hundred when a thing ought to be done it can be done if the
effort is made with that idea in mind

all this is but one way of saying that the forester should be his own
severest taskmaster the forester must keep himself up to his own work
in no other profession to my knowledge is a man thrown so completely
on his own responsibility the forester often leads an isolated life for
weeks or months at a time seeing the men under whom the works only at
distant intervals because the is so much his own master the
responsibility which rests upon him is peculiarly his own and must be
met out of the resources within himself

the training of a forester should lead him to be practical in the right
sense of that word which emphatically is not the sense of abandoning
standards of work or conduct in order to get immediate results the
practical men with whom the forester must do his worklumbermen
cattlemen sheepmen settlers forest users of all kindsare often by
very much his superiors in usable knowledge of the details of their
work their opinions are entitled to the most complete hearing and
respect there is no other class of men from whose advice the forester
can so greatly profit if the chooses to do so the is superior to them if
at all only in his technical knowledge and in the broader point of
view the has derived from his professional training it is of the first
importance that the young forester should know these men should learn
to like and respect them and that the should get all the help the can
from their knowledge and practical experience the willingness to use
the information and assistance which such men were ready to give has
more than once meant the difference between failure and success

the young forester like other young men is likely to be impatient i
do not blame him for it rightly directed his impatience may become one
of his best assets but it will do no harm to remember also that the
human race has reached its present degree of civilization and
advancement only step by step and that it seems likely to proceed in
very much the same way hereafter as a general rule results slowly and
painfully accomplished are lasting the results to be achieved in
 must be lasting if they are to be valuable

in general the men with whom the forester deals can adopt and in many
cases ought to adopt a new point of view but slowly to fall in love
at first sight with theories or policies is as rare as the same
experience is between persons as a rule an intellectual conviction
however well founded must be followed by a period of incubation and
growth before it can blossom into a definite principle of action before
the man who holds it is ready to work or fight in order to carry it out
there is a rate in the adoption of new ideas beyond which only the most
unusual circumstances will induce mens minds to move  has gone
ahead in the united states faster than it ever did in any other land if
it proceeds a little less rapidly now that so much of the field has
been won there will be no reason for discouragement in that


as a subordinate officer

necessarily the young forester will begin as a subordinate how soon he
will come to give orders of his own will depend on how well the executes
the orders of his superior in particular it will depend on whether he
requires to be coddled in doing his work or whether the is willing and
able to stand on his own feet the man for whom every employer of men is
searching everywhere and always is the man who will accept the
responsibility for the work the has to dowho will not lean at every
point upon his superior for additional instructions advice or
encouragement

there is no more valuable subordinate than the man to whom you can give
a piece of work and then forget about it in the confident expectation
that the next time it is brought to your attention it will come in the
form of a report that the thing has been done when this master quality
is joined to executive power loyalty and common sense the result is a
man whom you can trust on the other hand there is no greater nuisance
to a man heavily burdened with the direction of affairs than the
weak-backed assistant who is continually trying to get his chief to do
his work for him on the feeble plea that the thought the chief would
like to decide this or that himself the man to whom an executive is
most grateful the man whom the will work hardest and value most is the
man who accepts responsibility willingly and is not continually under
his feet


as a superior officer

the principles of effective administrative work have never so far as i
know been adequately classified and defined when they come to be
stated one of the most important will be found to be the exact
assignment of responsibility so that whatever goes wrong the
administrative head will know clearly and at once upon whom the
responsibility falls this is one of the reasons why as a rule boards
and commissions are far less effective in getting things done than
single men with clear-cut authority and equally clear-cut
responsibility another principle so well known that it has almost
become a proverb is to delegate everything you can to do nothing that
you can get someone else to do for you but the wisdom of letting a good
man alone is less commonly understood it is sometimes as important for
the superior officer not to worry his subordinate with useless orders as
it is for the subordinate not to harass his superior with useless
questions

let a good man alone give him his head nothing will hold him so
rigidly to his work as the feeling that the is trusted lead your men in
their work and above all make of your organization not a monarchy
limited or unlimited but a democracy in which the responsibility of
each man for a particular piece of work shall not only be defined but
recognized in which the credit for each mans work so far as possible
shall be attached to his own name in which the opinions and advice of
your subordinates are often sought before decisions are made in a word
a democracy in which each man feels a personal responsibility for the
success of the whole enterprise

the young forester may be years removed from the chance to apply these
principles in practice but since no superior officer can put them into
fruitful effect without the coöperation of his subordinates it is well
that they should be known at both ends of the line


a public servant

I repeat that whether a forester is engaged in private work or in public

lumbermen a fishing and shooting club the owner of a great estate or

state forest work


the work of the states in  is still in the pioneer stage and
the work of a state forester must still bear largely on the creation of
a right public sentiment in forest matters in state  the need
for agitation has by no means passed it is often the duty of the state
forester to prepare or endeavor to secure the passage of good state
forest laws or to interpose against the enactment of bad laws in
particular much of his time is likely to be given to legislation upon
the subjects of forest fires and forest taxation upon the latter there
is as yet no sound and effective public opinion in many parts of the
united states and legislatures and people still do not understand how
powerful bad methods of forest taxation have been and still are in
forcing the destructive cutting of timber by making it impossible to
wait for the better methods of lumbering which accompany a better
market I have known the taxes on standing timber to equal six per cent
a year on the reasonable value of the stumpage

thirteen states have state forests with a total area altogether of
 acres of these new york has the largest area its state
forests cover  acres partly in the adirondacks and partly in
the catskills pennsylvania comes next with nine hundred and eighty-four
thousand acres and wisconsin third with about four hundred thousand
acres

twenty-nine states make appropriations for forest work excluding
special appropriations for courses in  at universities
colleges and schools the total amount spent for this purpose is about
 pennsylvania has the largest appropriationthree hundred
and twenty-eight thousand dollars in addition to which a special
appropriation of two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars has been
devoted to checking the chestnut blight minnesota comes second with two
hundred and thirty-three thousand dollars new york third with about
one hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars and wisconsin next with
ninety-five thousand dollars

thirty-three states have state forest officers of whom fifteen are
state foresters by title while the majority of the remainder perform
duties of a very similar nature

eleven states are receiving assistance from the federal government under
the weeks law which authorizes coöperation for fire protection
provided the state will furnish a sum equal to that allotted to it from
the national fund with a limit of ten thousand dollars to a single
state

for purposes of reforestation ten states maintain forest nurseries
during the year  they produced in round numbers twenty million young
trees of which fourteen million were distributed to the citizens of
these ten states

in some states the waterpower question falls within the sphere of the
state forester as well as other similar conservation matters while it
has usually been made his duty to assist private timberland owners in
the handling of their holdings whether these be the larger holdings of
lumber companies or the farmers woodlots in many states the state
forester is made responsible for the enforcement of the state forest
fire laws and for the control and management of a body of state fire
wardens who may or may not be permanently employed in that work the
enforcement of laws which exempt timberlands or lands planted to timber
from taxation or limit the taxation upon them are also usually under
his supervision

the work of  in the various states being on the whole much less
advanced than it is in the nation the state forester must still occupy
himself largely with those preliminary phases of the work of 
through which the national forest service has already passed much
progress however is being made and we may fairly count not only that
state forest organizations will ultimately exist in every state but
that the state foresters will exert a steadily increasing influence on
forest perpetuation in the united states




the forest service in washington


a description of what a forester has to do which did not include the
work of the government foresters at the national capital would
necessarily be incomplete the following outline may therefore help to
round out the picture

the washington headquarters of the forest service are directly in charge
of the forester and his immediate assistants the forester has general
supervision of the whole service it is the who with the approval of the
secretary of agriculture determines the general policy which is to
govern the service in the very various and numerous matters with which
it has to deal the keeps his hand upon the whole machinery of the
service holds it up to its work and in general is responsible for
supplying it with the right spirit and point of view without which any
kind of efficiency is impossible

the forester prepares the estimates or annual budget for the
expenditures of the service and appears before committees of congress
to explain the need for money and otherwise to set forth or defend the
work upon which the service is engaged his immediate subordinates spend
a large part of their time in the field inspecting the work of the
service and keeping its tone high their reports to the forester keep
him thoroughly advised as to the situation on all the national forests
so that the may wisely meet each question as it comes up and adjust the
regulations and routine business methods of the service to the
constantly changing needs of the people with whom it deals

being responsible for the personnel of the forest service the forester
recommends to the secretary of agriculture by whom the actual papers
are issued all appointments to it as well as promotions reductions
and dismissals under his immediate eye also is the very important and
necessary work of making public the information collected by the service
for the use of the people since   publications of the service
have been issued with a total circulation of  copies

the publications of the united states forest service include by far the
most and the best information upon the forests of this country which has
until now been assembled and printed hence the prospective student of
 can do nothing better than to write to the forester
washington d c which is the correct address for the annotated
catalogue of these publications which is sent free to all applicants
and then to secure and study such of the bulletins and circulars as best
meet his individual needs if the looks forward to entering the united
states forest service the should not fail to get also the use book the
volume of directions and regulations in accordance with which the
national forests are protected developed and made available and useful
to the people of the regions in which they lie

the dendrological work of the service which has to do with forest
distribution the identification of tree species and other forest
botanical work is also under the immediate supervision of the forester
and the chief lumberman reports directly to him

in addition to the work which falls immediately under the eye of the
forester and which used to but does not now include the legal work
necessary to support and promote the operations of the service there
are seven principal parts or branches in the work of the washington
headquarters the first of these is the branch of accounts whose work i
need not describe further than to say that the service has always owed a
very large part of its safety against the bitter attacks of its enemies
to the accuracy completeness and general high quality of its
accounting system

the second branch that of operation has charge of the business
administration both of the national forests and of the other work of
the forest service here the business methods which are necessary to
keep the organization at a high state of efficiency are formulated put
in practice and constantly revised for it is only by such revision
that they can be kept as they are kept at a level with the very best
practice of the best modern business there are very few government
bureaus of which this can be said the branch of operation is
responsible for the adoption and enforcement of labor-saving devices in
correspondence in handling requisitions and in the filing and care of
papers generally and for the supply of stationery tools and
instruments and the renting of quartersin a word for the whole of
the more or less routine transaction of business which is essential to
keep so large an organization at the highest point of efficiency

illustration brush piling in a national forest timber sale

the office work needed in the mapping of the national forests with
all their resources boundaries and interior holdings is in charge of
the branch of operation so is the immense amount of drafting which is
necessary in the other work of the service and the photographic
laboratory in which maps are reproduced and where permanent photographic
records of the condition of the forest are made

the third branch that of silviculture is the most important of all it
has oversight of the practice of  on all the national forests
and of all scientific forest studies in the national forests and
outside it is here that the conditions in the contracts under which the
larger timber sales are made are finally examined and approved and here
are found the inspectors whose duty it is not only to see that the work
is well done but to labor constantly for improvements in methods as
well as in results here centres the preparation of forest working
plans and the knowledge of lumber and the lumber markets

the branch of silviculture has charge also of national coöperation for
the advancement of  with the several states and in particular
for fire protection under the weeks law this form of coöperation has
made the knowledge and equipment of the forest service available for the
study of state forest resources and forest problems and much of the
progress in  made by the states is directly due to it

under the branch of silviculture the office of forest investigations
brings together all that is known of the nature and growth of trees in
this country and to some extent in other countries also conducts
independent studies of the greatest value in developing better methods
of securing the reproduction of important forest trees and computes
the enormous number of forest measurements dealing with the stand and
the rate of growth of trees and forests that are turned in by the
parties engaged in forest investigation in the field under the office
of forest investigations studies in forest distribution and in the
structure of wood are carried on and it includes the library of the
forest service by far the most complete and effective forest library in
the united states

the fourth branch that of grazing supervises the use of the national
forests for pasture over the greater part of the west this was the
first use to which the forests were put and an idea of its magnitude
may be gathered from the fact that every year the national forests
supply feed for about a million and a half cattle and horses and more
than fourteen million sheep it is no easy task to permit all this live
stock to utilize the forage which the national forests produce and yet
do little or no harm to the young growth on which the future of the
forest depends to exclude the grazing animals altogether is impossible
and undesirable for to do so would ruin the leading industry in many
portions of the west consequently many of the most difficult and
perplexing questions in the practical administration of the national
forests have occurred in the work of the branch of grazing and have
there been solved and many of the most bitter attacks upon it have
there been met

the fifth branch that of lands has to do with the questions which
arise from the use of the land in the national forests for farming or
ranching mining and a very wide variety of other purposes and with
the exceedingly numerous and intricate questions which arise because
there are about  acres of land within the boundaries of the
national forests whose title has already passed from the government the
boundaries of the national forests also are constantly being examined to
determine whether they include all the land and only the land to be
contained within them and whether they should be extended or reduced

the first permits for the use of waterpower sites on government land
were issued by the forest service and the policy which is just being
adopted by the interior department and other government organizations in
their handling of waterpower questions was there first developed these
permits are prepared in the branch of lands the first steps toward
deterring men who attempt in defiance of the law to get possession of
lands claimed to be agricultural or mineral within the national forests
are taken here but the final decision on these points rests with the
department of the interior the examination of lands to determine
whether they are agricultural in character and therefore should be
opened to settlement is directed from this branch

the uses to which national forest lands are put are almost unbelievably
various barns borrow pits botanical gardens cemeteries and churches
dairies and dipping vats fox ranches and fish hatcheries hotels
pastures pipe lines power sites residences sanitaria and
school-houses stores and tunnels these and many others make up with
grazing and timber sales the uses of the national forests for which
already more than half a million permits have been issued this work
also falls to the branch of lands

the sixth branch that of forest products is concerned with the whole
question of the uses of wood and other materials produced by the forest
its principal work is conducted through the forest products laboratory
in coöperation with the university of wisconsin at madison here timber
is tested to ascertain its strength the products of wood distillation
are investigated wood pulp and paper studies of large reach are carried
on the methods of wood preservation and the results of applying them
are in constant course of being examined and the diseases of trees and
of wood are studied in coöperation with the bureau of plant industry of
the united states department of agriculture the consumption of wood
and the production of lumber and forest products are also the subject
of continuous investigation and various necessary special studies are
undertaken from time to time at the moment an effort is under way to
find new uses and new markets for wood killed by the chestnut blight in
the northeastern united states

the seventh branch has to do with the study selection and acquisition
of lands under the weeks law in accordance with which eight million
dollars was appropriated for the purchase of forest lands valuable for
stream protection with particular reference to the southern
appalachians and the white mountains of new england the examination of
the amount of merchantable timber on lands under consideration for
purchase the study of the character of the land and the forest and the
survey of the land keep a numerous body of young men very fully
occupied their task is to see that none but the right land is
recommended for acquisition by the government that the nature and value
of the lands selected shall be most thoroughly known and that the
constant effort to make the government pay unreasonable prices or
purchase under unfavorable conditions shall as constantly be defeated
the same branch takes charge of the lands as soon as they have been
acquired

the foregoing description of the work which is done in washington by the
forest service may help to make clear the great variety of tasks to
which a forester may be required to set his hand and emphasizes the
need of a broad training not strictly confined to purely technical
lines it would be defective as a description however and would fail
to show the spirit in which the work is done if no mention were made of
the service meeting at which the responsible heads of each branch and
of the work of the foresters office meet once a week to discuss every
problem which confronts the service and every phase of its work this
meeting is the centre where all parts of the work of the service come
together and arrange their mutual coöperation and it is also the spring
from which the essential democracy of the organization takes its rise
the service meeting is the best thing in the forest service and that is
saying a great deal

it must not be imagined that the maintenance of forest service
headquarters in washington indicates that the actual business of
handling the national forests is carried on at long range in order to
avoid any such possibility the six district offices were organized in
 these are situated at missoula denver albuquerque portland
ogden and san francisco each of the district offices is in charge of a
district forester who directs the practical carrying out of the
policies finally determined upon in washington after consultation with
the men in the field the execution of all the work the larger features
of which the washington office decides and directs and the details of
which it inspects is the task of the district forester the district
foresters office is necessarily organized much on the same general
lines as the washington headquarters thus the subjects of accounts
operation silviculture grazing lands and forest products are all
represented in the district offices in addition a legal officer is
necessarily attached to each district office and each district forester
has in his district one or more forest experiment stations employed
mainly in studying questions of growth and reproduction and three
forest insect field stations maintained in coöperation with the bureau
of entomology are divided among the six districts

illustration forest rangers getting instruction in methods of work
from a district forest officer

while the work of the washington office is mainly that of guiding the
work of the national forests along broad general lines through
instructions to the district foresters the office of each district
forester deals directly with the forest supervisors and so with the
handling of the national forests a multitude of questions which the
supervisors can not answer are decided in the district office instead
as was formerly the case of being forwarded to washington for disposal
there with the consequent aggravating and needless delay the
establishment of the district offices has made the handling of the
national forests far less complicated and far more prompt and has
brought it far closer than ever before to the actual usersthat is
has made it far more quickly and accurately responsive to their needs




private 


as yet the practice of  by private owners except for fire
protection has made but little progress in the united states although
without doubt it will be widely extended during the next ten or fifteen
years the concentration of timberland ownership in the united states
has put a few men in control of vast areas of forest many of them are
anxious to prevent forest destruction so far as that may be practicable
without interfering with their profits and for that purpose foresters
are beginning to be employed until now the principal tasks of foresters
employed by lumbermen have been the measurement of the amount of lumber
in the standing crop of trees and the protection of forest lands from
fire here and there the practice of a certain amount of  has
been added but this part of the work of the private forester employed
by lumbermen has not been important it is likely however to increase
with some rapidity before long in the meantime the private forester
must usually be willing to accept a good many limitations on the
technical side of his work

it is essential for the forester thus employed to have or promptly to
acquire a knowledge of practical lumbering that is of logging
milling and markets and for the forest student who expects to enter
this work to give special attention to these subjects

already about  graduates of forest schools are in private employ a
considerable proportion of which number are employed by large lumbermen

the time is undoubtedly coming and I hope it may come soon when forest
destruction will be legally recognized as hostile to the public welfare
and when lumbermen will be compelled by law to handle their forests so
as to insure the reproduction of them under reasonable conditions and
within a reasonable time the idea is neither tyrannical nor new in
democratic switzerland private owners of timberland are restrained by
law from destroying the forests upon which the welfare of that mountain
region so largely depends and if they disobey their forest lands are
replanted by the government at the owners expense

another opening for foresters in the employ of lumbermen is through the
forest fire protective associations of these two stand out most
conspicuously at the present time one the northwestern conservation and
 association the other the oregon forest fire association each
has as its executive officer a trained forester whose knowledge of the
woods not only makes him exceedingly useful to his employers but also
when combined with the foresters point of view enables him to be of
great value in protecting the general interest in the forest

the object and methods of one of the associations is described by its
secretary as follows

a field hitherto narrow but continually broadening and offering much
opportunity for those with peculiar qualifications is the management of
the coöperative forest work carried on by timber owners in many
localities often jointly with state and government this movement
originated in the pacific northwest where it still has the highest
development but is extending to the lake states new england and
canada

as a rule the primary object of these coöperative associations is fire
prevention and their local managers must have demonstrated ability to
organize effective patrol systems build telephone lines apply every
ingenuity to supplying and equipping their forces and above all to
handle men in emergencies but in most cases the association of forest
owners to this end has led also to progress in many other matters
inseparable from improvement such as study of reforestation
possibilities forest legislation educating lumberman and public in
forest preservation and the extension of coöperation in all these as
well as in fire prevention from private to state and federal agencies

the development of such activities is already employing several highly
paid men who can command the confidence not only of forest owners but
also of the public and of public officials advisers in legislative as
well as technical  matters and particularly proficient in all
that pertains to forest protection their usefulness lies as much
outside their own association as within them and to be successful they
must be skilful organizers and campaigners it is these men who have
developed to its highest extent the adaptation to  propaganda of
modern publicity and advertising methods

as a rule however these may be described as graduate positions
filled by men of experience and acquaintance with the several agencies
involved rather than by newly fledged foresters a practical knowledge
of protection problems is essential

 associations offer a different but often a most fascinating
field of work for the trained forester there are at present  such
associations the work which they offer has much in common with the
duties of a state forester

fish and game associations are beginning to employ foresters realizing
that the wise handling of the forests may well go hand in hand with the
care of the game and fish which the forest shelters and protects
eventually nearly all such associations which control any considerable
body of land in timbered regions may be expected to utilize the services
of trained foresters of their own

in addition to the work for lumbermen and for associations of various
kinds land owners in considerable variety have begun to employ
foresters among these are coal and coke companies iron companies wood
pulp and paper companies which are beginning to look after their supply
of timber powder arms and ammunition companies hydraulic and water
companies a great corporation engaged in the manufacture of matches
and a number of railroads including the delaware and hudson the
illinois central and the pennsylvania in addition to the need for
cross ties railroads are among the largest consumers of lumber the
foresters who work for them are largely occupied with growing the wood
supplies which the railroads need and nursery practice often occupies a
very large share of their attention




forest schools


since the first one was founded in  the number of forest schools in
the united states has increased so rapidly as to create a demand for
forest instructors which it has been exceedingly difficult to fill
indeed the increase in secondary forest schools or schools not of the
first grade has doubtless been more rapid than the welfare of the
profession or the sound practice of  required and the brisk
demand for teachers has led some men to take up the task of instruction
who were not well fitted for it

there are in this country to-day  forest schools which prepare men for
the practice of  as a profession and  schools which devote
themselves to general instruction in  or to courses for forest
rangers and forest guards the approximate number of teachers in all
forest schools is at present  and this number will doubtless be
still further increased by the addition of new forest schools or the
expansion of old ones while a certain number of places will be made
vacant by the retirement of men who find themselves better fitted for
other lines of work

the teaching staff at three of the principal forest schools of the
country is as follows

at school a  men give their whole time to forest instruction and 
give courses in the forest school

schools b and c have each  men who give their whole time to the work
and  and  respectively who give lectures or individual courses

in addition to the work for lumbermen associations railroads and
others just mentioned an increasing number of foresters are required to
care for the forests on large landed estates in different parts of the
country work of this kind is at present restricted almost entirely to
the east and especially to new england where several firms of
consulting foresters give to it the larger portion of their time some
of the men thus employed are as fully occupied with the tasks of the
professional forester as any of the men in the government service while
others give a part of their attention to the general management of the
property or to the protection and propagation of game and fish




the opportunity


government service

there is no more useful profession than  the opportunity to
make himself count in affairs of public importance comes earlier and
more certainly to the forester than to the member of any other
profession the first and most valuable therefore of the incentives
which lead the forester to his choice is the chance to make himself of
use to his country and to his generation

but if this is the first matter to be considered in deciding upon a
profession it is by no means the last and the practical considerations
of a fair return for good work bread and butter for a man and his
family the certainty or uncertainty of employmentsuch questions as
these must have their full share of attention

there are in the united states forest service  forest guards 
forest rangers  supervisors and deputy supervisors and  forest
assistants and  forest examiners who as already explained are the
technical men in charge of practical  on the national forests
the six district offices together include in their membership about 
professional foresters and about  more are attached to the
headquarters at washington so that allowing for duplications there are
about  trained foresters in the united states forest service

the number of new appointments to the forest service in the different
permanent grades varies from year to year but may be said to be
approximately as follows rangers  new appointments forest
assistants  other technical positions  all appointments as
supervisor are by promotion from the lists of forest rangers or forest
examiners

the yearly pay of the forest guard who like the ranger must be a
citizen of the state in which his work lies is from  to 
forest rangers who enter the service through civil service examination
receive from  to  per annum forest supervisors practically
all of whom are men of long experience in forest work receive from
 to  per annum forest assistants enter the forest service
through civil service examination at a salary of  per annum and
are promoted to a maximum salary of  per annum as forest
examiners professional foresters at work in the district offices are
recruited mainly from among the forest assistants and examiners they
receive from  to  yearly the technical men in charge at
washington get from  to  per annum which last is the pay of
the forester at the head of the service


state service

the pay of the state foresters or other trained foresters in charge of
state work ranges from  to  and that of their technical
assistants from  to  out of the total number only  are
directly in charge of their own work responsible only to the governor
and the legislature while  act as subordinates for state forest
commissions or commissioners who in the majority of cases are political
appointees in striking contrast with the united states forest service
politics has so far been a dangerous if not a dominating influence in
the forest work of most of the states which have undertaken it

like the national forests the state forests already in existence will
create an increasing demand for the service of technical foresters
indeed as similar forests are acquired by most of the states which are
now without them as undoubtedly they will be the extent of the
opportunity for professionally trained foresters in state work is
certain to grow


private work

at present the demand for foresters in private work is far less
pressing and the opening is far less attractive than it will be in the
not distant future the number of men that will be required for this
work will depend on the development of legislation as well as upon the
desire of the private owners lumbermen and others to protect and
improve their property the time is coming and coming before long when
all private owners of forests in the mountains or on steep slopes
elsewhere will be required by law to provide for their protection and
reproduction when that time arrives the demand for foresters in
private work will increase to very large dimensions and will probably
do so far more rapidly than foresters can be trained to supply it

the pay of foresters in private work whether in the employ of
lumbermen railroads shooting and fishing clubs the proprietors of
large private estates or other forest owners has so far been somewhat
better than that for similar services in government employ this money
difference in favor of private employment is in my judgment likely to
continue and eventually the pay of consulting foresters of established
reputation employed in passing upon the value of forests offered as
security for investments or in estimating the standing timber for
purchasers or sellers or in other professional work of large business
importance will certainly reach very satisfactory figures


teaching

approximately  foresters are engaged in teaching in the united states
to-day their pay varies from about  to about  and is likely
to increase rather more rapidly than that of other professional
teachers since less of them are available it is not likely however
that the number of openings in teaching  will be large within
the next ten years




training


the length of time which his training is to take and the particular
courses of instruction which the shall pursue are to the young man
contemplating the study of  matters of the first importance the
first thing to insist on in that connection is that the training must be
thorough it is natural that a young man should be eager to begin his
life work and therefore somewhat impatient of the long grind of a
thorough schooling but however natural it is not the part of wisdom to
cut short the time of preparation when the serious work of the trained
forester begins later on there will be little or no time to fill the
gaps left at school and the earnest desire of the young forester will
be that the had spent more time in his preparation rather than less in
this matter I speak as one who has gathered a conviction from personal
experience and believes the knows

it would be useless to attempt to strike an average of the work
prescribed and the courses given at the various forest schools I shall
describe therefore not an average system of instruction but one which
in the judgment of men entitled to an opinion and in my own judgment
is sound practical and effective

forest schools may roughly be divided between those which do not prepare
men for professional work in  and those which do the latter
may be divided again into undergraduate schools and graduate schools
most of the former offer a four-year undergraduate course and their
students receive their degrees at the same time as other members of the
university who entered at the same time with them the graduate schools
require a college degree or its equivalent in certain subjects before
they will receive a student the men who have completed their courses
have usually therefore pursued more extensive and more advanced
studies in  are better trained and are themselves older and
more ready to accept the responsibilities which  brings upon
them for these reasons the graduate school training is by far the more
desirable in my opinion

the subjects required for entrance to a graduate forest school should
include at least one full year in college botany covering the general
morphology histology and physiology of plants one course each in
geology physics inorganic chemistry zoölogy and economics with
mathematics through trigonometry and a reading knowledge of french or
german some acquaintance with mechanical drawing is also desirable but
not absolutely necessary other courses which are extremely desirable
if not altogether essential are mineralogy meteorology mechanics
physical geography organic chemistry and possibly calculus which may
be of use in timber physics

one or two forest schools begin their course of training for the first
year in july instead of in october in order to give their students some
acquaintance with the woods from the foresters standpoint before the
more formal courses begin the result of this plan is to give increased
vividness and reality to all the courses which follow the work in the
woods to make clear the application of what is taught and so to add
greatly to the efficiency of the teaching

in addition to this preliminary touch with the woods any wise plan of
teaching will include many forest excursions and much practical field
work as vitally important parts of the instruction this outdoor work
should occur throughout the whole course winter and summer and in
addition the last term of the senior year may well be spent wholly in
the woods where the students can be trained in the management of
logging operations and milling and can get their final practice work in
surveying and map-making in preparing forest working plans estimating
timber laying out roads and trails making plans for lumber operations
and other similar practical work several of the best forest schools
have adopted this plan

the regular courses of a graduate forest school usually cover a period
of two years they should fit a student for nearly every phase of
professional work in  and should give him a sound preparation
not merely for practical work in the woods but also for the broader
work of forest organization in the government service in the united
states and in the philippines and in the service of the states for
handling large tracts of private forest lands for expert work in the
employ of lumbermen and other forest owners for public speaking and
writing for teaching and for scientific research

every well equipped forest school will have a working library of books
pamphlets and lumber journals published here and abroad an herbarium
at least of native trees and shrubs and of the more important forest
herbs together with a collection of forest tree fruits and seeds and
specimens of domestic and foreign timbers exhibits showing the uses of
woods and the various forms of tools used in lumbering as well as the
apparatus for laboratory work and surveying and forest instruments for
work in the field are often of great value to the student

what should a young man learn at a forest school doubtless there will
be some variation of opinion as to the exact course of study which will
best fit him for the work of a forester in the united states the
following list expresses the best judgment on the subject I have been
able to form


dendrology

the first step in  is to become acquainted with the various
kinds of trees the coming forester must learn to identify the woody
plants of the united states both in summer and in winter the must
understand their shapes and outward structures and where they are
found and the must begin his knowledge of the individual habits of
growth and life which distinguish the trees which are important in



forest physiography

trees grow in the soil it is important to know something of the origin
of soils and their properties and values and of the principal soil
types with special reference to their effect upon plant distribution
and welfare the origin nature value and conservation of humus that
most essential ingredient of the forest floor the field methods of
mapping soil types the rock types most important in their relation to
soils how they are made up how they make soil and where they
occursomething should be learned of all this finally under this
head the student ought to get a usable knowledge of the physiographic
regions of the united states their boundaries geologic structure
topography drainage and soilsall this naturally with special
reference to the relation between these basic facts and the forest


silviculture

silviculture is the art of caring for forests and therefore the
backbone of  it is based upon silvics which is the knowledge
of the habits or behavior of trees in their relations to light heat
and moisture to the air and soil and to each other it is the facts
embraced in silvics which explain the composition character and form
of the forest the success or failure of tree species in competition
with each other the distribution of trees and of forests the
development of each tree in height diameter and volume its form and
length of life the methods of its reproduction and the effect of all
these upon the nature and the evolution of the city of trees and upon
forest types and their life histories

this is knowledge the forester can not do without silvics is the
foundation of his professional capacity and as a student the can better
afford to scamp any part of his training rather than this a man may be
a poor forester who knows silvics but no man can be a good forester who
does not

the practice of silviculture has to do with the treatment of woodlands
the forest student must learn the different methods of reproducing
forests by different methods of cutting them down and the application
of these methods in different american forest regions there are also
many methods of cutting for the improvement of the character and growth
of forests as well as for utilizing material that otherwise would go to
waste before the final reproduction cuttings can be made the ways in
which forests need protection are equally numerous and of these by far
the most important in our country have to do with methods of preventing
or extinguishing forest fires

well managed forests are handled under working plans based on the
silvical character and silvicultural needs of the forest as well as
upon the purpose set by the owner as the object of management which is
often closely related to questions of forest finance the student should
ground himself thoroughly in the making of silvicultural working plans
and the more practice in making them the can get the better so too
with the marking of trees in reproduction and improvement cuttings under
as many different kinds of forest conditions as may be possible

the artificial reproduction of forests is likely to occupy far more of
the foresters attention in the future than it has in the past hence
the collection of tree seeds their fertility and vitality as affecting
their handling the best methods of seeding and planting and the
lessons of past failures and successes with the whole subject of
nursery work and the care of young plantations must by no means be
overlooked

much incidental information on the subject of forest protection will
come to the student in the course of his studies but special attention
should be given to learning which of the species of forest insects are
most injurious to forest vegetation how their attacks are made how
they may be discovered and the best ways by which such attacks can be
mitigated or controlled so also the diseases of timber trees will repay
hard study the principal fungI which causes such diseases should be
known how they attack the trees and what are the remedies as well as
although this is far less important the way to treat tree wounds and
the correct methods of pruning


forest economics

forest economics is a large subject it deals with the productive value
of forests to their owners and with the larger question of their place
in the economy of the nation it considers their use as conservers of
the soil and the streams their effect on climate locally as in the
case of windbreakers and on a larger scale and their contribution to
the public welfare as recreation grounds and game refuges it includes a
knowledge of wastes from which the forests suffer and the consequent
loss to industry and to the public and in this it does not omit the
effects of forest fires statistics of forest consumption the relation
of the forest to railroads mines and other wood-using industries its
effect upon agriculture stock raising and manufacturing industries
and its effect upon the use of the streams for navigation power
irrigation and domestic water supply all these are important the
student should consider also the forest resources of the united states
their present condition and the needs they must be fitted to supply


forest engineering

forest engineering is steadily becoming more and more necessary to the
forester the must have a working knowledge of the use of surveying
instruments the making of topographic surveys the office work required
of an engineer the making of topographic maps the location of trails
roads and railroads and the construction of bridges telephone lines
cabins and fences together with logging railroads slides dams and
flumes


forest mensuration

illustration forest service men making fresh measurements in the
missourI swamps

forest mensuration the art of measuring the contents and growth of
trees and forest stands is of fundamental importance the principles
and methods of timber estimating the actual measurement of standing
timber log rules the making of stem analyses to show the increase of a
tree in diameter height and volume the construction of tables of
current and mean annual growth per acre and per tree and the methods of
using the information thus formulatedall these are necessarily of
keen interest to the man who later on will have to apply his knowledge
in the practical management of woods


forest management

forest management is concerned with the principles involved in planning
the handling of forests questions of the valuation of forests form a
most essential part of itsuch questions as the cost of growing timber
crops the value of land for that purpose the value of young timber
the valuation of damage to the forest and the legal status of the
damage and the remedy

business principles are as necessary in the management of forests as in
the management of mills or farms these business principles work out in
different forms of forest policy adapted to the needs of different kinds
of owners such as lumbermen and the government what the young forester
has learned about growth and yield about timber estimates and forest
statistics and many other matters all finds its application in forest
management the must also consider the methods and principles for
regulating the cut of timber or for securing sustained annual yields
all this forms the basis for the preparation of working plans for the
utilization of forests under american economic and silvicultural
conditions not only without injury but with benefit to their
continued productiveness

the subjects of forest surveying and working plans are intimately
related maps are indispensable in the practical work of making a forest
working plan topographic mapping timber estimating forest
description and the location of logging roads trails and fire lines
together with silvics and a knowledge of growth and yieldthese and
many other subjects enter into the making of a practical working plan to
harvest a forest crop and secure a second growth of timber the student
should get all the practice the can in marking timber for cutting under
such a plan

the young forester must make himself familiar with the administration of
the national forests the must know how the business of the forest is
handled how it is protected against fire how the timber is sold how
claims and entries are dealt with under the public land laws how land
in the national forests is used to make homes how trespass is
controlled how the livestock industry on the national forests is
fostered and regulated and how the extremely valuable watersheds they
contain are safeguarded and improved


the practice of 

the practice of  is necessarily different in different kinds of
forests and under different economic conditions all that the forester
knows must here be applied and applied in workable fashion not only to
the forest but to the men who use the forest this is peculiarly true
of the practice of  in national and state forests everywhere


forest products

under this general subject the forest student must acquaint himself
through the microscope with the minute anatomy of the woody stem of
coniferous and broadleaf trees and the occurrence form structure and
variability of the elements which make it up the should become familiar
with the methods of classifying the economic woods of the united states
both under the microscope and with the unassisted eye and for this
purpose should know something of their color gloss grain density
odor and resonance both as aids to identification and as to their
importance in giving value to the wood the defects of timber its
moisture content density shrinking checking warping and the effect
of all these upon its uses

the chemical composition of wood and of minor forest products such as
tannins and dye stuffs is important the properties governing the fuel
value and the other values of wood must be studied as well as the
methods of using these properties in the making of charcoal and wood
pulp in wood distillation the turpentine industry in tanning and
dyeing and in other industries

a field of great importance is the relation between the physical
structure and the mechanical properties of wood a student should inform
himself concerning the standard methods of testing the properties of
structural timber by bending compression shearing torsion impact
and the hardness and tension tests with their relation to heat and
moisture and the methods of seasoning the use of preservatives and
the effect of the rate of application of the load

woods vary as to their durability it is important therefore to know
about the causes of decay the decay-resisting power of various woods
the relation of moisture content to durability why the seasoning of
wood is effective the theory and the commercial methods of wood
preservation and its relation to the timber supply


lumbering

lumbering the forester should know more than a little about as how to
organize lumber operations the equipment and management of logging and
milling in various forest regions the manufacture seasoning and
grading of the rough and finished lumber cost keeping in a lumber
business methods of sale market requirements at home and abroad
prices the relation of the lumber tariff to  lumber
associations timber bonds and insurance the practical construction of
logging equipment such as aerial tramways log slides dams and
flumes is of peculiar importance and so are the conditions and changes
of the lumber market

experience on the land of some operating lumber company is of great
value it should include a study of logging methods log scaling waste
in logging the equipment and handling of the mill the sawing and care
of rough and finished lumber its grading and so far as possible an
acquaintance with wood working plants of various kinds and with the
operations of turpentine orcharding studies along these lines may with
advantage be almost indefinitely extended to include for example the
utilization of steam machinery for logging the improvement of streams
for driving logs and other similar questions


forest law

the forester must have at least a slight acquaintance with forest law
both state and national it is important to know something of the
general principles of classifying the public lands of state laws for
fire protection the development of forest policies in the various
states as legally expressed and the important laws which govern the
creation and management of state forest reserves

forest taxation state and local which has when excessive so much to
do with hastening forest destruction is one of the most important
questions which can engage the attention of the forester

under the subject of federal forest law it is not sufficient for the
student to acquaint himself with those laws alone which govern the
forests the must also have some knowledge of the creation of a forest
policy out of the public land policy of the united states some
acquaintance with the public land laws a good working knowledge of the
laws and regulations governing the national forests is indispensable
and the student should at least know where to find the more important
court decisions by which they are interpreted


forest history

the history of  in europe has a certain importance in throwing
light on our own forest history and its probable development and this
is especially true of the history of the administration of government
forest lands and of education in 

the history of  in the united states however is far more
important the forester must know the story of the growth and change of
national forest organizations the forest officers and their duties the
cost size and effectiveness of the government forest service at
different times the civil service regulations under which it is
recruited and other similar matters it is important likewise for him
to become thoroughly saturated with an intimate knowledge of the
development of  in public opinion in the united states its
extension to the other natural resources through the conservation
policy and the relation of the foresters point of view thus expressed
to the present welfare and future success of the nation

it is not always possible for the forest student to become a woodsman
before entering his profession but it is most desirable a forester
must be able to travel the forest alone by day and by night the should
be a good fisherman and a good hunter which is far more important than
to be a good shot and deeply interested in both fish and game the
better horseman the is the better forester the will be and especially if
he can pack and handle pack horses in the woods so that whether the
young forester begins with a practical knowledge of woodcraft or not he
must not fail to acquire or improve it for without it the will endanger
the whole success of his career

some knowledge of first aid to the injured is likely to be of great and
sudden value to a man so much of whose life must be spent in the woods
at a distance from medical aid the time spent in getting information on
this subject will be anything but wasted


english

the ability to write and to speak good plain understandable english is
a prime requisite in the foresters training it is a part of education
frequently neglected especially by those in engineering or scientific
pursuits yet its importance for the forester is very large as already
pointed out the forester is on the firing line of the conservation
movement the is pioneering in a new profession for this reason the will
often need to explain his stand and convert others to his beliefs in
addition the must make available to others the results the secures from
the study of new facts a usable command of his own language will stand
him in good stead whether the needs to talk face to face with another
man or from a platform to a concourse of people or to put into
readable printed form the results of his observations or his thinking

when the young forester has completed the courses of his school training
in america the question may be raised whether the should supplement his
training by study abroad I am strongly of opinion that the should do so
if the can study abroad is not indispensable for the american forester
but it can do him nothing but good to see in practical operation the
methods of  which have resulted from the long experience of
other lands and especially to become familiar with the effect of sound
 on the forest




the disobedient woodpecker


long long ago at the beginning of things they say that the lord made
the world smooth and round like an apple there were no hills nor
mountains nor were there any hollows or valleys to hold the seas and
rivers fountains and pools which the world of men would need it must
indeed have been a stupid and ugly earth in those days with no chance
for swimming or sailing rowing or fishing but as yet there was no one
to think anything about it no one who would long to swim sail row
and fish for this was long before men were created

the lord looked about him at the flocks of newly made birds who were
preening their wings and wondering at their own bright feathers and
said to himself

I will make these pretty creatures useful from the very beginning so
that in after time men shall love them dearly come my birds he
cried come hither to me and with the beaks which I have given you
hollow me out here and here and here basins for the lakes and
pools which I intend to fill with water for men and for you their
friends come little brothers busy yourselves as you would wish to be
happy hereafter

then there was a twittering and fluttering as the good birds set to work
with a will singing happily over the work which their dear lord had
given them to do they pecked and they pecked with their sharp little
bills they scratched and they scratched with their sharp little claws
till in the proper places they had hollowed out great basins and valleys
and long river beds and little holes in the ground

then the lord sent great rains upon the earth until the hollows which
the birds had made were filled with water and so became rivers and
lakes little brooks and fountains just as we see them to-day now it
was a beautiful beautiful world and the good birds sang happily and
rejoiced in the work which they had helped and in the sparkling water
which was sweet to their taste

all were happy except one the woodpecker had taken no part with the
other busy birds she was a lazy disobedient creature and when she
heard the lords commands she had only said tut tut and sat still on
the branch where she had perched preening her pretty feathers and
admiring her silver stockings you can toil if you want to she said
to the other birds who wondered at her but I shall do no such dirty
work my clothes are too fine

now when the world was quite finished and the beautiful water sparkled
and glinted here and there cool and refreshing the lord called the
birds to him and thanked them for their help praising them for their
industry and zeal but to the woodpecker the said

as for you o woodpecker I observe that your feathers are unruffled by
work and that there is no spot of soil upon your beak and claws how did
you manage to keep so neat

the woodpecker looked sulky and stood upon one leg

it is a good thing to be neat said the lord but not if it comes
from shirking a duty it is good to be dainty but not from laziness
have you not worked with your brothers as I commanded you

it was such very dirty work piped the woodpecker crossly I was
afraid of spoiling my pretty bright coat and my silver shining hose

oh vain and lazy bird said the lord sadly have you nothing to do
but show off your fine clothes and give yourself airs you are no more
beautiful than many of your brothers yet they all obeyed me willingly
look at the snow-white dove and the gorgeous bird of paradise and the
pretty grosbeak they have worked nobly yet their plumage is not
injured I fear that you must be punished for your disobedience little
woodpecker henceforth you shall wear stockings of sooty black instead
of the shining silver ones of which you are so proud you who were too
fine to dig in the earth shall ever be pecking at dusty wood and as you
declined to help in building the water-basins of the world so you shall
never sip from them when you are thirsty never shall you thrust beak
into lake or river little rippling brook or cool sweet fountain
raindrops falling scantily from the leaves shall be your drink and your
voice shall be heard only when other creatures are hiding themselves
from the approaching storm

it was a sad punishment for the woodpecker but she certainly deserved
it ever since that time whenever we hear a little tap-tapping in the
tree city we know that it is the poor woodpecker digging at the dusty
wood as the lord said she should do and when we spy her a dusty
little body with black stockings clinging upright to the tree trunk we
see that she is creeping climbing looking up eagerly toward the sky
longing for the rain to fall into her thirsty beak she is always hoping
for the storm to come and plaintively pipes plui-pluI rain o
rain until the drops begin to patter on the leaves




mother magpies kindergarten


did you ever notice how different are the nests which the birds build in
springtime in tree or bush or sandy bank or hidden in the grass some
are wonderfully wrought pretty little homes for birdikins but others
are clumsy and carelessly fastened to the bough most unsafe cradles
for the feathered baby on the treetop sometimes after a heavy wind you
find on the ground under the nest poor little broken eggs which rolled
out and lost their chance of turning into birds with safe safe wings of
their own now such sad things as this happen because in their youth the
lazy father and mother birds did not learn their lesson when mother
magpie had her class in nest-making the clumsiest nest of all is that
which the wood-pigeon tries to build indeed it is not a nest at all
only the beginning of one and there is an old story about this which i
shall tell you

in the early springtime of the world when birds were first made none
of themexcept mother magpieknew how to build a nest in that lovely
garden where they lived the birds went fluttering about trying their new
wings so interested in this wonderful game of flying that they forgot
all about preparing a home for the baby birds who were to come when the
time came to lay their eggs the parents knew not what to do there was
no place safe from the four-legged creatures who cannot fly and they
began to twitter helplessly oh how I wish I had a nice warm nest for
my eggs oh what shall we do for a home dear me I dont know
anything about housekeeping and the poor silly things ruffled up their
feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is
unhappy

all except mother magpie she was not the bestoh nobut she was the
cleverest and wisest of all the birds it seemed as if she knew
everything that a bird could know already she had found out a way and
was busily building a famous nest for herself she was indeed a clever
bird she gathered turf and sticks and with clay bound them firmly
together in a stout elm tree about her house she built a fence of
thorns to keep away the burglar birds who had already begun mischief
among their peaceful neighbors thus she had a snug and cosy dwelling
finished before the others even suspected what she was doing she popped
into her new house and sat there comfortably peering out through the
window-slits with her sharp little eyes and she saw the other birds
hopping about and twittering helplessly

what silly birds they are she croaked ha ha what would they not
give for a nest like mine

but presently a sharp-eyed sparrow spied mother magpie sitting in her
nest

oho look there the cried mother magpie has found a way let us ask
her to teach us

then all the other birds chirped eagerly yes yes let us ask her to
teach us

so in a great company they came fluttering hopping twittering up to
the elm tree where mother magpie nestled comfortably in her new house

o wise mother magpie dear mother magpie they cried teach us how to
build our nests like yours for it is growing night and we are tired
and sleepy

the magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient
diligent obedient class of little birds and they all promised that
they would

she made them perch about her in a great circle some on the lower
branches of the trees some on the bushes and some on the ground among
the grass and flowers and where each bird perched there it was to
build its nest then mother magpie found clay and bits of twigs and moss
and grasseverything a bird could need to build a nest and there is
scarcely anything you can think of which some bird would not find very
useful when these things were all piled up before her she told every
bird to do just as she did it was like a great big kindergarten of
birds playing at a new building game with mother magpie for the
teacher

she began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into
nests as they should be made and some of the birds who were attentive
and careful soon saw how it was done and started nice homes for
themselves you have seen what wonderful swinging baskets the oriole
makes for his baby-cradle well it was the magpie who taught him how
and the was the prize pupil to be sure but some of the birds were not
like him nor like the patient little wren some of them were lazy and
stupid and envious of mother magpies cosy nest which was already
finished while theirs was yet to do

as mother magpie worked showing them how it seemed so very simple that
they were ashamed not to have discovered it for themselves so as she
went on bit by bit the silly things pretended that they had known all
about it from the firstwhich was very unpleasant for their teacher

mother magpie took two sticks in her beak and began like this first of
all my friends you must lay two sticks crosswise for a foundation
thus and she placed them carefully on the branch before her

oh yes oh yes croaked old daddy crow interrupting her rudely i
thought that was the way to begin

mother magpie snapped her eyes at him and went on next you must lay a
feather on a bit of moss to start the walls

certainly of course screamed the jackdaw I knew that came next
that is what I told the parrot but a moment since

mother magpie looked at him impatiently but she did not say anything
then my friends you must place on your foundation moss hair
feathers sticks and grasswhatever you choose for your house you
must place them like this

yes yes cried the starling sticks and grass every one knows how
to do that of course of course tell us something new

illustration next you must lay a feather

now mother magpie was very angry but she kept on with her lesson in
spite of these rude and silly interruptions she turned toward the
wood-pigeon who was a rattle-pated young thing and who was not having
any success with the sticks which she was trying to place

here wood-pigeon said mother magpie you must place those sticks
through and across criss-cross criss-cross so

criss-cross criss-cross so interrupted the wood-pigeon I know
that will do-o-o that will do-o-o

mother magpie hopped up and down on one leg so angry she could hardly
croak

you silly pigeon she sputtered not so you are spoiling your
nest place the sticks so

I know I know that will do-o-o that will do-o-o cooed the
wood-pigeon obstinately in her soft foolish little voice without
paying the least attention to mother magpies directions

we all know thatanything more chirped the chorus of birds trying
to conceal how anxious they were to know what came next for the nests
were only half finished

but mother magpie was thoroughly disgusted and refused to go on with
the lesson which had been so rudely interrupted by her pupils

you are all so wise friends she said that surely you do not need
any help from me you say you know all about itthen go on and finish
your nests by yourselves much luck may you have and away she flew to
her own cosy nest in the elm tree where she was soon fast asleep
forgetting all about the matter

but oh what a pickle the other birds were in the lesson was but half
finished and most of them had not the slightest idea what to do next
that is why to this day many of the birds have never learned to build a
perfect nest some do better than others but none build like mother
magpie

but the wood-pigeon was in the worst case of them all for she had only
the foundation laid criss-cross as the magpie had shown her and so if
you find in the woods the most shiftless silly kind of nest that you
can imaginejust a platform of sticks laid flat across a branch with
no railing to keep the eggs from rolling out no roof to keep the rain
from soaking inwhen you see that foolishness you will know that it is
the nest of little mistress wood-pigeon who was too stupid to learn the
lesson which mother magpie was ready to teach

and the queerest part of all is that the birds blamed the magpie for the
whole matter and have never liked her since but as you may have
found out for yourselves that is often the fate of wise folk who make
discoveries or who do things better than others




the gorgeous goldfinch


the goldfinch who lives in europe is one of the gaudiest of the little
feathered brothers the is a very joseph of birds in his coat of many
colors and folk often wonder how the came to have feathers so much more
gorgeous than his kindred but after you have read this tale you will
wonder no longer

you must know that when the father first made all the birds they were
dressed alike in plumage of sober gray but this dull uniform pleased
him no more than it did the birds themselves who begged that they might
wear each the particular style which was most becoming and by which
they could be recognized afar

so the father called the birds to him one by one as they stood in
line and dipping his brush in the rainbow color-box painted each
appropriately in the colors which it wears to-day except indeed that
some had later adventures which altered their original hues as you
shall hear in due season

but the goldfinch did not come with the other birds that tardy little
fellow was busy elsewhere on his own affairs and heeded not the fathers
command to fall in line and wait his turn for being made beautiful

so it happened that not until the painting was finished and all the
birds had flown away to admire themselves in the water-mirrors of the
earth did the goldfinch present himself at the fathers feet out of
breath

o father the panted I am late but I was so busy pray forgive me
and permit me to have a pretty coat like the others

you are late indeed said the father reproachfully and all the
coloring has been done you should have come when I bade you do you not
know that it is the prompt bird who fares best my rainbow color-box has
been generously used and I have but little of each tint left yet i
will paint you with the colors that I have and if the result be ill you
have only yourself to blame

the father smiled gently as the took up the brush which the had laid down
and dipped it in the first color which came to hand this the used until
there was no more when the began with another shade and so continued
until the goldfinch was completely colored from head to foot such a
gorgeous coat his forehead and throat were of the most brilliant
crimson his cap and sailor collar were black his back was brown and
yellow his breast white his wings golden set off with velvet black
and his tail was black with white-tipped feathers certainly there was
no danger of his being mistaken for any other bird

when the goldfinch looked down into a pool and saw the reflection of his
gorgeous coat the burst out into a song of joy I like it oh I like
it the warbled and his song was very sweet oh I am glad that I was
late indeed I am dear father

but the kind father sighed and shook his head as the put away the brush
exclaiming poor little goldfinch you are indeed a beautiful bird but
I fear that the gorgeous coat which you wear and which is the best that
I could give you because you came so late will cause you more sorrow
than joy because of it you will be chased and captured and kept in
captivity and your life will be spent in mourning for the days when you
were a plain gray bird

and so it happened for to this day the goldfinch is persecuted by human
folk who admire his wonderful plumage and his beautiful song the is
kept captive in a cage while his less gorgeous brothers fly freely in
the beautiful world out of doors

illustration such a gorgeous coat




king of the birds


once upon a time when the world was very new and when the birds had
just learned from mother magpie how to build their nests some one said
we ought to have a king oh we need a king of the birds very much

for you see already in the garden of birds trouble had begun there
were disputes every morning as to which was the earliest bird who was
entitled to the worm there were quarrels over the best places for
nest-building and over the fattest bug or beetle and there was no one
to settle these difficulties moreover the robber birds were growing
too bold and there was no one to rule and punish them there was no
doubt about it the birds needed a king to keep them in order and peace

so the whisper went about we must have a king whom shall we choose
for our king

they decided to hold a great meeting for the election and because the
especial talent of a bird is for flying they agreed that the bird who
could fly highest up into the blue sky straight toward the sun should
be their king king of all the feathered tribes of the air

therefore after breakfast one beautiful morning the birds met in the
garden to choose their king all the birds were there from the largest
to the smallest chirping twittering singing on every bush and tree
and bit of dry grass till the noise was almost as great as nowadays at
an election of two-legged folk without feathers they swooped down in
great clouds till the sky was black with them and they were dotted on
the grass like punctuation marks on a green page there were so many
that not even wise mother magpie or old master owl could count them and
they all talked at the same time like ladies at an afternoon tea which
was very confusing

little robin redbreast was there hopping about and saying pleasant
things to every one for the was a great favorite gorgeous goldfinch was
there in fine feather and little blackbird who was then as white as
snow there were the proud peacock and the silly ostrich the awkward
penguin and the dodo whom no man living has ever seen likewise there
were the jubjub bird and the dinky bird and many other curious
varieties that one never finds described in the wise bird bookswhich
is very strange and sad too I think yes all the birds were there
for the choosing of their king both the birds who could fly and those
who could not but for what were they given wings if not to fly how
silly an ostrich must feel

now the eagle expected to be king the felt sure that the could fly higher
than any one else the sat apart on a tall pine tree looking very
dignified and noble as a future king should look and the birds glanced
at one another nodded their heads and whispered the is sure to be
elected king the can fly straight up toward the sun without winking and
his great wings are so strong so strong the never grows tired the is
sure to be king

thus they whispered among themselves and the eagle heard them and was
pleased but the little brown wren heard also and the was not pleased
the absurd little bird the wanted to be king himself although the was
one of the tiniest birds there who could never be a protector to the
others nor stop trouble when it began no indeed fancy him stepping
as a peacemaker between a robber hawk and a bloody falcon it was they
who would make pieces of him but the was a conceited little creature
and saw no reason why the should not make a noble sovereign

I am cleverer than the eagle the said to himself though the is so
much bigger I will be king in spite of him ha-ha we shall see what we
shall see for the wren had a great idea in his wee little headan
idea bigger than the head itself if you can explain how that could be
he ruffled up his feathers to make himself as huge as possible and
hopped over to the branch where the eagle was sitting

well eagle said the wren pompously I suppose you expect to be
king eh

the eagle stared hard at him with his great bright eyes well if I do
what of that the said who will dispute me

I shall said the wren bobbing his little brown head and wriggling
his tail saucily

you said the eagle do you expect to fly higher than i

yes chirped the wren I do yes I do do do

ho said the eagle scornfully I am big and strong and brave I can
fly higher than the clouds you poor little thing are no bigger than a
bean you will be out of breath before we have gone twice this trees
height

little as I am I can mount higher than you said the wren

what will you wager wren asked the eagle what will you give me if
I win

if you win you will be king said the wren but beside that if you
win I will give you my fat little body to eat for your breakfast but if
I win sir I shall be king and you must promise never never never
to hurt me or any of my people

very well I promise said the eagle haughtily come now it is time
for the trial you poor little foolish creature

the birds were flapping their wings and singing eagerly let us
beginbegin we want to see who is to be king come birds to the
trial who can fly the highest come

then the eagle spread his great wings and mounted leisurely into the
air straight toward the noonday sun and after him rose a number of
other birds who wanted to be kingthe wicked hawk the bold albatross
and the skylark singing his wonderful song the long-legged stork
started also but that was only for a joke fancy me for a king he
cried and the laughed so that the had to come down again in a minute but
the wren was nowhere to be seen the truth was the had hopped ever so
lightly upon the eagles head where the sat like a tiny crest but the
eagle did not know the was there

soon the hawk and the albatross and even the brave little skylark fell
behind and the eagle began to chuckle to himself at his easy victory
where are you poor little wren the cried very loudly for the fancied
that the tiny bird must be left far far below

here I am here I am away up above you master eagle piped the wren
in a weak little voice and the eagle fancied the wren was so far up in
the air that even his sharp eyes could not spy the tiny creature dear
me said the to himself how extraordinary that the has passed me so
he redoubled his speed and flew on higher higher

presently the called out again in a tremendous voice well where are
you now where are you now poor little wren

once more the heard the tiny shrill voice from somewhere above piping
here I am here I am nearer the sun than you master eagle will you
give up now

of course the eagle would not give up yet the flew on higher and
higher till the garden and its flock of patient birds waiting for their
king grew dim and blurry below and at last even the mighty wings of the
eagle were weary for the was far above the clouds surely the thought
now the wren is left miles behind the gave a scream of triumph and
cried where are you now poor little wren can you hear me at all
down below there

but what was his amazement to hear the same little voice above his head
shrilling here I am here I am sir eagle look up and see me look
and there sure enough the was fluttering above the eagles head and
now since I have mounted so much higher than you will you agree that i
have won

yes you have won little wren let us descend together for I am weary
enough cried the eagle much mortified and down the swooped on heavy
discouraged wings

yes let us descend together murmured the wren once more perching
comfortably on the eagles head and so down the rode on this convenient
elevator which was the first one invented in this world

when the eagle nearly reached the ground the other birds set up a cry
of greeting

hail king eagle they sang how high you flew how near the sun did
he not scorch your majestys feathers hail mighty king and they made
a deafening chorus but the eagle stopped them

the wren is your king not I the said the mounted higher than I did

the wren ha-ha the wren we cant believe that the wren flew
higher than you no no they all shouted but just then the eagle
lighted on a tree and from the top of his head hopped the little wren
cocking his head and ruffling himself proudly

yes I mounted higher than the he cried for I was perched on his
head all the while ha-ha and now therefore I am king small though i
be

now the eagle was very angry when the saw the trick that had been played
upon him and the swooped upon the sly wren to punish him but the wren
screamed remember remember your promise never to injure me or mine
then the eagle stopped for the was a noble bird and never forgot a
promise the folded his wings and turned away in disgust

be king then o cheat and trickster the said

cheat and trickster echoed the other birds we will have no such
fellow for our king cheat and trickster the is and the shall be
punished you shall be king brave eagle for without your strength he
could never have flown so high it is you whom we want for our
protector and lawmaker not this sly fellow no bigger than a bean

so the eagle became their king after all and a noble bird the is as
you must understand or the would never have been chosen to guard our
nations coat of arms and besides this you may see his picture on many
a banner and crest and coin of gold or silver so famous has the become

but the wren was to be punished and while the birds were trying to
decide what should be done with him they put him in prison in a
mouse-hole and set master owl to guard the door now while the judges
were putting their heads together the lazy owl fell fast asleep and out
of prison stole the little wren and was far away before any one could
catch him so the was never punished after all as the richly deserved to
be

the birds were so angry with old master owl for his carelessness that he
has never since dared to show his face abroad in daytime but hides away
in his hollow tree and only at night the wanders alone in the woods
sorry and ashamed




halcyone


the story of the first kingfisher is a sad one and you need not read it
unless for a very little while you wish to feel sorry

long long ago when the world was new there lived a beautiful princess
named halcyone she was the daughter of old Æolus king of the winds
and lived with him on his happy island where it was his chief business
to keep in order the four boisterous brothers boreas the north wind
zephyrus the west wind auster the south wind and eurus the east
wind sometimes indeed Æolus had a hard time of it for the winds
would escape from his control and rush out upon the sea for their
terrible games which were sure to bring death and destruction to the
sailors and their ships knowing them so well for she had grown up with
these rough playmates halcyone came to dread more than anything else
the cruelties which they practiced at every opportunity

one day the prince ceyx came to the island of king Æolus the was the son
of hesperus the evening star and the was the king of the great land of
thessaly ceyx and halcyone grew to love each other dearly and at last
with the consent of good king Æolus but to the wrath of the four winds
the beautiful princess went away to be the wife of ceyx and queen of
thessaly

for a long time they lived happily in their peaceful kingdom but
finally came a day when ceyx must take a long voyage on the sea to
visit a temple in a far country halcyone could not bear to have him go
for she feared the dangers of the great deep knowing well the cruelty
of the winds whom king Æolus had such difficulty in keeping within
bounds she knew how the mischievous brothers loved to rush down upon
venturesome sailors and blow them into danger and she knew that they
especially hated her husband because the had carried her away from the
island where she had watched the winds at their terrible play she
begged ceyx not to go but the said that it was necessary then she
prayed that if the must go the would take her with him for she could not
bear to remain behind dreading what might happen

but ceyx was resolved that halcyone should not go the good king longed
to take her with him no more than she could the smile at the thought of
separation but the also feared the sea not on his own account but for
his dear wife in spite of her entreaties the remained firm if all went
well the promised to return in two months time but halcyone knew that
she should never see him again as now the spoke

the day of separation came standing heart-broken upon the shore
halcyone watched the vessel sail away into the east until as a little
speck it dropped below the horizon then sobbing bitterly she returned
to the palace

now the king and his men had completed but half their journey when a
terrible storm arose the wicked winds had escaped from the control of
good old Æolus and were rushing down upon the ocean to punish ceyx for
carrying away the beautiful halcyone fiercely they blew the lightning
flashed and the sea ran high and in the midst of the horrible tumult
the good ship went to the bottom with all on board thus the fears of
halcyone were proved true and far from his dear wife poor ceyx perished
in the cruel waves

that very night when the shipwreck occurred the sad and fearful
halcyone sleeping lonely at home knew in a dream the very calamity
which had happened she seemed to see the storm and the shipwreck and
the form of ceyx appeared saying a sad farewell to her as soon as it
was light she rose and hastened to the seashore trembling with a
horrible dread standing on the very spot whence she had last seen the
fated ship she looked wistfully over the waste of stormy waters at
last she spied a dark something tossing on the waves the object floated
nearer and nearer until a huge breaker cast before her on the sand the
body of her drowned husband

o dearest ceyx she cried is it thus that you return to me
stretching out her arms toward him she leaped upon the sea wall as if
she would throw herself into the ocean which advanced and retreated
seething around his body but a different fate was to be hers as she
leaped forward two strong wings sprouted from her shoulders and before
she knew it she found herself skimming lightly as a bird over the water
from her throat came sounds of sobbing which changed as she flew into
the shrill piping of a bird soft feathers now covered her body and a
crest rose above the forehead which had once been so fair halcyone was
become a kingfisher the first kingfisher who ever flew lamenting above
the waters of the world

the sad bird fluttered through the spray straight to the body that was
tossed upon the surf as her wings touched the wet shoulders and as her
horny beak sought the dumb lips in an attempt to kiss what was once so
dear the body of ceyx began to receive new life the limbs stirred a
faint color returned to the cheeks at the same moment a change like
that which had transformed halcyone began to pass over her husband he
too was becoming a kingfisher the too felt the thrill of wings upon his
shoulders wings which were to bear him up and away out of the sea which
had been his death the too was clad in soft plumage with a kingly crest
upon his kingly head with a faint cry half of sorrow for what had
happened half of joy for the future in which these two loving ones were
at least to be together ceyx rose from the surf-swept sand where his
lifeless limbs had lain and went skimming over the waves beside halcyone
his wife

so those unhappy mortals became the first kingfishers happy at last in
being reunited so we see them still flying up and down over the waters
of the world royal forms with royal crests upon their heads

they built their nest of the bones of fish a stout and well-joined
basket which floated on the waves as safely as any little boat and
while their children the baby halcyons lay in this rocking cradle for
seven days in the heart of winter no storms ever troubled the ocean
and mariners could set out upon their voyages without fear

for while his little grandchildren rocked in their basket the good king
Æolus pitying the sorrows of his daughter halcyone was always
especially careful to chain up in prison those wicked brothers the
winds so that they could do no mischief of any kind

and that is why a halcyon time has come to mean a season of peace and
safety




the forgetful kingfisher


in these days the kingfisher is a sad and solitary bird caring not to
venture far from the water where she finds her food up and down the
river banks she goes uttering a peculiar plaintive cry what is she
saying and why is she so restless the american kingfisher is gray but
her cousin of europe is a bird of brilliant azure with a breast of rusty
red therefore it must have been the foreign kingfisher who was
forgetful as you shall hear

long long after the sorrows of halcyone the first kingfisher were
ended came the great storm which lasted forty days and forty nights
causing the worst flood which the world has ever known that was a
terrible time when father noah hastened to build his ark inviting the
animals and birds to take refuge with him the kingfisher herself was
glad to go aboard for even she protected by Æolus from the fury of
winds and waters was not safe while there was no place in all the world
for her to rest foot and weary wing so the kingfisher fluttered in with
the other birds and animals a strange company and there they lived
all together noah and his arkful of pets for many weary days while
the waters raged and the winds howled outside and all the earth was
covered fathoms deep out of sight below the waves

but after long weeks the storm ceased and father noah opened the little
window in the ark and sent forth the dove to see whether or not there
was land visible on which the ark might find rest now after the had sent
out the dove noah looked about him at the other birds and animals which
crowded around him eagerly for they were growing very restless from
their long confinement and the said which of you is bravest and will
dare follow our friend the dove out into the watery world ah here is
the kingfisher little mother you at least reared among the winds and
waters will not be afraid take wing o kingfisher and see if the
earth be visible then return quickly and bring me faithful word of what
you find out yonder

day was just beginning to dawn when the kingfisher who was then as gray
as gray flew out from the little window of the ark whence the dove had
preceded her but hardly had she left the safe shelter of father noahs
floating home when there came a tremendous whirlwind which blew her
about and buffeted her until she was almost beaten into the waves
which rolled endlessly over the face of the whole earth covering the
high hills and the very mountains the kingfisher was greatly
frightened she could not go back into the ark for the little window
was closed and there was no land anywhere on which she could take
refuge just think for a moment what a dreadful situation it was there
was nothing for her to do but to fly up straight up out of reach from
the tossing waves and dashing spray

the kingfisher was fresh and vigorous and her wings were strong and
powerful for she had been resting long days in the quiet ark eating
the provisions which father noah had thoughtfully prepared for his many
guests so up up she soared above the very clouds on into the blue
ether which lies beyond and lo as she did so her sober gray dress
became a brilliant blue the color caught from the azure of those clear
heights higher and higher she flew feeling so free and happy after her
long captivity that she quite forgot father noah and the errand upon
which she had been sent up and up she went higher than the sun until
at last she saw him rising far beneath her a beautiful ball of fire
more dazzling more wonderful than she had ever guessed

hola she cried beside herself with joy at the sight there is the
dear sun whom I have not seen for many days and how near how
beautiful the is I will fly closer still now that I have come so near
I will observe him in all his splendor as no other bird not even the
high-flying sharp-eyed eagle has ever seen him

and with that the foolish kingfisher turned her course downward with
such mad headlong speed that she had scarcely time to feel what
terrible increasing heat shot from the suns rays until she was so
close upon him that it was too late to escape oh but that was a
dreadful moment the feathers on her poor little breast were scorched
and set afire and she seemed in danger not only of spoiling her
beautiful new blue dress but of being burned into a wretched little
cinder horribly frightened at her danger the kingfisher turned once
more but this time toward the rolling waters which covered the earth
down down she swooped until with the hiss of burning feathers she
splashed into the cold wetness putting out the fire which threatened to
consume her once twice thrice she dipped into the grateful coolness
flirting the drops from her blue plumage now alas sadly scorched

when the pain of her burns was somewhat relieved she had time to think
what next she should do she longed for rest for refuge for father
noahs gentle caressing hand to which she had grown accustomed during
those stormy weeks of companionship in the ark but where was father
noah where was the ark on all the rolling sea of water there was no
movement of life no sign of any human presence then the kingfisher
remembered her errand and how carelessly she had performed it she had
been bidden to return quickly but she had wasted many hoursshe could
not tell how manyin her forgetful flight and now she was to be
punished indeed if she could not find her master and the ark of refuge

the poor kingfisher looked wildly about she fluttered here and there
backward and forward over the weary stretch of waves crying piteously
for her master the did not answer there was no ark to be found the sun
set and the night came on but still she sought eagerly from east to
west from north to south always in vain she could never find what she
had so carelessly lost

the truth is that during her absence the dove who had done her errand
faithfully returned at last with the olive leaf which told of one spot
upon the earths surface at last uncovered by the waves then the ark
blown hither and thither by the same storm which had driven the
kingfisher to fly upward into the ether-blue had drifted far and far
to mount ararat where it ran aground and father noah disembarking
with his family and all the assembled animals had broken up the ark
intending there to build him a house out of the materials from which it
was made but this was many many leagues from the place where the poor
kingfisher lonely and frightened hovered about crying piteously for
her master

and even when the waters dried away uncovering the earth in many
places so that the kingfisher could alight and build herself a nest
she was never happy nor content but to this day flies up and down the
water-ways of the world piping sadly looking eagerly for her dear
master and for some traces of the ark which sheltered her and the
reflection which she makes in the water below shows an azure-blue body
like a reflection of the sky above with some of the breast-feathers
scorched to a rusty red and now you know how it all came about




the wren who brought fire


centuries and centuries ago when men were first made there was no such
thing as fire known in all the world folk had no fire with which to
cook their food and so they were obliged to eat it raw which was very
unpleasant as you may imagine there were no cheery fireplaces about
which to sit and tell stories or make candy or pop corn there was no
light in the darkness at night except the sun and moon and stars there
were not even candles in those days to say nothing of gas lamps or
electric lights it is strange to think of such a world where even the
grown folks like the children and the birds had to go to bed at dusk
because there was nothing else to do

but the little birds who lived nearer heaven than men knew of the fire
in the sun and knew also what a fine thing it would be for the tribes
without feathers if they could have some of the magic element

one day the birds held a solemn meeting when it was decided that men
must have fire then some one must fly up to the sun and bring a
firebrand thence who would undertake this dangerous errand already by
sad experience the kingfisher had felt the force of the suns heat
while the eagle and the wren in the famous flight which they had taken
together had learned the same thing the assembly of birds looked at
one another and there was a silence

I dare not go said the kingfisher trembling at the idea I have
been up there once and the warning I received was enough to last me for
some time

I cannot go said the peacock for my plumage is too precious to
risk

I ought not to go said the lark for the heat might injure my pretty
voice

I must not go said the stork for I have promised to bring a baby to
the kings palace this evening

I cannot go said the dove for I have a nestful of little ones who
depend upon me for food

nor I said the sparrow for I am afraid nor I nor I nor i
echoed the other birds

I will not go croaked the owl for I simply do not wish to

then up spoke the little wren who had been keeping in the background
of late because the was despised for his attempt to deceive the birds
into electing him their king

I will go said the wren I will go and bring fire to men I am of
little use here no one loves me every one despises me because of the
trick which I played the eagle our king no one will care if I am
injured in the attempt I will go and try

bravely spoken little friend said the eagle kindly I myself would
go but that I am the king and kings must not risk the lives upon which
hangs the welfare of their people go you little wren and if you are
successful you will win back the respect of your brothers which you have
forfeited

the brave little bird set out upon his errand without further words and
weak and delicate though the was the flew and the flew up and up so
sturdily that at last the reached the sun whence the plucked a firebrand
and bore it swiftly in his beak back toward the earth like a falling
star the bright speck flashed through the air drawing ever nearer and
nearer to the cool waters of birdland and the safety which awaited him
there the other birds gathered in a flock about their king and
anxiously watched the wrens approach

suddenly the robin cried out alas the burns the has caught fire and
off darted the faithful little friend to help the wren sure enough a
spark from the blazing brand had fallen upon the plumage of the wren
and his poor little wings were burning as the fluttered piteously down
still holding the fire in his beak

the robin flew up to him and said well done brother you have
succeeded now give me the fire and I will relieve you while you drop
into the lake below us to quench the flame which threatens your life

so the robin in his turn seized the firebrand in his beak and started
down with it but like the wren the too was soon fluttering in the
blaze of his own burning plumage a little living firework falling
toward the earth

then up came the lark who had been watching the two unselfish birds
give me the brand brother robin she cried for your pretty feathers
are all ablaze and your life is in danger

so it was the lark who finally brought the fire safely to the earth and
gave it to mankind but the robin and the wren when they had put out
the flame which burned their feathers appeared in the assembly of the
birds and were greeted with great applause as the heroes of the day
the robins breast was scorched a brilliant red but the poor brave
little wren was wholly bare of plumage all his pretty feathers had been
burned away and the stood before them shivering and piteous

bravo little wren cried king eagle a noble deed you have done this
day and nobly have you won back the respect of your brother birds and
earned the everlasting gratitude of men now what shall we do to help
you in your sorry plight after a moments thought the turned to the
other birds and said who will give a feather to help patch a covering
for our brave friend

I and I and I and I chorused the generous birds and in turn
each came forward with a plume or a bit of down from his breast the
robin first who had shared his peril brought a feather sadly scorched
but precious the lark next who had helped in the time of need the
eagle bestowed a kingly feather the thrush the nightingaleevery
bird contributed except the owl

but the selfish owl said I see no reason why I should give a feather
hoot no the wren brought me into trouble once and I will not help him
now let him go bare for all my aid

shame shame cried the birds indignantly old master owl you ought
to be ashamed but if you are so selfish we will not have you in our
society go back to your hollow tree

yes go back to your hollow tree cried the eagle sternly and when
winter comes may you shiver with cold as you would have left the brave
little wren to shiver this day you shall ruffle your feathers as much
as you like but you will always feel cold at heart because your heart
is selfish

and indeed since that day for all his feathers the owl has never been
able to keep warm enough in his lonely hollow tree

but the wren became one of the happiest of all the birds and a favorite
both with his feathered brothers and with men because of his brave
deed and because of the great fire-gift which the had brought from the
sun




how the bluebird crossed


of course every one knows that the bluebird was made from a piece of the
azure sky itself one has only to match his wonderful color against the
april heaven to be sure of that therefore the little bluebird was
especially dear to the spirit of the sky the father in heaven

one day this venturesome little bird started out upon a long journey
across the wide pacific ocean toward this new world which neither
columbus nor any other man had yet discovered under him tossed the
wide wide sea rolling for miles in every direction with no land
visible anywhere on which a little bird might rest his foot for this
was also before there were any islands in all that stretch of waters
soon the poor little bluebird became very weary and wished the had not
ventured upon so long a flight his wings began to droop and the sank
lower and lower toward the sea which seemed eager to overwhelm his
blueness with its own the had come so far over the salty wastes that he
was very thirsty but with water water everywhere there was not a drop
to drink the poor little bird glanced despairingly up toward the blue
sky from which the had been made and cried

o spirit of the blue sky o my father in heaven help your child the
bluebird give me I pray you a place to rest and refreshment for my
thirsty throat or I perish in the cruel blue waters

at these sorrowful words the kind father took pity upon his little
bluebird and what do you think the made a baby earthquake which heaved
a rocky point of land up through the waves just big enough for a little
birds perch it was a tiny reef and a crack in the rock held but a few
drops of the rain which began to fall but it meant at least a moments
safety and draught of life for the weary bird and glad enough the was to
reach it

he had not been there long however when a big wave almost washed him
away the was not yet safe still the lacked the rest and refreshment
which the so sorely needed for the raindrops were soon turned brackish
by the waves which dashed upon the reef from all sides and the bluebird
had to keep hopping up and down to avoid being drowned in the tossing
spray the was more tired than ever and this continuous exercise made
him even more thirsty once more the prayed to the father for help and
once more the kind spirit of the sky heard him from the blueness

this time there was a terrible earthquake until the sea boiled and
rolled into huge waves as if churned by a mighty churn at the very
bottom of things and with a terrified scream the bluebird flew high
into the air

but when the noise and the rumbling died away and once more the sea lay
calm and still what do you think the bluebird saw the great ocean
which had once stretched an unbroken sheet of blue as far as the eye
could see was now dotted here and there by islands big islands and
little islands groups and archipelagoes of them just as on the map one
sees them to-day peppering the pacific ocean samoa came up and tonga
and tulima and many others with names quite as bad if not worse from
one island to another the bluebird flew finding rest and refreshment on
each until the reached the mainland in safety and there the islands
remain to this day for other travelers to visit breaking their journey
from west to east or from east to west there are forests and cascades
springs of fresh and pleasant water delicious fruits wonderful birds
and animals and finally a race of strange dark men but they came
long long after

so the bluebird crossed the pacific folk tell was it not wonderful how
the kind father came to scatter those many islands in the pacific
oceanstepping-stones for a tiny little bluebird so that the need not
wet his feet in crossing that wide salty river




the peacocks cousin


long long ago in the days of wise king solomon the crow and the
pheasant were the best of friends and were always seen going about
together wing in wing now the pheasant was the peacocks own
cousina great honor many thought for the peacock was the most
gorgeous of all the birds but it was not altogether pleasant for the
pheasant because at that time the wore such plain and shabby old
garments that his proud relative was ashamed of him and did not like to
be reminded that they were of the same family when the peacock went
strutting about with his wonderful tail spread fan-wise and with his
vain little eyes peering to see who might be admiring his beauty the
peacocks cousin and his friend the crow who was then a plain white
bird would slink aside and hide behind a tree whence they would peep
enviously until the peacock had passed by then the peacocks cousin
would say

oh how beautiful how grand how noble the is how came such a lordly
bird to have for a cousin so homely a creature as i

but the crow would answer trying to comfort his friend yes the is
gorgeous but listen what a harsh and disagreeable voice the has and
see how vain the is I would not be so vain had I so scandalous a tale in
my family history

then the crow told the peacocks cousin how his proud relative came to
have so unmusical a voice

                                   

when adam and eve were living peacefully in their fair garden while
satan was still seeking in vain a way to enter there the peacock was
the most beautiful of all the companions who surrounded the happy pair
his plumage shone like pearl and emerald and his voice was so melodious
that the was selected to sing the lords praises every day in the streets
of heaven but the was then as now very very vain and satan prowling
about outside the wall of paradise saw this

aha the said to himself here is the vainest creature in all the
world the is the one I must flatter in order to win entrance to the
garden where I am to work my mischief let me approach the peacock

satan stole softly to the gate and in a wheedling voice called to the
peacock

o most wonderful and beautiful bird are you one of the birds of
paradise

yes I am one of the dwellers in the happy garden answered the
peacock strutting but who are you who slink about so secretly as if
afraid of some one

I am one of the cherubim who are appointed to sing the lords praises
answered the wicked satan I have stopped for a moment to visit the
paradise which the has prepared for the blest and I find as my first
glimpse of its glories you o most lovely bird will you conceal me
under your rainbow wings and bring me within the walls

I dare not answered the peacock the lord allows none to enter here
he will be angry and will punish me

o charming bird went on satan with his smooth tongue take me with
you and I will teach you three mysterious words which shall preserve
you forever from sickness age and death

at this promise the peacock was greatly tempted and began to hesitate in
his refusals and at last the said

I dare not myself let you in o stranger but if you keep your promise
I will send the serpent who is wiser than I and who may more easily
find some way to let you enter unobserved

so it was through the peacock that satan met the vile serpent whose
shape the assumed in order to enter the garden and tempt eve with the
apple and for the peacocks share in the doings of that dreadful day
the lord took away his beautiful voice and sent him forth from the
pleasant garden to chatter harshly in this workaday world where his
gorgeousness and his vanity are but a reminder to men of the shame which
he brought upon their ancestors

                                   

and therefore said the crow concluding his gossip therefore dear
pheasant I see no reason why we should envy your cousin we are very
plain citizens of birdland but we are at least respectable I like you
much better having nothing to make you vain nothing of which to be
ashamed

                                   

so the crow spoke in the wisdom which the had learned from solomon but
the peacocks cousin refused to be comforted the shabbiness of his coat
preyed upon his mind and the fancied that the other birds jeered at him
because in such old clothes the dared to be the peacocks cousin it
seemed to him that every day the peacock himself grew more haughty and
more patronizing

one day the crow and the peacocks cousin were sauntering through the
malay woods when they met the peacock face to face the crow looked
defiant and stood jauntily but the pheasant tried to shrink out of
sight the peacock however had spied his poor relative and was filled
with cousinly resentment at his appearance

he stopped short the stood upon one leg the puffed and ruffled himself
spreading out his thousand-eyed tail so that its colors flashed
wonderfully in the sunshine the frilled his neck feathers and snapped
his mean little eyes maliciously then turning his back on the shabby
couple said as the stepped airily away

ah I have dropped some of my old feathers back there a little way you
can have them if you like pheasant they will freshen you up a bit you
really are looking shockingly seedy but for mercys sake dont wear
them in my presence I cant bear to see any one parading in my cast-off
elegance then the peacock minced away

the peacocks cousin stamped on the ground and flapped his wings with
rage if the had been a girl the would have burst into tears I cannot
stand this the cried to be treated as if I were a beggar to be given
old clothes to wear crow crow if you were any kind of friend you
would help me but you stand staring there and see me insulted without
turning a feather what is the use of all your wisdom that you learned
from king solomon if you cannot help a friend in need I tell you i
must have some better garments or I shall die of mortification

dont be excited said the crow soothingly I have been thinking the
matter over and I believe I can do something listen yesterday I found
brushes and a box of colors in a room of the kings palace they
belonged to the court painter now they belong to me for I have hidden
them away in a hollow tree where no one else can find them I thought
they might be useful and I think so still

well well what do you propose to do with paints and brushes cried
the peacocks cousin impatiently

I propose to paint you to varnish you to gild you patiently
answered the crow

oh you dear crow exclaimed the other clapping his wings you will
make me brilliant and beautiful you will make me worthy of the
peacock will you not how clever of you to think of such a thing

yes replied the crow I watched the court painter at work in the
garden one day and I know how it is done I will make you as gorgeous
as you wish but you must return the compliment if you are to be an
ornament of fashion so must I be for are we not inseparable cronies
and when you become beautiful it would not do for you to be seen with
such a dowdy as I am

you dear creature said the peacocks cousin affectionately of
course we will share alike I will paint you as soon as I see how you
succeed with me ah I know your skill in everything you will be a fine
artist my friend but come let us get to work at once

so the flattered crow led him to the hollow tree where the had concealed
the brushes and the gilding and the india ink and all the gorgeous
changeable tints which an eastern artist uses in his paintings here we
are said the crow now let us see what we shall see when master crow
turns painter

the crow set to work with a will splashing on the colors generously
gold and green and bronze iridescence the had the peacock in mind and
though the did not exactly copy the plumage of that wonderful bird he
managed to suggest the cousinship of the pheasant in the golden eyes of
his long and beautiful tail when the had finished the crow was
delighted with his work

ah the cried now bend over this fountain my dear friend and
observe yourself I think you do credit to my skill as an artist eh

the peacocks cousin hurried down to the water-pool all in a flutter of
excitement and when the saw his image the cried how beautiful how
truly beautiful I am why I am quite as handsome as peacock himself
surely now the need not be ashamed to call me cousin I shall move in
the most fashionable circles heavens look at my lovely tail look at
my burnished feathers I must go immediately and show my new dress to
cousin peacock I should not be surprised if the became jealous of my
gorgeousness and off the started as fast as the could go

hold on cried the crow dont run away so quickly you have
forgotten something dont you remember that you promised to paint me
beautiful like yourself

oh bother answered the ungrateful friend tossing his head I have
no time now for such business I must hasten to my cousin for this is a
matter of family pride run along like a good creature and by the way
you may as well gather the feathers which peacock mentioned I am sure
they will make you look quite respectable besides I will give you some
of mine when I have worn them a little ta-ta and the stepped airily
away

but the crow strode after him shaking his wings and crying come back
come back and perform your part of the bargain you selfish ungrateful
creature and the caught the pheasant by one of his long tail-feathers

let go my train impertinent wretch shrieked the peacocks cousin
turning upon him fiercely I tell you I have no time to spend in such
nonsense I must be presenting myself in high society

villain croaked the crow and the rushed forward fiercely intending
to tear out the beautiful feathers which the had painted for his
ungrateful friend thereupon the pheasant exclaimed

you want to be painted do you well take that and seizing the
bottle of india ink which was in the eastern artists paint-box he
hurled it at the poor crow deluging with blackness his spotless
feathers then laughing harshly away the flew to his cousin the peacock
who received him with proud affection because they were now really
birds of a feather for the peacocks cousin was become one of the most
beautiful birds in the world

but the poor crow was now a sombre black bird wearing the
seedy-looking inky coat which we know so well to-day his heart was
broken by his friends faithlessness and the became a sour cynic who can
see no good in anything the flies about crying caw caw in the most
disagreeable sarcastic tone as if sneering at the mean action of that
malay bird which the can never forget




the masquerading crow


the crow became very sour and disagreeable after his friend the
peacocks cousin deserted him for more gorgeous company though he
pretended not to care because the pheasant was now a proud
beautifully-coated dandy while the was the shabbiest of all the birds in
his coat of rusty black yet in truth the did care very much the could
not forget how the peacocks cousin had dyed him this sombre hue after
promising to paint him bright and wonderful like himself the could not
help thinking how fine the would have looked in similar plumage of a
rainbow tint or how becoming a long swallow-tail would be to his style
of beauty the wished that there was a tailor in birdland to whom he
could go for a new suit of clothes but alas there seemed no way but
for him to remain ugly old crow to the end of the chapter

the crow went moping about most unhappily while this was preying on his
mind until the really became somewhat crazy upon the subject the only
thing about which the could think was clothesclothesclothes and
that is indeed a foolish matter to absorb ones mind one word of the
peacocks cousin remained in his memory and refused to be forgotten he
had advised the crow to gather up the feathers which had fallen from the
peacocks plumage and to make himself fine with them first the crow
remembered these words sadly because they showed the unkind heart of
his old friend next the remembered them with scorn because they showed
vanity then the remembered them with interest because they gave him an
idea and that idea gradually grew bigger and bigger until it became a
plan

the plan came to him completely one day while the was sitting moodily on
a tree watching the peacock and his cousin sweeping proudly over the
velvet lawn of the kings garden for nowadays the pheasant moved in the
most courtly circles as the had promised himself as they passed under
the crow two beautiful feathers fell behind them and lay on the grass
shining in the sunlight with a hundred colors

once more the cast-off plumage of the peacock family is left for me
croaked the crow to himself am I only to be made beautiful by
borrowing from others perhaps I might collect feathers enough from all
the birds to conceal my inky coat aha I have it and this was the
plan of the crow the would steal from every dweller in birdland a
feather and see whether the could not make himself more beautiful than
the peacocks cousin himself

now the crow was a skilful thief the could steal the silver off the
kings table from under the stewards very nose the could steal a maids
thimble from her finger as she nodded sleepily over her work the could
steal the pen from behind a scribes ear as the paused to scratch his
head and think over the spelling of a word so the crow felt sure that
he could steal their feathers from the birds without any trouble

when the peacock and his cousin had passed by the crow swooped down and
carried off the two feathers which were to begin his collection the hid
them in his treasure-house in the hollow tree and started out for more

it was great fun for the crow and the almost forgot to be miserable he
followed old lady ostrich about for some time before the dared tweak a
handful of feathers from her tail but finally the succeeded and though
she squawked horribly and turned quick as a flash she was not quick
enough to catch the nimble thief who was already hidden under a bush
in the same way the secured some lovely plumes from the bird of
paradise the parrot and the cock the robbed the redbreast of his ruddy
vest the hoopoe of his crown and the secured a swallow-tail which he
had long coveted the took some rosy-redness from the flamingo the
gilding of the goldfinch the gray down of an eider-duck the burgled the
bluebird and the redbird and the yellowbird and not one single
feathered creature escaped his clever beak at last his hole in the tree
was brimming with feathers of every color length and degree of
softness a gorgeous feather-bed on which it would dazzle one to sleep

then the crow set to work to make himself a coat of many colors like
josephs the was a very clever bird and a wondrous coat it turned out
to be it had no particular cut nor style it was not like the coat
which any bird had ever before worn the feathers were placed in any
fashion that happened to please his original fancy some pointed up and
some down some were straight and some were curled some drooped about
his feet and others curved gracefully over his head some trailed far
behind the was completely covered from top to toe so that not one blot
of his own inky feathers showed through the gorgeousness a red vest he
wore and a swallow-tail of course and there was a crown of feathers
on his head never was there seen a more extraordinary bird nor one more
gaudy perhaps the was not in the best of taste but at least the was
striking

when all was finished the crow went and looked at himself in the
fountain mirror and the was much pleased

well now the cried how am I for a bird I believe no one will know
me and that is just as well for now I am so fine that I shall myself
refuse to know any one ho this ought to give some ideas to that
conceited peacock family I am a self-made man I am an artist who knows
how to adapt his materials I am a genius king solomon himself will
wonder at my glory and as for the eagle king of the birds the will
grow pale with envy king of the birds indeed it is now I who should
rightfully be king no other ever wore clothes so fine as mine by right
of them I ought to be king of the birds I will be king of the birds

you see the poor old crow was quite crazy with his one idea

forth the stalked into birdland to show his gorgeous plumage and to get
himself elected king of the birds the first persons the met were the
peacock and his cousinhe who was once the crows best friend the
crow ruffled himself his prettiest when the saw them coming

good gracious who is that extraordinary fowl drawled the peacock
he must be some great noble from a far country

how beautiful murmured his silly cousin how odd how fascinating
how distinguished I wish the crow had painted me like that the crow
heard these words and swelled with pride casting a scornful glance at
his old friend as the swept by

next the met a little sparrow who was picking bugs from the grass out
of my way birdling cried the crow haughtily I am the king

the king gasped the sparrow nearly choking over a fat bug the was so
surprised I did not know that the king wore such a robe how
gorgeousbut how queer

next the crow met mr stork standing gravely on one leg and thinking of
the little baby which the was going to bring that night to the cottage by
the lake the stork looked up in surprise as the wonderful stranger
approached

bless me the exclaimed whom have we here I thought I knew all
birdland but I never before saw such a freak as this

illustration bless me the exclaimed whom have we here

I am the king I am to be the new king announced the crow is
there any bird more gorgeous than i

truly I hope not said the stork gravely yet the woodcock is a very
foolish bird one never knows what the will do next if the should try to
be fashionable

but the crow had passed on without listening to the storks sarcasm

as the went through birdland the drew behind him a following of feathered
citizens chattering screaming tittering all together like the crowd
after a circus procession all the birds big and little plain and
pretty flocked to see this wonderful stranger who because of his fine
clothes was coming to have himself named king some of them thought him
truly beautiful some thought him ridiculous some envied him some
jeered but they all stared and the more they stared the more conceited
became the crow the more sure that the kingdom was to be his

at last they came into the presence of the eagle himself that royal
bird was perched upon his eyrie far up on the cliff below him gathered
the dense flock of birds waiting to see what would happen when the crow
demanded to be made king in the eagles place the eagle had been warned
of the matter by the little humming-bird and was looking very majestic
and scornful but the swallow flew round and round in great circles
twittering excitedly and in each circle sweeping nearer and nearer to
the ground the swallow was angry because some one had stolen his
beautiful swallow-tail

presently the crow swaggered forth and cocking his impertinent eye
towards the eagle the croaked

hello there old high-perch give me your crown and sceptre for I am
king of the birds not you look at my gorgeous clothes look at your
own dull plumage am I not kinglylook at me

the king made no reply merely gazing sternly at the crow but the
swallow took up the word

look at him look at him indeed o king the screamed there is
something strange about his kingly plumage that swallow-tail is mine i
know it and with a vicious tweak the swallow pulled out the long
forked feathers of which the crow was especially proud oh what a
shriek of rage the mad old bird gave at that moment the hoopoe came up
and said ha methinks I too recognize my property this is my crown
and forthwith the snatched the plumes from the crows forehead leaving
it quite ugly and bare next the gentle redbreast claimed his vest and
the bluebird her azure feathers and the ostrich her train which she had
sorely missed each of the birds in turn came up and with much
chattering and scolding twitched away the property of which the or she
had been robbed until the crow stood before them in his customary suit
of solemn black a bird ashamed and sore for they had pecked him with
their bills and beaten him with their wings and scratched him with their
claws until even his own plain old coat was frayed and rent

oh ho oh ho it is only old daddy crow after all screamed the birds
in chorus and then because the eagle burst out laughing they saw that
it was really funny since the king did not mind being robbed for a time
of his title surely they need not mourn over the few feathers which the
thief had borrowed especially since each now had his own chattering
with glee they all flew home to their various nests leaving the crow
alone with his shame and soreness

just at this moment the peacock and his cousin came hurrying up out of
breath

oh what is it what is the matter what was all that noise just now
asked the peacock

oh what has become of the beautiful noble splendid remarkable
graceful gorgeous stylish long-tailed kingly stranger questioned
the peacocks cousin speaking affably to the crow for the first time
since his adoption into high society

the crow looked at him sideways and all his madness went away as the saw
how very very silly this creature was

he was a fool in fools feathers the croaked the is no more but
before the end the bade me return these to you saying fine feathers do
not make fine birds speaking thus the presented to the pair their two
long feathers with which the had started his collection and which were
the only ones now remaining to the masquerading crow

then with a harsh caw the flew away to his tree the is not a happy
bird but since that time the has never been so mad as to think that
clothes are the chief thing in the world




king solomon and the birds


king solomon was wiser than all men and his fame was in all nations
round about jerusalem the was so wise that the knew every spoken
language yes but more than this the could talk with everything that
lived trees and flowers beasts and fowls creeping things and fishes
what a very pleasant thing that was for solomon to be sure and how
glad one would be nowadays to have such knowledge

solomon was especially fond of birds and loved to talk with them
because their voices were so sweet and they spoke such beautiful words
one day the wise king was chatting pleasantly with the birds who lived
in his wonderful garden and these are some of the things which the heard
them say the nightingale the sweetest singer of all chanted

contentment is the greatest happiness

it would be better for most people never to have been born crooned
the melancholy turtle-dove

the happy little swallow gave her opiniondo good and you will be
rewarded hereafter

the harsh cry of the peacock meant as thou judgest so shalt thou be
judged

the hoopoe said the who has no pity for others will find none for
himself

the cynical old crow croaked disagreeably the further away from men i
am the better I am pleased

last of all the cock who sings in the morning chanted his joyous
songthink of your creator o foolish creatures

when they had finished talking king solomon softly stroked the head of
the pretty little dove and bade her cheer up for life was not so
dreadful a thing after all and the gave her permission to build her
nest under the walls of the great temple which the was building the most
beautiful golden house in the whole world some years afterward the
doves had so increased in numbers that with their extended wings they
formed a veil over the numberless pilgrims who came to jerusalem to
visit the wonderful temple

but of all the winged singers who spoke that day in the garden the wise
king chose to have ever near him the cock because the had spoken words
of piety and the nimble hoopoe because the was able to plunge his
clear gaze into the depths of the earth as if it were made of
transparent glass and discover the places where springs of living water
were hidden under the soil it was very convenient for solomon when he
was traveling to have some one with him who was able to find water in
whatsoever place the might be resting

thus the cock and the hoopoe became solomons closest companions but of
the two the hoopoe was his favorite the hoopoe is an eastern bird and
we do not see him in america the is about as big as a jay colored a
beautiful reddish gray with feathers of purple brown and white and
his black wings are banded with white but the peculiar thing about a
hoopoe is his crown of tawny feathers a tall crown for so small a bird
and this is the story of the hoopoes crown

                                   

one day when solomon was journeying across the desert the was sorely
distressed by the heat of the sun until the came near to fainting just
then the spied a flock of his friends the hoopoes flying past and
calling to them feebly the begged them to shelter him from the burning
rays

the king of the hoopoes gathered together his whole nation and caused
them to fly in a thick cloud over the head of solomon while he
continued his journey in gratitude the wise king offered to give his
feathered friends whatever reward they might ask

for a whole day the hoopoes talked the matter over among themselves
then their king came to solomon and said to him

we have considered your offer o generous king and we have decided
that what we most desire is to have each of us a golden crown on his
head

king solomon smiled and answered crowns of gold shall you have but
you are foolish birds my hoopoes and when the evil days shall come
upon you and you see the folly of your desire return here to me and i
will help you yet again

so the king of the hoopoes left king solomon with a beautiful golden
crown upon his head and soon all the hoopoes were wearing golden
crowns thereupon they grew very proud and haughty they went down by
the lakes and pools and strutted there that they might admire themselves
in the water mirrors and the queen of the hoopoes became very airy and
refused to speak to her own cousin and to the other birds who had once
been her friends

there was a certain fowler who used to set traps for birds the put a
piece of broken mirror into his trap and a hoopoe spying it went in to
admire herself and was caught the fowler looked at the shining crown
upon her head and said what have we here I never saw a crown like
this upon any bird I must ask about this

so the took the crown to issachar the worker in metal and asked him
what it was issachar examined it carefully and his eyes stuck out of
his head but the said carelessly it is a crown of brass my friend i
will give you a quarter of a shekel for it and if you find any more
bring them to me but be sure to tell no other man of the matter a
shekel was about sixty-two cents

after this the fowler caught many hoopoes in the same way and sold
their crowns to issachar but one day as the was on his way to the
metalworkers shop the met a jeweler and to him the showed one of the
hoopoes crowns

what is this and where did you find it exclaimed the jeweler it is
pure gold I will give you a golden talent for every four you bring me
a talent was worth three hundred shekels

now when the value of the hoopoes crowns was known every one turned
fowler and began to hunt the precious birds in all the land of israel
was heard the twang of bows and the whirling of slings bird lime was
made in every town and the price of traps rose in the market so that
the trap-makers became rich men not a hoopoe could show his unlucky
head without being slain or taken captive and the days of the hoopoes
were numbered it seemed that soon there would be no more hoopoes left
to bewail their sad fate

at last the few who still lived gathered together and held a meeting to
consider what should be done for their minds were filled with sorrow
and dismay and they decided to appeal once more to king solomon who
had granted their foolish prayer

flying by stealth through the loneliest ways the unhappy king of the
hoopoes came at last to the court of the king and stood once more
before the steps of his golden throne with tears and groans the related
the sad fortune which had befallen his golden-crowned race

king solomon looked kindly upon the king of the hoopoes and said
behold did I not warn you of your folly in desiring to have crowns of
gold vanity and pride have been your ruin but now that there may be a
memorial of the service which once you did me your crowns of gold shall
be changed into crowns of feathers and with them you may walk unharmed
upon the earth

in this way the remaining hoopoes were saved for when the fowlers saw
that they no longer wore crowns of gold upon their heads they ceased to
hunt them as they had been doing and from that time forth the family of
the hoopoes have flourished and increased in peace even to the present
day

                                   

solomon was ever seeking to grow even wiser the better to know the
wonders of gods world and the ways of all creatures the undertook many
journeysnot as we ordinary poor mortals travel in heavy wagons or
clumsy boats by dusty roads or stormy waves it was in no such
troublous ways that solomon the all-powerful traversed space and reached
the uttermost corners of the earth thanks to his great knowledge he
had discovered a means of locomotion compared to which the most
magnificent railway coaches and the richest palanquins of indian princes
would seem poor indeed the had caused his geniI to make a silken carpet
of four leagues in extent in the midst of this carpet was placed a
magnificent throne for the royal traveler himself and around it were
seats of gold of silver of wood for the multitude of persons of
different rank whom the took with him there was also no lack of the most
gorgeous furniture and the necessary provisions for a kings traveling
banquet

when all was ready solomon was wont to seat himself upon his throne and
would command the winds to do their duty immediately they gently lifted
the carpet and bore it rapidly through the air to the appointed spot
during the journey above the aerial caravan fluttered a cloud of birds
who with their wings formed a splendid canopy to shield their beloved
lord from the suns heat as the hoopoes had first done

one day while on such a journey solomon was shocked to feel a ray of
sunlight piercing through this plumy dais which overhung his head
shading his eyes the king glanced up and perceived that there was an
opening in the canopy one bird was missing from its post in great
displeasure solomon demanded of the eagle the name of the truant
anxiously the eagle called the roll of all the birds in his company and
he was horrified to find that it was solomons favorite the hoopoe who
was missing with terror the announced the birds desertion to the most
wise king

soar aloft commanded solomon sternly and find the hoopoe that I may
punish him I will pluck off his feathers that the may feel the
scorching heat of the sun as his carelessness has caused me to do

the eagle soared heavenward until the earth beneath him looked like a
bowl turned upside down then the poised on level wings and looked around
in every direction to discover the truant soon the espied the hoopoe
flying swiftly from the south the eagle swooped down and would have
seized the culprit roughly in his strong talons but the hoopoe begged
him for solomons sake to be gentle

for solomons sake cried the eagle do you dare to name the king
whom you have injured the has discovered your absence and in his
righteous anger will punish you severely

lead me to him replied the hoopoe I know that the will forgive me
when the hears where I have been and what I have to tell him

the eagle led him to the king who with a wrathful face was sitting on
his throne the hoopoe trembled and drooped his feathers humbly but
when solomon would have crushed him in his mighty fist the bird cried

remember king that one day you also must give an account of your
sins let me not therefore be condemned unheard

and if I hear you what excuse can you have to offer answered
solomon frowning but this was his favorite bird and the hoped that
there might be some reason for sparing him

well said the hoopoe at mecca I met a hoopoe of my acquaintance who
told me so wonderful a tale of the marvelous kingdom of sheba in arabia
that I could not resist the temptation to visit that country of gold and
precious stones and there indeed I saw the most prodigious treasures
but best of all o king more glorious than gold more precious than
rare jewels I saw queen balkis the most beautiful of queens

tell me of this queen said solomon loosening his rough grasp upon
the hoopoe so it was say the mussulmans that a bird told solomon of
the great queen whose journey to jerusalem is described in the bible

the hoopoe told of her power and glory her riches her wisdom and her
beauty until solomon sighed a great sigh and said it seems too good
to be true but we shall see

so the king wrote a letter to balkis bidding her follow the guidance of
fate and come to the court of the wise king this note the sealed with
musk stamped with his great signet and gave to the hoopoe saying

if now you have spoken truth take this letter to queen balkis then
come away

the hoopoe did as the was bid darting off towards the south like an
arrow and the next day the came to the palace of the queen of sheba
where she sat in all her splendor among her counselors the hopped into
the hall and dropped the letter into her lap then flew away

queen balkis stared and stared at the great kings seal upon the
mysterious letter and when she had read the brief invitation she stared
and stared again but she had heard the fame of solomon and was eager to
ask him some of her clever questions to prove his wisdom so she decided
to accept his invitation and come to jerusalem

she came with a great train of attendants with camels that bore spices
and treasures of gold and precious stones gifts for the most wise king
and she asked him more questions than any woman had ever asked him
before though the knew a great many ladies and they were all
inquisitive

but solomon was so wise that the answered all her questions without any
trouble

and she said to him it was a true report that I heard of you in my own
land of your wisdom and of your glory only that which now I know and
see is greater than what I heard happy are thy men and happy are thy
servants who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom

and she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold which was a
very rich treasure besides great store of spices and the most precious
gifts no one had ever seen such gifts as the queen of sheba gave to
solomon

but the in turn was even more generous for the gave to the fair balkis
all that she desired and everything she asked because the admired so
much this splendid queen of whom the hoopoe had first told him

and so the bible says the queen of sheba turned and went to her own
country she and her servants but the mussulmans tales say that in
later days she married solomon and they lived happily ever after and it
was all the work of that little hoopoe with a yellow crown whom after
that we may be sure solomon loved better than ever




the pious robin


    art thou the bird whom man loves best
    the pious bird with the scarlet breast
         our little english robin
                                      wordsworth

the english robin is not precisely like our little american friend whom
we call by that name although as the lines of poetry quoted above will
show in two ways the is the same as ours the has a red breast and the is
the bird whom every one loves of all the little brothers of the air in
every land and clime the pretty jolly neighborly robin redbreast is
the favorite

there are many stories about him some which tell how the came by his
scarlet breast others which explain why the has always been best beloved
of the birds I have already told how the helped the wren to bring fire
to men every one knows how tenderly the covered with leaves the poor
babes in the wood when they had been deserted even by their nearest of
kin some have heard about saint kentigern and how the restored to life
the pious robin of his master servanthe dear little bird who used to
sing psalms every morning in the saints company some also know about
the robin who brought the wheat-ear in his bill to the poor brothers in
brittany who had no grain to plant for their future harvest all these
tales show the robins generous heart cheerful nature and pious
devotion which make him beloved by men but perhaps you do not know why
he is called gods own bird

    the robin and the wren
    are gods cock and hen

sing the little english children and they think it is very wicked to
injure one of the holy birds or make her unhappy by robbing her nest of
its pretty eggs

this is why the robin is called the good bird gods bird the oldest
stories say that the little christ-child used to feed most tenderly the
robins who hopped about the door of his mothers house for they were
dearest of all to his baby heart perhaps the thus early learned to love
them because his mother had told him of the service which the dear
little birds had once performed for her

for it is said that once upon a time when mary was a little girl as
she was going along the gusty road a bit of straw blew into her eye and
pained her terribly she sat down upon a stone and began to cry now a
robin was sitting on a branch close by singing with all the power of
his little throat when the maiden passed for she was very sweet to see
and the robin loved her looks but when the saw the blessed mary begin to
cry and rub her eye with her chubby hand the stopped his gay song and
became very sad wondering what the could do to help her

what the did was to fly away and tell his friend the swallow all about
it asking her aid after that the fluttered to a little fountain which
bubbled up close by and brought thence in his bill a drop of water
then perching on marys forehead the gently dropped this into the
suffering eye at the same time the swallow softly brushed her long
tail-feathers under the maidens eyelid and the hateful straw was wiped
away thus the little mary was relieved and when once more she could
look up happily with her pretty eyes she smiled upon the two kind birds
and blessed them for their aid

of course if the little christ heard his mother tell this pretty story
he would have been sure to love the robin just as she did and so these
little birds became his boyhood friends

those were happy times but in the after years in the dreadful day
when the saviour was so cruelly done to death by his enemies the little
robin once more proved his generous and pious heart so the legends say

the saviour hung upon the cross suffering and sad while the world was
veiled with darkness and all good creatures mourned two birds perched
upon the cross beside his weary drooping head one was the faithful
robin who was then a plain and dark-colored bird with the scorched
feathers of a fire-bringer upon his breast the other was the magpie
who at that time was among the most gorgeous and beautiful of all the
birds she had a tuft of bright feathers on her head and her plumage
outshone even that of the peacock who has the hundred gleaming eyes of
argus set in his fan-like tail but the magpie in spite of her beauty
was at heart a wicked bird think of it she mocked the dying saviour in
his agony and seemed to rejoice in his suffering

but the robin fluttered about the holy figure timidly uttering chirps
of sorrow and longing to help the master who had fed him tenderly for so
many years with his soft wings the wiped away the tears which flowed
from the lords eyes while with his beak the tugged at the cruel thorns
which pierced his brow trying to relieve him

suddenly a drop of blood fell from christs forehead upon the robins
breast and tinged with bright crimson the rusty reddish feathers

blessed be thou said the lord thou sharer of my suffering wherever
thou goest happiness and joy shall follow thee blue as the heaven shall
be thy eggs and from henceforth thou shalt be the bird of god the
bearer of good tidings but thou the added addressing the magpie
sorrowfully thou art accursed no longer shall the brilliant tuft and
bright feathers of which thou art so proud and so unworthy adorn thee
thy color shall be the streaked black and white of shadows thy life a
hard one and thy nest however well builded shall be open to the
storm

these were almost the last words which the saviour spoke after that
when the lord was laid in the sepulchre the faithful robin still
watched beside him for those three dread days until the rose on easter
morning when the little bird rejoiced with all nature at the wondrous
happening and again on ascension day the paid his last tribute to the
risen master joining his little song with the chorus of the angels
themselves in the gladdest hosanna which the universe had ever heard

this explains how the magpie became a restless noisy black-and-white
bird as we know her to this day having lost all her brilliant beauty
through the wickedness of her heart but the pious robin still wears
upon his breast the beautiful feathers stained red with his masters
blood and all that the saviour foretold of him has come true the is the
blessed bird whom children everywhere love and of whom they still repeat
these old verses

    the robin and the redbreast
       the robin and the wren
    if ye take out of the nest
       yell never thrive again

the robin who was an indian


the name of robin makes us think at once of the jolliest and most
sociable of all our little brother birds in every land the name is a
favorite and wherever the goes the brings happiness and kind feeling

the american robin is not the same bird as his english cousin though
both have red breasts

it was in a different manner that our little american friend came to
have the ruddy waistcoat which we know so well

there was a time so the indians say a very early time long long
before columbus discovered americaeven before histories began to be
writtenwhen there were no robins

in those days in the land of the ojibways which is far in the north of
the cold country there lived an old indian chief who had one son named
iadilla now among the ojibways when a boy was almost big enough to
become a warrior before the could go out with the other braves to the
hunt or to war there was a great trial which the must undergo other
lands and peoples have known similar customs you remember how in
early christian times long long ago galahad and other boys had to
fast and watch by their armor during the long night hours before they
could become knights to wear spurs and shield and sword in just the
same way a brown ojibway lad had to make a long fast in order to win the
love of his guardian spirit who would after that watch over him to make
him brave and strong it was a very important event in a boys life
like graduation from school or college nowadays for this meant the
graduation from boyhood into manhood the winning of a warriors
diploma

the father of iadilla was a brave warrior a famous chief but the wished
his son to become even better wiser greater than the had been he
resolved that the boy should fast longer and harder than ever a lad had
fasted before for the believed that this was the way to make him the
noblest of his race iadilla was a fine handsome lad but the was the
youngest one who had ever made the trial and there were many bigger
boys than the who were not yet warriors the other chiefs said that he
was not yet old and strong enough

but iadillas father declared that it was time and bade his son gather
courage and pride for the ordeal for the said it will be no easy
matter my son to become the greatest chief of the ojibways

my father replied iadilla humbly I will do as you wish I will do
what I can but my strength is not the strength of the bigger boys and
I think it is yet early to talk of my becoming greatest of the ojibways
yet make trial of me if you wish

the father of iadilla had made a little tent of skins where the boy was
to live during his fasting time where the was to lie without food or
drink for twelve long days waiting for a message from the guardian
spirit whose love was to be the reward of such a trial

when the time came the old man led iadilla to the lodge and bade him
lie down on the bed of skins which had been prepared for him and
iadilla did as the was bid for the was a brave and obedient lad

the days crept by the long long days of waiting while iadilla lay in
the lodge bearing hunger and thirst such as no ojibway lad had ever
before known all day and all night the lay still and spoke never a word
but a dreadful fear was in his heart lest the should not be able to
endure the fast for the twelve days which his father had set

every morning his father came to the lodge to praise and to encourage
him and to rejoice in one more day checked from the long time of
fasting so eight days passed and the old man was proud and happy
already his dear son had done more than any ojibway lad and the whole
tribe was praising iadilla saying what a great chief the would be in the
days to come

but on the ninth morning when the father peeped into the lodge to see
how bravely his son was faring the boy turned his head toward the door
and spoke for the first time in all those long days the was very thin
and pale and his voice sounded weak

my father the said I have slept and my dreams were sad I have
slept and my dreams were of failure and weakness the time does not
please my guardian spirit it is not now that I can become a warrior i
am not yet strong and old enough o my father I cannot bear the fast
longer I am so hungry so thirsty so faint let me break my fast and
try again in another year

but the father sternly refused for the was ambitious nay lad he
cried frowningly would you fail me now think of the glory think of
being the greatest of ojibways it is but a few short days now courage
iadilla be a man in strength and patience

iadilla said no more the wrapped himself closer in his blanket and drew
his belt tighter about his slender waist trying to stifle the hunger
gnawing there so the lay silently until the eleventh day that morning
his father came to the lodge beaming proudly

bravo my iadilla the cried only one day more and you will be
released from your fast but iadilla clasped his hands beseechingly

my father gasped the poor boy I cannot bear it another day I am
not fit to be a great chief I have failed give me food or I die

but again the father refused it is but a day now the said but a few
short hours bear a little longer iadilla to-morrow I myself will
bring you the finest breakfast that ever a lad ate courage boy for
the few hours that remain

iadilla was too weak to answer the lay motionless with only a gentle
heaving of his breast to show that the still lived his father left him
for the last time and went to prepare the morrows goodly breakfast
while the tribe planned a fine festival in honor of the young hero

early on the morrow came iadillas father to the tent proudly bearing
the breakfast for his brave boy and smiling to think how gladly he
would be received but the stopped outside the tent door surprised to
hear some one talking within stooping to a little hole in the skin of
the tent the peeped in to find who the speaker might be imagine his
surprise to find iadilla standing upright in the middle of the tent
painting his breast a brilliant red as indians do in war time and as
he daubed on the colors the talked to himself the spoke softly yet not
with the weak voice of a starving lad and his face was very beautiful
to see despite its pale thinness

my father has ended my indian life the said my father too
ambitious has put upon me more than my strength could bear the would
not listen to my prayer of weakness but I knew I knew and my kind
guardian spirit knew also that it was more than I could bear the has
shown pity seeing that I was obedient to my father and did my best to
please him now I am to be no longer an indian boy I must take the
shape which the spirit has given me and go away

at these strange words the father broke into the tent exclaiming in
terror

my son my dear son do not leave me

but even as the spoke iadilla changed into a beautiful robin redbreast
with soft feathers and strong firm wings and fluttering up to the
ridgepole of the tent the looked down with pity and tenderness upon the
heart-broken chief

do not grieve father the sang I shall be so much happier as a bird
free from human pain and sorrow I will cheer you with my merry songs
oh I have been hungry but now I shall get my food so easily so
pleasantly on mountains and in the fields oh once I was thirsty but
now the dew is mine and the little springs once I traced my way
painfully by forest paths through bog and brake and tangled brier but
now my pathways are in the bright clear air where never thorn can tear
nor beast can follow farewell dear father I am so happy

he stretched his brown wings as easily as if the had worn them all his
life and singing a sweet song fluttered away to the neighboring
woods where the built his nest and lived happily ever after

and since that day the glad little robins have lived as that first one
promised close by the homes of men and have done all they could to
cheer us and make us happy for they remember how once upon a time
their ancestor was a human boy




the inquisitive woman


there was once a woman who was so very inquisitive that she wished to
know everything she was never happy unless she was poking her nose into
some mystery and the less a matter concerned her the more curious she
was about it

one day the lord gathered together all the insects in the world all the
beetles bugs bees mosquitoes ants locusts grasshoppers and other
creatures who fly or hop or crawl and shut them up in a huge sack well
tied at the end what a queer squirming muffled-buzzing bundle it
made to be sure

then the lord called the woman to him and said woman I would have you
take this sack and throw it into the sea but be sure and do not untie
the end of it to look inside for the sack must on no account be opened
even for a single minute

the woman took the sack wondering very much at the queer size and shape
and feeling of it and especially at the strange noises which came from
the inside

what can be in the sack she said to herself oh I wish I knew oh
how I wish I knew oh how very very much I wish I knew her
curiosity increased every minute as she went step by step towards the
sea until when she had gone scarcely a hundred paces she stopped short
and said I must know what is inside this sack before I go any farther
I will take just one tiny little peep and the will never know it

very carefully she untied the neck of the sack buzz whirr hum zim
she had opened it but a tiny little crack when out crawled and hopped
and flew the millions and swarms and colonies of all kinds of insects
and away they scattered in every direction such a noise as filled the
air about the astonished womans head such a wriggling and squirming
and hopping in the grass about her feet

oh now I know what was in the sack she cried but I wish I had not
looked oh whatever shall I do the told me to throw the bag into the
ocean without looking in but now the horrid creatures have escaped
everywhere and the will know what I have done oh what will the do to
punish me

she began to run hither and yon like a crazy woman picking up the bugs
and jumping for the fluttering insects trying to put them back into the
bag they stung her and bit her and got into her eyes until she screamed
with pain as fast as she caught one another escaped and she soon saw
that it was a hopeless task she could never catch the millions of
creatures who had scattered away to their homes in every corner of the
world

then the lord came to her and said very sternly o woman you have
disobeyed me just as did the very first woman of all and you must be
punished both for your disobedience and for your inquisitiveness which
has led you into the worse sin not until you have gathered up every one
of these insects which you have permitted to escape back into the world
shall you be happy but I will give you wings to help you in the task
you shall become a woodpecker and it shall be your task to hunt hunt
for the insects which hide away so slyly at your approach not till the
last one of these is gobbled up from the earth shall you return to your
own shape and be a woman once more

then the lord changed the inquisitive woman into a restless woodpecker
and with a tut-tut she darted away in pursuit of the insects which
had brought her into such trouble

and that is why to this day one sees the woodpecker pecking so
frantically on the tree trunks anxious lest a single insect should
escape for she is very tired of being a bird and is longing to become
a woman once more but it will be a very long time I fear before she
gathers up all the wriggling squirming hopping buzzing stinging
biting things that make life in the country so varied exciting and
musical




why the nightingale wakes


when the other birds are sound asleep in their nests with their little
heads tucked comfortably under their feathers sister nightingale they
say may not rest but still sounds the notes of her beautiful song in
grove and thicket

why does she sing thus all night long as well as through the day it is
because she dares not go to sleep on account of the blindworm who is
waiting to catch her with her eyes closed

once upon a time when the world was very new the blindworm was not
quite blind but had one good eye moreover in those days the
nightingale also had but one eye as for the blindworm it mattered very
little for the was a homely creature content to crawl about in the dark
underground or under wood and leaves where nobody saw him and nobody
cared but the nightingales case was really quite too pitiful fancy
the sweetest singer among all the birds the favorite chorister going
about with but one eye while every one else even the tiniest little
humming bird of all had two

the nightingale felt very sore about this matter and tried to conceal
her misfortune from the other birds she managed to cock her head the
other way whenever she met a friend and she always flew past any
stranger so fast that the never saw the empty socket where her other
pretty eye should be

but one day there was great excitement among the birds miss jenny wren
was going to be married to young cock robin there was to be a grand
wedding every one was invited and of course the nightingale was needed
to lead the bridal chorus of feathered songsters but the poor
nightingale was set in a flutter of anxiety by the news

oh dear me she said I do want to go to jennys wedding oh of
course I do but how can I go if I do the other birds will discover
that I have but one eye and then how the disagreeable creatures will
laugh at me oh dear oh dear what shall I do I cannot go no i
really cannot but what excuse can I give oh it is not right that the
sweetest singer in all birdland should be laughed at merely because she
has the misfortune to lack one poor little eye

the nightingale sat on the branch singing so mournfully that all the
creatures on the ground below went sorrowfully about their daily
business just then the nightingale spied a silvery gleam among the dead
leaves it was the blindworm a spotted gray streak writhing
noiselessly along towards the decayed wood of a fallen tree in which he
loved to burrow and the blindworm was not sad like the others neither
seemed the to care in the least about the nightingales music worms
think little of sweet sounds the cocked his one eye up towards the
nightingale and winked maliciously the alone of all creatures knew the
nightingales secret

good-day sister nightingale the said how is your eye this morning
we have a goodly pair between us though I think that mine is rather the
better of the two

then the disappeared into a tiny opening for though the blindworm is
nearly a foot long the is so smooth and slippery that the can enter a hole
which is almost smaller than himself

the nightingale was very indignant at being addressed in this familiar
way by a miserable crawling creature who not only could not fly but
who could not sing a note and did not know do from fa
besides it made her angry to think that the knew her secret and talked
aloud about it so that any one might hear

the idea she cried it is bad enough that I cannot go to the wedding
of my dear friend jenny but to be jeered at by this creature it is
more than I can bear ha I have an idea I will punish him and help
myself at the same time I will steal his one eye and wear it to jenny
wrens wedding then no one will ever discover my misfortune

now this was an excellent scheme but it was not so easy to carry it out
as the nightingale had thought for the blindworm was very timid and
kept himself carefully hidden in his burrow of soft soil as if the half
suspected the nightingales plans day after day the nightingale kept
eager watch upon his movements and at last on the very eve of the
wedding when she had almost given up hope she spied the blindworm
sound asleep on the moss under a tall tree

ha said the nightingale to herself very softly now is my chance
she fluttered into the top of the oak tree and from there hopped down
from branch to branch from twig to twig until she was directly over
the sleepers ugly head over the one closed eye then whirr down
she pounced upon the blindworm and before the creature had a chance to
know what was happening the nightingale had stolen his eye and had
popped it into place in the empty socket on the other side of her beak

ha ha she sang merrily now I have two bright eyes as good as any
ones now I can go to jenny wrens wedding as gayly as I please and no
one shall see more of the ceremony than I I shall be able to tell just
exactly how the bride is dressed how every little feather is arranged
and how she looks after parson crow has pronounced the blessing oh how
happy I am

but the poor blindworm blind indeed from that day forth began to cry
and lament begging the nightingale to give him back his eye

nay said the nightingale did you not laugh at me when you saw me
sadly sitting on the tree mourning because I could not go to the
wedding now I have stolen your eye and I can see famously but you
will never again see me sitting sadly on the tree

then the blindworm grew very angry I will get the eye back the cried
I will steal it from you as you stole it from me some time when you
are asleep I will climb up into your nest some night and I will take
both your eyes of which you are so proud then you will be blind
wholly blind as I am now

at these threatening words the nightingale ceased to sing and became
silent with fear for she knew that the blindworm would do as the said
but again a brilliant thought came to her

nay she trilled gladly that you shall never do I will never sleep
again I will keep awake always night and day with my two bright eyes
ever looking out for danger yes yes yes no one shall ever catch me
napping

you cannot help yourself said the blindworm you cannot keep awake
you will drowse in spite of everything I shall yet find you asleep some
night and then beware

nay nay warbled the nightingale as she flew away to make herself
fine for the wedding I shall sing sing sing night and day henceforth
to keep myself awake and thus I need not fear farewell-well-well

and so the nightingale went to the wedding and sang more sweetly in the
bridal chorus than she had ever sung before and after that although
she was weary oh so weary she sang all night long and all the next
night and the next and so she has continued to sing ever since in the
lands which are blessed by her presence for she dares not go to sleep
even for a single moment knowing that the blindworm is ever ready to
pounce upon her and take away the eyes which she is now enjoying




mrs partridges babies


long long ago when the world was very young indeed the birds and
animals used to send their children to school to mother magpies
kindergarten all the morning long the babies learned their lessons
which it was needful for them to know and when the noon hour came their
various mammas came to the school bringing lunches for the children you
can imagine how gladly they were received by the hungry little scholars

one day mrs partridge was very busy with her house-cleaning and when
the noontime came she could not leave her work to go to the school with
her babies lunch

dear me she said looking out of the nest here it is noon and the
little partridges will be so very hungry but I really cannot leave home
now what shall I do if only some other mamma were going that way

she craned her neck and looked eagerly in every direction and finally
she spied madame tortoise plodding along towards the school with the
lunch for her little turtlets

oho neighbor oho stop a minute cried mrs partridge waving a wing
at tortoise are you going schoolward as I think oh dear madame
tortoise if you knew how busy I am to-day I dont think any one was
ever so busy as I am with my house-cleaning will you do me a favor
please

the tortoise sniffed well I am a busy woman myself she said but i
am willing to oblige a neighbor what is it you wish maam

oh thank you so much cried the partridge dear madame tortoise i
shall never forget your kindness now will you take this bunch of nice
wiggly worms to my little ones for their lunch I shall be so very
grateful

dont mention it snapped the tortoise who was rather tired of
hearing mrs partridges shrill thanks im perfectly willing to take
the lunch since I am going to the same place but I dont know your
babies what do they look like maam

oh that is easily told cried mrs partridge they are the most
beautiful little creatures in the school they are said greatly to
resemble me you will have no trouble in recognizing them when you
come to the school just look around at all the children and pick out
the three most beautiful of all those are certain to be mine give them
the wiggly worms please with my love and oh thank you madame
tortoise so very much some time I will do as much for you so
neighborly thank you

illustration here are some nice fat wiggly worms

dont mention it snapped the tortoise again very much bored by all
this chatter she sniffed as she moved slowly along towards the school
with the second lunch carried carefully on her broad shell-back they
are nice fat worms she said

now when the tortoise came to the school it was high noon and all the
children were waiting open-mouthed for their mammas and the lunches
which they expected such rows and rows of wide hungry mouths madame
tortoise moved slowly up and down and round and round eyeing the
various children who begged for the nice wiggly worms hm she said
to herself hungry children seem to look considerably alike and none
of them are so wondrously beautiful when their mouths are wide open
greedily I wonder which are mrs partridges children she told me to
give this lunch to the handsomest babies here well I will and if i
make a mistake it will not be my fault hello here are my dear little
turtlets bless the babies how pretty they are why I declare I never
realized that they were so handsome certainly they are the
best-looking children in the school then I must give them mrs
partridges luncheon for so I promised yes my little ones here is
your lunch which I brought for you and when you have finished that
here is another some nice fat wiggly worms which mother collected on
the waya prize for the handsomest children in the school

so the little turtlets fared wonderfully well that day but the poor
little partridges went hungry and had dreadful headaches and went home
peeping sadly to their silly mother and mrs partridge had no more
sense than to be angry with madame tortoise which I think was very
unfair dont you for the latter had only done as she was bidden by her
silly and conceited neighbor

but after that the tortoise and the partridge never spoke to each other
and their children would not play together at school




the early girl


there were once two girls who were very dear friends zaïca and
tourtourelle one morning zaïca woke up and said o tourtourelle last
night I had such a strange dream

and so did I cried tourtourelle let us tell each other the dreams
but you first zaïca

zaïca began to laugh I dreamed I was a pretty bird with a tuft of
feathers on my head I could fly and o tourtourelle it was great fun
but the most amusing thing of all was that I could sing so finely and
mock all the birds of the forest nay I could even imitate the sounds
of animals I cannot help laughing when I think what a jolly time i
had

why zaïca cried tourtourelle wondering I dreamed the very same
thing I too was a pretty little bird and I too could imitate all kinds
of sounds as I fluttered in the tree-tops surely the dream will come
true for one of us how fine that would be

yes let it be for the one of us who first rises to-morrow morning
said zaïca and so the two friends agreed

now when it came night-time zaïca went to bed very early like a wise
little girl who wants to rise with the sun but tourtourelle said to
herself I know what I will do I will not go to sleep I will sit up
all night and then I am sure to be the first to rise

so tourtourelle perched herself on a high-backed chair and stretched her
eyes wide open for hours and hours she sat there growing more sleepy
every minute towards morning she began to nod she could hardly keep
her eyes open though she tried to prop the lids with her finger tips
finally whether she would or no she fell fast asleep poor little
tourtourelle worn out with her long vigil

when the first morning sunbeam peeped into the chamber zaïca opened her
eyes refreshed and smiling she sat up in bed remembering the dream
and then jumped lightly to the floor as she did so she glanced at her
feet which felt queer wonderful they were little bird claws she
looked down at herself she was covered with soft feathers she tried to
move her arms and when she did so she rose lightly from the floor and
skimmed out of the window into the garden zaïca had become a pretty
little bird just as she had dreamed oh how happy she was she heard a
lark singing far up in the sky opening her mouth she warbled and
trilled as well as the until the dropped down quickly to the earth
thinking it must be his mate who sang so sweetly she spied a chicken
strayed too far from the mother hen and chuckling to herself
mischievously she imitated the warning cry of a hawk till the chick ran
squawking back to the shelter of his mothers wing she heard a hound
baying afar off and with little trouble echoed the sound so perfectly
that a groom came running out of the stable whistling for the dog which
he feared was straying from the kennel zaïca found that as in her dream
she could imitate all the sounds which she heard and she was so pleased
that she sang and sang and sang hopping from tree to tree teasing the
other birds with her mockery and puzzling them too

as for poor tourtourelle when she waked it was very late she yawned
and rubbed her eyes languidly for she was still sleepy then looking
across to zaïcas bed she saw that it was empty her heart gave a great
thump for she longed and longed to be a bird but now she feared that
she was too late in her white gown she ran out into the garden looking
for zaïca but first she saw an old man leading his cow to the pasture
and to the cow the said coo-roo coo-roo coaxing her to hasten

coo-roo coo-roo cried tourtourelle imitating him she knew not why
and as she said it she wondered at the strange feeling which came over
her for her body felt very light and it seemed as if she could fly she
looked down and saw that she was no longer covered with a little white
gown but with soft feathers of ashy gray while wings sprouted from her
shoulders

oh I have become a bird she tried to say but all she uttered
wascoo-roo coo-roo for tourtourelle was become a beautiful
turtle-dove and that is all a turtle-dove can say

coo-roo coo-roo mocked a voice from the tree and cocking her little
reddish eye tourtourelle saw a brilliant jay hopping in the branches
imitating a dove then it was the song of a wren that she heard then a
lark then a thrush then a sparrow-hawkall these sounds coming from
the one little throat of the happy bird on that bough tourtourelle
tried to do likewise but all she could sing was coo-roo coo-roo and
she said mournfully to herself

it is zaïca she was wiser than I and earlier and the dream came
true for her oh dear oh dear and to this day turtle-dove flies about
sadly uttering her monotonous cry and listening with a longing that
would be envy were she not so good a little bird to the chatter of her
friend the jay

for zaïca the jay is always merry hopping from tree to tree playing
her jokes upon the other birds whom she deceives with her wonderful
voice and she leads a life so gay and exciting that she never finds
time to be sad even over the disappointment of her dear friend poor
little tourtourelle




how the blackbird spoiled his coat


once upon a time our friend blackbird who comes first of the feathered
brothers in the spring was not black at all no indeed the was
whitewhite as feather-snow new fallen in the meadow there are very
few birds who have been thought worthy to dress all in beautiful white
for that is the greatest honor which a bird can have so like the swan
and the dove master whitebirdfor that is what they called him
thenwas very proud of his spotless coat

he was very proud and happy and the sang all day long the jolliest
songs but you see the did not really deserve this honor because the was
at heart a greedy bird and therefore a great shame came upon him and
after that the was never proud nor happy any more I shall tell you the
story of how the whitebird grew grimy and gloomy as we know him almost
as black and solemn as old daddy crow

once upon a time then master whitebird was teetering on a rose-bush
ruffling his beautiful white feathers and singing little bits of poetry
about himself to any one who would listen

    ho-ho ho-hee
    just look at me

he piped and cocked his little eyes about in every direction to see
who might be admiring his wondrous whiteness

but all on a sudden his song gurgled down into his throat and choked
itself still and his eyes fixed themselves upon a tree close by it was
a dead old tree and there was a hole in the trunk halfway up to the
lowest limb a round little hole about as big as your two fists

whitebird had seen something black pop into that hole in a sly and
secret way and the began to wonder for the was inquisitive as most
birds are the sat quite still on his rose-bush and watched and watched
presently out of the hole popped a black head bigger than whitebirds
with two wise little twinkling eyes

oho said whitebird to himself it is mother magpie up to her old
tricks hiding hiding maybe she has a treasure hidden there I will
watch and perhaps I shall find out something worth knowing

mother magpie was the wisest and the slyest of all the birds and it was
always worth while as whitebird knew to take lessons of her so the sat
perfectly still until she came cautiously back carrying something in her
beak it was round and white and glinted like moonlight whitebirds
eyes stuck out greedily

it is a piece of silver the thought but the sat perfectly still until
the magpie had stowed the coin safely in the hollow tree and had hopped
away as if upon an unfinished errand aha there is more then I will
watch to see what comes next said whitebird and the waited

sure enough in a little while the magpie returned this time bringing
something which glowed yellow like sunlight

it is a piece of gold gasped whitebird and his eyes bulged out like
those of lobsters the was so jealous of her luck but the silently
watched her disappear into her tree-cupboard and then hastily depart as
before toward the mountain what comes next muttered whitebird to
himself I am dying to peep into that hole I cannot wait much longer

then after a while a third time came back the magpie to the dead tree
and lo what she carried in her beak twinkled and trembled and shone in
many colors like a drop of dew on a velvet flower-cheek when
whitebird saw this sight the nearly tumbled off his perch with
excitement

it is a diamond the cried aloud oh it is a real diamond

at this sudden noise from the rose-bush mother magpies nerves were so
shocked that she dropped the diamond helter-skelter into the hole and
in a moment she fell in after it out of sight she hoped that no one
had seen her but little whitebird knew the place the hopped after her
and perching on the edge of the hole peered down into the hollow tree
and there the saw a great heap of silver and gold and precious stones
which mother magpie was trying to cover with her wings

oh what a treasure what a treasure the piped greedily mother
magpie you must tell me where you found it that I may go and get some
for myself

but mother magpie refused to tell

oho chirped whitebird angrily we shall see about that then I will
call in the fierce birds robber hawk and fighting falcon and the bloody
butcher bird and they will take your treasure from you and kill you
too into the bargain what do you think of that mother magpie

then she was afraid for she knew those bad birds and she saw that she
must trust her secret with whitebird since the had already discovered
half the truth

well if you will promise me not to let any one else know not even
king eagle I will tell you she said so whitebird promised

listen said the magpie you must find the cave which is near the
tallest oak on the mountain under the flat stone in a corner there is
a tiny hole just big enough for you or me to pass and this is the
entrance to a passage which leads down into the cellars of the earth
and when you have gone down and down farther than any one except myself
ever went before you will come to the palace of the king of riches it
is full of gold and silver and precious stones like these you see here
each chamber is more beautiful and more tempting than the last but you
must not touch a stone or a single coin or even a little bit of
gold-dust until you have seen the king for first you must offer
yourself to be his servant and then the will be generous then the will
let you carry away as much treasure as your beak will hold that is all
there is to it but beware greedy whitebird take my advice and do not
touch a grain of treasure before you see the king or great evil will
befall you

whitebird promised to do as she said and then away the flew to the blue
mountain and its tallest oak close by the great oak in a lonely spot
he found the flat rock and under it was the cave where once a bear had
lived whitebird hopped in eagerly and away back in one corner of the
cave the found a little round hole as the magpie had said a hole not
much bigger than an apple it must have been a tight squeeze for fat
mother magpie

whitebird hopped through the hole and found himself in a long narrow
passage which led down down down into places where his eyes were of no
use at all for the was not like master owl who can see better in the
dark than anywhere else blindly the hopped on and on till the came into
a great cavern bright with a white radiance as if the moonlight
filtered in from somewhere it was the first room of the kings palace
of treasure and it was all of silver paved with silver heaped with
silver shining with silver whitebirds eyes glittered and the wanted to
stop and take some for himself but just in time the remembered the wise
warning of mother magpie and so the hopped on over the silver pebbles
through a silver door into a second room and this was flooded with
yellow light as of sunshine so dazzling that for a moment whitebirds
yellow eyes could see nothing at all when the could see the place
seemed full of yellow eyes like his own great yellow eyes heaped up
from floor to ceiling and when the became used to this the looked again
and saw that these were golden coins and that this was a cavern all of
gold

oh such a wonderful sight oh such a golden dream the floor on which
he stood was deep with gold dust which squished between his toes like
yellow sand on a sea beach and then whitebird lost his head and went
quite mad forgetting the words of wise mother magpie

gold dust gold dust a treasure for me the sang hopping up and down
on one leg I can carry away a great beakful of the yellow seeds and
each one will blossom into a golden flower for mefor mefor me he
was wholly crazy as you see

he thrust his bill deep into the gold dust of the floor and greedily
filled it more than full till it dropped over his white white feathers
and splashed his coat so that the was no longer a white bird but a yellow
bird oh the silly greedy thing but there are worse fates than being
a yellow bird

just at this moment a dreadful roar echoed through the caverns till they
rumbled like an earthquake and into the golden chamber crashed a
horrible dragon-creature the guardian of the kings treasure his eyes
blazed red like coals and from his mouth came smoke and flame so that
the gold melted before his breath the rushed straight upon poor little
whitebird to gobble him up and as the came the roared thief thief who
steals my masters treasure I scorch you with my eye I burn you with
my breath I swallow you into the furnace of my throat gr-r-r-r

there seemed no chance for whitebird to escape the creature was so
near but with a cry of terror the fluttered and hopped away as fast as
he could toward the narrow passage through the gold chamber and the
silver chamber leaving all the treasure behind oh dont you wish we
could have known how the diamond chamber looked with its rainbow
light

whitebird hopped and fluttered fluttered and hopped feeling the
dragons hot breath close behind frizzling his feathers and blinding his
eyes with smoke the seemed like to be roasted alive in this horrible
underground oven but oh there was the hole close before him pouf
with a terrible roar the dragon snapped at him as whitebird popped
through the hole but the got only a mouthful of burnt tail-feathers
whitebird was safe safe in the narrow passage where the dragon could
not follow up and up and up and up the feebly fluttered into the light
of the dear outside world and then the gave a chirp of joy to find that
he really had escaped but oh how tired and frightened the was

mother magpie was sitting on a bush waiting for him for she had guessed
what would happen to the greedy bird and when she saw him she gave a
squawk of laughter

o whitebird she chuckled what a sight what a sight your lovely
coat your spotless feathers oh you greedy greedy blackbird

then the who had been whitebird looked down at himself and saw what a
dreadful thing had happened and the closed his eyes and gave a hoarse
sad croak for the smoke and flame of the dragons breath had smirched
and scorched him from top to toe so that the was no longer white but
thenceforth and forever blackbird

I think mother magpie must have told the story to her children
chuckling over the greedy fellows failure and they told it to the
children of sunny france from whom I got the tale for you so now you
know why the blackbird looks so solemn and so sulky in his suit of rusty
black and why his nerves are so weak that if one suddenly surprises
him picking up seeds in the field the gives a terrible scream of
fright for the thinks one is that dreadful dragon-creature who chased
him and so nearly gobbled him on that unlucky day long ago

poor brother blackbird dont let him know I told you all this it would
make him so very much ashamed




the blackbird and the fox


one day madame fox who was strolling along under the hedge heard a
blackbird trilling on a branch quick as thought she jumped and seized
the little fellow and was about to gobble him down then and there but
the blackbird began to chirp piteously

oh oh madame fox what are you thinking of just see I am such a
tiny mouthful and when I am goneI am gone only let me free and i
will tell you something look here come some peasant women with eggs
and cheese which they are carrying to the market at verrières that
would be a meal worth having only let me go and I will help you
master fox

the fox saw that this might be a good plan which the bird proposed so
she let him go

and what do you think the blackbird did the began to hop hop hop
toward the women dragging his wing behind him as if it were broken
which is a trick some birds know very well

look cried one of the women when she caught sight of him oh look
at the little blackbird there his wing is broken and the cannot fly i
shall try to catch him and she ran as fast as she could making her
hands into a little cage to put over him the other women too set down
their baskets for convenienceset them down right in the middle of the
roadand joined the chase after the poor little blackbird so lame so
lame but always as they came close to him the managed to flutter out
of reach

meanwhile madame fox went round about by the hedge and came all quietly
and unseen to the place where the baskets waited in the road and oh
what a good dinner she found there chickens and eggs and fresh cheese
nicely done up for the market and the greedy old lady ate them allall
the chickens and the eggs and the cheeses my how fat she was when all
was done

now the blackbird hopped on and on for a long long way until by
cocking his eye the saw that madame fox had finished her dinner and
then houff up the flew with a jolly chirp of laughter right over the
heads of the astonished women what of his broken wing now the began to
whistle to sing to chirrup like a crazy bird up there in the air the
women looked at one another sheepishly

ah the wicked blackbird they said one would have thought that he
could not fly at all but look at him the sly creature oho it is a
pretty trick the has played us

they turned back to where they had left their baskets intending to
start on for the market but when they came therewell well what a
shamethey found the eggs the chickens the cheeses all goneeaten
up by the greedy fox and then they began to scold and cry

oh what misfortune they wailed we have lost our eggs our
chickens and our cheeses and there is nothing left to carry to market
we have not even a blackbird to show for our mornings work oh dear oh
dear it is all the fault of that wicked deceitful little bird

and instead of going on to verrières they turned about with their
empty baskets and went back home a sorry party scolding and crying all
the way but long before they reached their homes and their angry
husbands madame fox was comfortably snoozing her after-dinner nap under
the hedge while the happy blackbird picked up juicy bugs in the
neighboring meadow with one eye cocked to guard against being surprised
a second time by any bushy-tailed rogue

illustration the managed to flutter out of reach




the dove who spoke truth


the dove and the wrinkled little bat once went on a journey together
when it came towards night a storm arose and the two companions sought
everywhere for a shelter but all the birds were sound asleep in their
nests and the animals in their holes and dens they could find no
welcome anywhere until they came to the hollow tree where old master owl
lived wide awake in the dark

let us knock here said the shrewd bat I know the old fellow is not
asleep this is his prowling hour and but that it is a stormy night he
would be abroad huntingwhat ho master owl the squeaked will you
let in two storm-tossed travelers for a nights lodging

gruffly the selfish old owl bade them enter and grudgingly invited them
to share his supper the poor dove was so tired that she could scarcely
eat but the greedy bats spirits rose as soon as the saw the viands
spread before him the was a sly fellow and immediately began to flatter
his host into good humor the praised the owls wisdom and his courage
his gallantry and his generosity though every one knew that however
wise old master owl might be the was neither brave nor gallant as for
his generosityboth the dove and the bat well remembered his
selfishness towards the poor wren when the owl alone of all the birds
refused to give the little fire-bringer a feather to help cover his
scorched and shivering body

all this flattery pleased the owl the puffed and ruffled himself trying
to look as wise gallant and brave as possible the pressed the bat to
help himself more generously to the viands which invitation the sly
fellow was not slow to accept

during this time the dove had not uttered a word she sat quite still
staring at the bat and wondering to hear such insincere speeches of
flattery suddenly the owl turned to her

as for you miss pink-eyes the said gruffly you keep careful
silence you are a dull table-companion pray have you nothing to say
for yourself

yes exclaimed the mischievous bat have you no words of praise for
our kind host methinks the deserves some return for this wonderfully
generous agreeable tasteful well-appointed luxurious elegant and
altogether acceptable banquet what have you to say o little dove

but the dove hung her head ashamed of her companion and said very
simply

o master owl I can only thank you with all my heart for the
hospitality and shelter which you have given me this night I was beaten
by the storm and you took me in I was hungry and you gave me your
best to eat I cannot flatter nor make pretty speeches like the bat i
never learned such manners but I thank you

what cried the bat pretending to be shocked is that all you have
to say to our obliging host is the not the wisest bravest most gallant
and generous of gentlemen have you no praise for his noble character as
well as for his goodness to us I am ashamed of you you do not deserve
such hospitality you do not deserve this shelter

the dove remained silent like cordelia in the play she could not speak
untruths even for her own happiness

truly you are an unamiable guest snarled the owl his yellow eyes
growing keen and fierce with anger and mortified pride you are an
ungrateful bird miss and the bat is right you do not deserve this
generous hospitality which I have offered this goodly shelter which you
asked away with you leave my dwelling pack off into the storm and see
whether or not your silence will soothe the rain and the wind be off i
say

yes away with her echoed the bat flapping his leathery wings and
the two heartless creatures fell upon the poor little dove and drove her
out into the dark and stormy night

poor little dove all night she was tossed and beaten about shelterless
in the storm because she had been too truthful to flatter the vain old
owl but when the bright morning dawned draggled and weary as she was
she flew to the court of king eagle and told him all her trouble great
was the indignation of that noble bird

for his flattery and his cruelty let the bat never presume to fly
abroad until the sun goes down the cried as for the owl I have
already doomed him to this punishment for his treatment of the wren but
henceforth let no bird have anything to do with either of them the bat
or the owl let them be outcasts and night-prowlers enemies to be
attacked and punished if they appear among us to be avoided by all in
their loneliness flattery and inhospitality deceit and crueltywhat
are more hideous than these let them cover themselves in darkness and
shun the happy light of day as for you little dove let this be a
lesson to you to shun the company of flatterers who are sure to get you
into trouble but you shall always be loved for your simplicity and
truth and as a token of our affection your name shall be used by poets
as long as the world shall last to rhyme with love

the words of the wise king eagle are true to this day so now you know
why a great many poems came to be written in which the rhymes dove and
love have not seemed to make any particular sense




the fowls on pilgrimage


once upon a time old lady fox was very hungry but she had nothing to
eat and there was no sign of a dinner to be had anywhere

what shall I do what shall I do whined the fox I am so faint and
hungry but all the birds and all the fowls are afraid of me and will
not venture near enough for me to consult them about a dinner I have so
bad a name that no one will trust me what can I do to win back the
respect of the community and earn a square meal ah I have it I will
turn pious and go upon a pilgrimage that ought to make me popular once
more

so the fox started upon the pilgrimage she had not gone very far when
she met a cock but the knew the character of madame fox too well to
trust himself near the flew up into a tree and from that safe perch
crowed jauntily good morning madame fox whither away so fast

the fox drew down the corners of her mouth trying to look pious and
rolled up her eyes as she answered in a hollow voice oh master cock
I am going on a pious pilgrimage I am sorry for my wicked life and now
I am going to be good

ah said the cock I am indeed glad to hear that going on a
pilgrimage are you well in that case I will go with you

do master cock do answered the fox fervently it will do you good
come sit upon my broad back and I will carry you

the cock thanked her and climbed upon her back and so they proceeded on
their pilgrimage together after a while they came upon a dove which
fluttered away hastily when she saw old lady fox knowing too well her
wicked tricks but the fox called to her in a gentle voice

do not be afraid o dove I know why you start at my approach but i
have repented of my former sins and have turned pilgrim my friend the
cock and I have just started upon our pious journey will you join us

when the innocent dove saw the cock upon the foxs back she thought that
certainly everything must be safe so she answered

yes madame fox I will go with you

jump right up on my back there is plenty of room beside the cock
said the fox cordially

a little further on they met a wild duck who waddled away quacking
wildly when the saw the fox trotting towards him but the sly old lady
called out to him smiling

be calm little brother I have given up my former unkind tricks for
which I sadly repent and now I am going on a pious pilgrimage see
your friends the cock and the dove are my companions

in that case I will go along too said the duck for you have a
goodly party

that is right replied the fox approvingly I thought you would go
kindly take a back seat with the others

now when these queer pilgrims had traveled for some time they came to a
cave in the rocks a deep dark cave which looked like a den and here
the fox stopped saying

dear brothers it is time that we paused and thought more carefully
about our sins we must cross seas and rivers and heaven knows when we
shall reach the end of our journey let us listen to one anothers
confessions for I am sure we have all been miserable sinners come mr
cock come into the cave with me and I will hear you first

the cock followed her into the cave saying with some surprise why
madame fox what have I done that is wicked

do you not know answered the fox sternly why do you not begin to
crow at midnight and wake poor tired people out of their first sleep go
to you ought to be ashamed then again you crow at the most
inconveniently early hour in the morning and make the caravans mistake
the true time so that they start upon their journeys long before the
proper hour and fall into the hands of robbers who prowl about before
light these are dreadful sins mr cock and you deserve to be
punished so the wicked old fox seized the cock and ate him all up

after the fox had finished him she came to the entrance of the cave and
called now you come little dove and tell me what you have done that
is naughty

but I have done nothing said the innocent dove wondering very much
of what evil do you accuse me madame fox

when the farmers sow their grain you dig up the yellow kernels and eat
them for your dinner that is stealing which is a wicked wicked sin
and must be severely punished cried the hungry fox and thereupon she
seized the poor little dove and ate her up

once more the fox stood at the door of the cave stealthily licking her
chops and she called out to the duck come in mr duck and I will
hear what you have to say

well I have not done anything wrong said the duck positively and
you cannot say that I have can you now madame fox

oh indeed and indeed exclaimed the fox have you not stolen the
kings gold crown and do you not wear it on your head you wicked
creature

indeed and indeed I have done no such thing it is not true madame
fox as I can prove wait a bit and I will bring witnesses

so the duck went out and flew up and down in front of the cave waiting
presently along came a hunter with a gun who espied the duck and aimed
the weapon at him

dont shoot me cried the duck what have you against me o hunter i
can tell you where to find worthier game come with me and I will show
you a wicked old fox who eats innocent birds

very well said the hunter putting up his gun show me the place and
I will spare you

the duck led him softly to the entrance of the cave and pausing there
cried out to the fox inside come out madame fox I have brought the
witness

let him come in let him come in cried the fox for she had grown
very hungry indeed and hoped for a double meal

no indeed answered the duck the insists that you must come out so
the fox crept stealthily to the door but as soon as she popped out her
wicked old head the hunter was ready for her and bang that was the end
of the foxs pilgrimage

the duck also had had enough of being a pilgrim the went home with the
hunter and became a tame duck and lived happily ever after on the pond
near the hunters house




the ground-pigeon


once upon a time there was a little malay maiden who lived in the forest
with her father and mother and baby sister they dwelt very happily
together until one day cooras father decided to clear the ground on
the edge of the forest and have a rice plantation as many of his
neighbors were doing

so one morning early after breakfast the started out with his axe on his
shoulder to cut down the trees and make a clearing

o father let me go with you begged coora I do so want to see the
plantation grow from the very beginning

but her father said no she must stay at home until the trees were
felled

and after that may I go with you asked coora and her father promised
that it should be so

the days went by and at last the trees were all felled in the clearing
when coora heard this she jumped up and down on her little bare brown
feet until her anklets tinkled and cried o father now I may go with
you to the clearing may I not for so you promised

but again her father shook his head and said no coora not yet you
must wait until the fallen timber has been burned off then you shall go
with your mother and me to the planting of the rice

coora was very much disappointed and the big tears stood in her eyes
but she only said do you promise that I may help plant the rice
really and truly

and the called back over his shoulder I promise

at last the fallen timber was burned away and the ground was ready for
planting one morning coora saw her father and mother making ready to go
out together oh where are you going father and mother she asked

we go to the planting of the rice answered her father slinging a big
bag over his shoulder

but you promised that I should go with you when that time came cried
coora wistfully please please may I not be your little helper

no no coora answered her mother impatiently do not tease us so
you must stay at home to take care of your little sister be a good
girl this time and when the rice is well grown we will all go together
and harvest it that will be great fun

shall I really go do you promise mother asked poor coora hopefully
for she felt sure that her mother would not deceive her

I promise said the mother not looking her in the eyes and the
parents went away through the forest to plant the rice

time went by until the rice had grown tall and was ready for the
harvest now coora heard her parents talking of the matter and she was
very gay for now she expected a happy happy day she dressed herself
and made ready to go to the harvesting as her parents had promised but
when she joined them smiling joyfully they turned upon her frowning
and bade her return to the house and take care of everything until their
home-coming then poor little coora burst into tears and said o my
father and o my mother I have obeyed you without a word every time you
broke your promise to me and still you continue to put me off from day
to day when this is the thing I long to do so much that it seems as if
my heart would break think of it the clearing has been made the
timber burned the rice planted and grown and now it is ready for the
harvest but I have not even seen the place where all this has
happened o father and mother why are you so unkind to me

there there cried her father and mother together do not make a
fuss over so small a matter you cannot go to-day but wait until the
rice is gathered and it is time to tread it out then we will let you
help us you may be sure we promise coora that you shall really and
truly go

you promise echoed coora bitterly you have promised me before and
nothing came of it but even while she spoke the unkind parents were
gone

then coora fell to weeping most sorely for she knew that she could not
trust the word of her father and mother and that is a most terrible
thing at last she rose and wiped away the tears and looked about the
little cottage where she had been patient through so many
disappointments and she said to herself I can bear it no longer it
is not right that I should be made to suffer like this when a little
thing would make me so happy I must see the rice field I will go
to-day

coora tidied the cottage putting everything in its place and making it
look as beautiful as she could then she took up the little sister who
had fallen asleep on the floor and kissing her tenderly placed her in
the hammock which swung from wall to wall of the hut lastly coora took
off the golden bracelets and earrings and the tinkling anklets which she
wore like other little malay girls and left them in a shining heap
behind the door but she kept her necklace about her pretty little neck

now coora had learned a little magic from a witch just enough magic to
serve her turn she went out and picked two palm leaves which she
fastened on her shoulders and changed herself into a bird a bright
beautiful ground-pigeon with many-colored metallic feathers but the
necklace still made a band about her pretty little neck as you may see
on every ground-pigeon to this day

coora the ground-pigeon fluttered away through the forest until she came
to the rice plantation where her parents were at work she alighted on a
dead tree close by them and called out mother o mother I have left
my earrings and bracelets behind the door and have put my little sister
in the hammock

astonished at these words her mother looked up but saw no one only a
ground-pigeon perched on the tree over her head father she cried to
her husband who was at work beside her did you not hear cooras voice
just now

yes I thought so answered the father angrily the wicked girl must
have disobeyed me and have followed us here after all I will punish her
if this is so they called to her coora coora until the forest
reëchoed but no one appeared or answered

I will go home and see if she is there said the mother either i
heard coora speak or there is some magic in the forest and she
hastened back to the cottage there she found the baby in the hammock
and the bracelets and earrings in a shining heap behind the door as the
voice had said but there was no coora anywhere surprised and anxious
once more the mother ran back to the plantation

coora is gone husband she cried it must have been her own voice
which we heard just now hark she speaks again

again from the tree they heard a sweet voice calling mother o mother
I have left my earrings and bracelets behind the door and my little
sister in the hammock good-by coo-o-o-ra as she spoke her own name
cooras voice warbled and crooned into the soft coo of a
ground-pigeons note and her parents glancing up saw that this bird
must be their child their coora magically changed

let us cut down the tree and catch the wicked girl cried the father
and seizing his axe the chopped away lustily until the tree fell with a
crash but even at that moment the pigeon fluttered away to another
tree crooning again the soft syllables which she has spoken ever since
coo-ra coo-ra coo

from tree to tree about the rice plantation the distracted parents
pursued the pigeon but it was in vain to try to capture her ever she
escaped them when they seemed about to lay hands upon her soft feathers
after following her flight for many miles they were obliged to return
home sad and sorry and repentant for they knew now that it was their
own unkindness and their broken promises which had driven their daughter
away from the cottage never to return

the beautiful ground-pigeon still lingers near the rice plantations
which she had so longed to visit still she plaintively calls her name
and still she wears the necklace about her pretty little neck and the
little malay maidens love her very dearly because she was once a girl
like them




sister hen and the crocodile


the crocodile is one of the hungriest bodies that ever lived when the is
looking for a dinner the will eat almost anything that comes within
reach sometimes the greedy fellow swallows great stones and chunks of
wood in his hurry mistaking them for something more digestible and
when the is smacking his great jaws over his food the makes such a greedy
terrible noise that the other animals steal away nervously and hide
until it shall be master crocodiles sleepy-time the is too lazy to
waddle in search of a dinner far from the river where the lives but any
animal or even a man-swimmer had best be careful how the ventures into
the water near the crocodiles haunts for what seems to be a
greenish-brown knobby log of wood floating on the water has little
bright eyes which are on the lookout for anything which moves and below
the water two great jaws are ready to open and swallow in the prey of
mr hungry-mouth

but no matter how hungry the crocodile may be the will not touch the
hen even if she should venture into his very jaws at least that is
what the black men of the congo river will tell you and surely as they
are the nearest neighbors of the big reptile they ought to know if any
one does now this is the story which they tell to explain why the
crocodile will not eat the hen

once upon a time there was a hen a common plump clucky mother hen
who used every day to go down to the river and pick up bits of food on
the moist banks where luscious insects were many she did not know that
this congo river was the home of the crocodile the biggest fiercest
scaliest hungriest crocodile in all africa but one day when she went
down to the water as usual she hopped out onto what looked like a mossy
log saying to herself

aha this is a fine old timber-house it is full of juicy bugs I know
I shall have a great feast

tap-tap pick-pick the hen began to scratch and peck upon the rough
bark of the log but oh dear me suddenly she began to feel very
seasick the log was rolling over the log was teetering up on end like
a boat in a storm and before she knew what was really happening the
poor hen found herself floundering in the water in the very jaws of the
terrible crocodile

ha ha cried the crocodile in his harsh voice you took me for a
log just as the other silly creatures do but I am no log mrs hen as
you shall soon see I am hungry crocodile and you will make the fifth
dinner which I have had this evening

the hen was frightened almost to death but she kept her presence of
mind and gasped frantically as she saw the great jaws opening to swallow
her

o brother dont

now the crocodile was so surprised at hearing the hen call him brother
that the kept his jaws wide open and forgot to swallow his dinner he
kept them open for some time gaping foolishly wondering what the hen
could mean and how the could possibly be her brother and by the time he
had remembered how hungry the was there was nothing for him to eat for
the hen had skipped away just as fast as her feet would take her

pouf snorted the crocodile her brother indeed I am not her
brother and she knows it very well what a fool I was to be caught by
such a word just wait till I catch her again and we will see I will
brother her and the swam sulkily away to hide his mortification in
the congo mud with only the end of his long nose poking out as a
ventilator for his breathing

now though the hen had had so narrow an escape it had not sufficiently
taught her a lesson a few days afterwards once more she went down to
the river for she could not resist the temptation of the bug-dinner
which she knew she should find there but she kept her eyes open sharply
for any greeny log which might be floating on the water saying to
herself old hungry-mouth shall not catch me napping this time I know
his wicked tricks

but this time the crocodile was not floating on the water like a greeny
log the was lying still as still sunning himself on the river bank
behind some tall reeds mrs hen came trotting down to the water a
plump and tempting sight cocking her head knowingly on one side as she
spied a real log floating out beyond which she took to be her enemy
and as she scratched in the soft mud chuckling to think how sly she
was with a rush and a rustle down pounced the crocodile upon her and
once more before she knew it she found herself in the horrid gateway
of his jaws threatened by the double rows of long white teeth

illustration o brother dont

oho snapped the crocodile you shall not escape me this time i
am a log am I look at me again mrs hen am I a log and the came at
her to swallow her at once

but again the hen squawked o brother dont

again the crocodile paused thunderstruck by this extraordinary word
oh bother the hen the cried what can she mean really how can I be
her brother she lives in a town on the land and I live in my kingdom
of mud and water how could two creatures possibly be more unlike
howbut while the had been thinking of these hows once more the hen
had managed to escape and was pelting back to her barnyard as fast as
she could go

then indeed the crocodile was angry the determined to go and see nzambi
the wise witch princess about the matter she would tell him what it
all meant but it was a long journey to her palace and the was awkward
and slow in traveling upon land before the had gone very far the was
tired and out of breath and stopped to rest under a banana tree

as the lay panting in the shade the saw his friend mbambI the great
lizard hurrying past through the jungle

oh mbambI cried old hungry-mouth stop a moment I want to speak
with you I am in great trouble

so the lizard drew near wagging her head wisely for it pleased her to
be consulted by the big crocodile what can it be dear friend that is
troubling you this day she said amiably surely no one would be so
rude or rash as to offend the king of congo river but tell me your
trouble and perhaps I can advise you

listen to me then said the crocodile almost every day a nice fat
henoh mbambI so delightfully fat and temptingcomes to my river
to feed well why dont I make her my dinner you ask now hearken
each time just as I am about to catch her and carry her to my home she
startles me by calling me brother did you ever hear of anything so
maddening twice I have let her escape because of the word but I can
stand it no longer and I am on the way to princess nzambI to hold a
palaver about it by palaver the slangy crocodile meant a long
serious talk

silly idiot cried the mbambI not very politely do nothing of the
kind you will only get the worst of the palaver and show your ignorance
before the wise nzambI now listen to me dont you know dear
crocodile that the duck lives on the water though she is neither a
fish nor a reptile and the duck lays eggs the turtle does the same
though she is no bird the hen lays eggs just as I do and I am mbambi
the great lizard as for you dear old hungry-mouth you know that at
this momenthere she whispered discreetly looking around to see that
no one was listeningat this moment in a snug nest dug out of the
sand on the banks of the congo mrs crocodile has covered with leaves
to hide them from your enemies sixty smooth white eggs and in a few
weeks out of these will scamper sixty little wiggly crocodiles your
dear homely scaly hungry-mouthed children yes we all lay eggs my
silly friend and so in a sense we are all brothers as the hen has
said

sh whispered the crocodile nervously dont mention those eggs of
mine I beg of you some one might overhear what you say is undoubtedly
true the added pensively after thinking a few moments then I suppose
I must give up my tempting dinner of hen I cannot eat my sister can
i

of course you cannot said the mbambI as the rustled away through the
jungle we cant have everything we want in this world

no I see we cannot sighed the crocodile as the waddled back towards
the banks of the congo now in the same old spot the found the hen who
had been improving his absence by greedily stuffing herself on
beetle-bugs flies and mosquitoes until she was so fat that she could
not run away at the crocodiles approach she could only stand and
squawk feebly fluttering her ridiculous wings

but the crocodile only said good evening sister very politely and
passing her by with a wag of his enormous tail sank with a plop into the
waters of the congo

and ever since that time the hen has eaten her dinner in tranquil peace
undisturbed by the sight of floating log or basking shape of knobby
green for she knows that old hungry-mouth will not eat his sister the
hen




the thrush and the cuckoo


in the wonderful days of old it is said that christ and saint peter went
together upon a journey it was a beautiful day in march and the earth
was just beginning to put on her summer gorgeousness as the two
travelers were passing near a great forest they spied a thrush sitting
on a tree singing and singing as hard as the could and the cocked his
head as if the was very proud of something

saint peter stopped at the foot of the tree and said I wish you a good
day thrush

I have no time to thank you chirped the thrush pertly

why not pretty thrush asked saint peter in surprise you have all
the time in the world and nothing to do but sing

you mistake cried the thrush I am making the summer it is I I i
who make the green grass grow and the flowers bud look how even now
the world is growing beautiful in answer to my song and the conceited
little bird continued to warble as hard as the could

    to-day I shall marry I and no other
    to-morrow my brother

christ and saint peter looked at each other and smiled then went upon
their way without another word leaving the thrush to continue his task
of making the summer

this was in the morning but before midday the clouds gathered and the
sky darkened and at noon a cold rain began to drip the poor thrush
ceased his jubilant song and began to shiver in the march wind by night
the snow was felling thick and fast and where there had been a green
carpet on the earth was now spread a coverlet of snowy white shivering
and like to die of cold the thrush took refuge under the tree in the
moss and dead leaves the thought no more of his marriage nor of his
brothers but only of the danger which threatened him and of the
discomfort

the next morning christ and saint peter plodding through the
snow-drifts came upon him again and saint peter said as before i
wish you good day thrush

thank you answered the thrush humbly and his voice was shaky with
cold and sorrow

what do you here on the cold ground o thrush-who-make-the-summer and
why are you so sad asked saint peter and the thrush piped feebly

    to-day I must die I and no other
    to-morrow my brother

o foolish little bird said saint peter you boasted that you made
the summer but see the lords will has sent us back to the middle of
winter to punish your boasting you shall not die the will send the sun
again to warm you but hereafter beware how you take too much credit for
your little efforts

since that time march has ever been a treacherous and a changeful month
then the thrush thinks not of marriage but of his lesson learned in
past days and wraps himself in his warmest feathers waiting for the
lords will to be done the is no longer boastful in his song but sings
it humbly and sweetly to the lords glory thanking him for the summer
which his goodness sends every year to happy bird and beast and child of
man

                                   

now after this adventure with the thrush christ and saint peter went
upon their journey for many miles at last weary and hungry they
passed a bakers shop from the window came the smell of new warm bread
baking in the oven and christ sent saint peter to ask the baker for a
loaf but the baker who was a stingy fellow refused

go away with you the cried I give no bread to lazy beggars

I ask it for my master who has traveled many miles and is most faint
and weary said saint peter but the baker frowned and shook his head
then strode into the inner shop banging the door after him

the bakers wife and six daughters were standing at one side when these
things happened and they heard all that took place they were generous
and kind-hearted bodies and tears stood in their eyes at the bakers
rough words as soon as the had gone out they wrapped up the loaf and
gave it stealthily to saint peter saying

take the loaf for your master good man and may the be refreshed by
it

saint peter thanked and blessed them and took the loaf to christ and
for their charity the lord set these good women in the sky as the seven
starsyou may see them to this day shining in love upon the sleeping
world but the wicked baker the changed into a cuckoo and as long as he
sings his dreary song coo-coo coo-coo in the spring so long the
seven stars are visible in the heaven so folk say




the owl and the moon


when the moon is round and full if you look very carefully at the
golden disk you can see in shadowy outline the profile of a beautiful
lady she is leaning forward as if looking down upon our earth and
there is a little smile upon her sweet lips this fair dame is putri
balan the princess of the moon and she smiles because she remembers
how once upon a time she cheated old mr owl her tiresome lover

putrI balan so they tell you in malay was always very very beautiful
as we see her now like all the malay women putrI balan loved to chew
the spicy betel-nut which turns ones lips a bright scarlet it is
better so they say than any kind of candy and it is considered much
nicer and more respectable than chewing-gum so putrI balan was not
unladylike although she chewed her betel-nut all night long

now ever since the day when mr owl carelessly let the naughty little
wren escape from prison the shamed and sorry old fellow had never
dared to show his face abroad in daylight gradually his eyes grew
blurred and blinky till now the could not see anything by day even if
he were to try

so it happens that there are many delightful things about which old mr
owl does not knowthings which take place while the beautiful sun is
shining but also there are marvelous sights unknown to early-sleeping
birds which the enjoys all by himself for at night his queer eyes are
wonderfully strong and bright all day long the sits in his hollow tree
but when the other feathered folk are drowsing upon their roosts or are
snugly rolled up in their little nests with their heads tucked under
their downy wings old mr owl puts on his round spectacles and goes
a-prowling up and down the world through the woods and meadows like
haroun-al-rashid in the streets of bagdad spying all sorts of queer
doings

and this is how old mr owl happened to see the fair princess putri
balan smiling down from her moon upon the sleeping world of birds who
had never seen her and never would see her in all her loveliness

how beautiful she was how bright and wonderful old mr owl stared up
in wide-eyed astonishment and then and there fell in love with her
and resolved to ask her to be his wife

cramming on his spectacles more tightly and ruffling the feathers about
his neck the flew up and up and up as high as ever the dared to go
until the was within hailing distance of the moon then the called out in
his softest toneswhich were harsh enough to any ears

o fair moon-maiden o beautiful princess will you marry me for I love
you very dearly

the princess putrI balan stopped chewing her betel-nut for a moment and
looked down to see what daring creature might thus be addressing her
soon she spied mr owl with his goggle-eyes looking up at her adoringly
he was such a ridiculous old creature and his spectacles glinted so
queerly in the moonlight that putrI balan began to laugh and answered
him not at all she laughed so hard that she almost swallowed her
betel-nut which might have been a serious matter

mr owl continued to stare for the saw nothing funny in the situation
again the repeated in his hoarse voice o fair moon-maiden o beautiful
princess will you marry me for I love you very dearly

again the princess laughed for she thought it a tremendous joke and
again she nearly choked mr owl waited but she made him no other
answer however the was a persistent lover all night long the went on
asking the same question over and over again until the princess putri
balan was quite worn out trying not to choke with laughter while she
chewed the betel-nut at last she said impatiently

o mr goggle-eyes do give me a moments peace you make me laugh so
that I cannot chew my betel-nut yes I will say yes if you will only
leave me to finish my betel-nut undisturbed I will marry you but you
must go away until I have quite done

then mr owl was filled with joy thanks thanks o most gracious
lady the said I will go away and leave you to finish your betel-nut
undisturbed but I shall come again to-morrow night and by that time
you will have done with it and then you will be mine

mr owl flew back to his home in the hollow tree for it was almost
morning and already the was growing so blind that the could hardly find
the way but the princess putrI balan went on chewing the betel-nut and
to herself she said

illustration putrI balan began to laugh

how am I to rid myself of this bore I cannot chew this little
betel-nut forever there must be an end to it before long mr owl
will certainly come again to-morrow night and then according to my
promise I must become his wife I cannot marry old goggle-eyes oh
dear what shall I do

as she chewed her betel-nut the princess putrI balan hit upon a plan
she would manage to cheat old mr owl after all she would never finish
the betel-nut she took the little bit that remainedand it was a
dangerously little bit for the princess had been chewing all night
long except when she was laughingand reaching out from the moon she
tossed it down down down upon the earth at the same time she said a
magic moon-charm and when the bit of betel-nut reached the earth it
became a little birdthe same which the malay people call the honey
bird with brilliant beautiful plumage and the princess putrI balan
cried out to it from her golden house

fly away pretty little bright bird fly as far and as fast as ever you
can and keep out of mr owls way for it is you who must save me from
becoming his unhappy wife

so the honey bird flew away a brilliant streak through the malay
woods and hid himself in a little nest

when night came out stole mr owl with his spectacles in place and up
he flew to his princess whom the now hoped to call his very own

good evening my beautiful princess the cried have you finished your
betel-nut at last and are you ready to keep your promise

but the princess putrI balan looked down at him pretending to be sad
though there was a twinkle in her beautiful eye and she said

alas mr owl a dreadful thing has happened I lost my betel-nut
before it was quite finished it fell down down down until I think it
reached the earth and I cannot marry you according to my promise
until it is finished

then it must be found cried mr owl I will find it my eyes are
sharp at night and nothing escapes them shine kindly on me princess
and I will find the betel-nut for you and you shall yet be mine

go then mr owl said the princess smiling to herself go and look
for the betel-nut which I must finish before I marry you search
carefully and you may find it soon

poor mr owl searched carefully but the could not find the bit of
betel-nut of course the could not find it when it had changed and flown
away as a beautiful many-colored bird all that night the sought till
the sun sent him blinking to his tree and all the next night he
sought and the next and the next and the kept on seeking for days and
months and years while the princess putrI balan smiled down upon him
and was happy at heart because of her clever scheme

old mr owl never found out the trick nor suspected the innocent little
honey bird whom indeed the scarcely ever saw because it was a
sunset-sleeping bird while the was a wistful lonely sad night-prowler
up and down up and down the world the goes still looking for the
betel-nut of the princess putrI balan which the will never find and as
he flies in the moonlight the glances ever longingly at the beautiful
lady in the moon and sobs hoo-hoo hoo-hoo in grief and despair for
after all these centuries the begins to fear that she will never be his
wife




the tufted cap


one dark night master owl left his hollow tree and went prowling about
the world as usual upon his hopeless hunt for the princesss betel-nut
as soon as the was out of hearing a long lean hungry rat crept to the
house and stole the dainties which the lonely old bachelor had stored
away for the morrows dinner the thief dragged them away to his own
hole and had a splendid feast with his wife and little ones but the owl
returned sooner than the rat had expected and by the crumbs which he
had dropped upon the way tracked him to the hole

come out thief cried the owl or I will surely kill you come out
and return to me my morrows dinner the rat trembled with fear at
these threatening words

alas the squeaked I cannot do that for already the dinner is eaten
my wife and hungry little ones have eaten it pity us for we were
starving

bah screamed the owl I care little for that it is for my dinner
alone that I care since you have eaten it you shall certainly die and
he began to scratch fiercely at the mouth of the hole the rat trembled
more than ever but suddenly the had an idea which made his whiskers
twitch

hold the cried dear good master owl permit me to live and I will
give you something which is worth many dinners something that
men-creatures value very highly and which with great labor and pain i
brought away from one of their dens

umph grumbled the owl let us see what it is

the rat crawled timidly out of his hole with the peace-offering and
what do you think it was why a gimlet just a plain ordinary
well-sharpened gimlet for boring holes

hoo cried the owl I dont think much of that what is it good
for now the rat had not the faintest idea as to what the gimlet really
was but the had another idea instead

that whythatoh that that is a very valuable thing it is able
to give you the keenest delight I will show you how it works but you
must do just as I say or it will be of no use

hoo cried the owl continue with the directions

well first you must stick the thing point upwards in the ground at the
foot of this tree

very good said the owl doing as was suggested and waiting
expectantly for the next move

now you must mount to the top of the tree and slide down the trunk
said the rat solemnly old master owl was certainly very far from wise
that night for the obeyed the rats word without a suspicion the flew to
the top of the tree and then sitting back and giving a warning cry of
hoo-hoo coasted down the trunk with the speed of lightning but
midway down the struck a knot in the tree and rolled heels over head and
when the reached the ground of course the landed fast upon the sharp point
of the gimlet just as the rat had planned

with bloody head and hooting with pain the owl started off in pursuit
of the rat resolved this time to kill him without fail the rat was
nimble and his fear added to his speed but at last the owl caught him
ruffled and ferocious the great bird was about to tear him in pieces
when the rat once more begged his life

it was only a joke the cried only a silly joke spare me this once
dear master owl and I will give you something that you really need
look at your bleeding head you cannot go about the world with that
exposed spare my life and I will give you a lovely cap of tufted
feathers to hide the bite of the wicked sharp-thing-made-by-man pray
let me go dear master owl

the owl considered for a moment and then decided to accept the bargain
for the thought of putrI balan the princess of the moon and knew that
he should lose his last chance to win her if she happened to see him
with this ridiculous wound in his head

so the rat gave him a nice cap of tufted feathers which the wears to
this day and the owl let the thief go free but after that there was a
coolness between them as you may well imagine




the good hunter


once upon a time there was an indian who was a famous hunter but the did
not hunt for fun the took no pleasure in killing the little wild
creatures birds and beasts and fishes and did so only when it was
necessary for him to have food or skins for his clothing the was a very
kind and generous man and loved all the wood-creatures dearly often
feeding them from his own larder and protecting them from their
enemies so the animals and birds loved him as their best friend and he
was known as the good hunter

the good hunter was very brave and often went to war with the fierce
savages who were the enemies of his tribe one sad day the set forth with
a war party and they had a terrible battle in which the good hunter
was slain and his enemies took away his scalp leaving him lying dead
in the forest

the good hunter had not remained long cold and lifeless in the shadowy
stillness when the fox came trotting through the woods alack and
alas cried the fox spying the body stretched on the leaves here is
our dear friend the good hunter slain alack and alas what shall we
do now that our dear friend and protector is gone

the fox ran out into the forest crying the death lament which was the
signal to all the beasts that something most sorrowful had happened
soon they came flocking to the spot all the animals of the forest by
hundreds they came and surrounding the body of their friend raised the
most doleful howls for though they rubbed him with their warm noses
and licked him with their warm tongues and nestled against him with
their warm fur they could not bring him back to warm life

they called upon brother bear to speak and tell them what to do for he
was the nearest relative to man the bear sat up on his haunches and
spoke to the sad assembly with tears in his eyes begging each animal to
look carefully through his medicine-box and see whether there might not
be some balm which would restore the good hunter to life then each
animal looked carefully through his medicine-box of herbs and healing
roots bark and magic leaves and they tried every remedy that they
knew but nothing brought the color to their friends pale cheeks nor
light into his eyes the who had helped them so often was helpless now
and they could not aid him again the kind beasts sank back on their
haunches and raised a mighty howl a requiem for the dead

wild and piercing and long-drawn the sound swept through the forest
such a sound of sorrow as had never been heard before the oriole who
was flying overhead heard and was surprised soon his brightness came
flashing down through the leafy boughs like a ray of sunlight into the
gloom and darkness of the forest

what has happened o four-footed friends the asked that you mourn so
mightily then they showed him the body of the good hunter lying in the
midst of their sad company and the oriole joined his voice of sorrow to
theirs

o friend of the birds the cried is there no bird who can aid you
now you who have fed us so many times from the door of your generous
wigwam I will call all the feathered tribes and we will do our best

so the oriole went forth and summoned the birds to the forest council
there was a great flapping of wings a great twittering and chirping
questioning and exclamation when the birds assembled to hear the sad
news every one was there from the tiny humming bird to the great
eagle of the iroquois who left his lonely eyrie to pay his respects to
the good hunters memory the poor little birds tried everything in
their power to bring back to life their dear friend with beak and claw
and tender wing they strove but all their efforts were in vain their
good hunter was dead and his scalp was gone

then the great eagle whose head was white with years of wisdom and
experience spoke to the despairing assemblage of creatures from his
lofty perch above the world the eagle had looked down upon centuries of
change and decay the knew every force of nature and all the strange
things of life the hoary-headed sage said that the good hunter could
not be restored until his scalp was found then all the animals clamored
that they might be allowed to go and seek for the missing scalp but to
the fox was given this honor because the had first found the body of the
good hunter in the forest the fox set out upon his search in his foxy
way the visited every hen-roost and every birds-nest but no scalp did
he find of course not screamed the birds when the returned from his
fruitless quest of course no bird has taken the good hunters scalp
you should have known better than that master fox

so the next time a bird was sent upon the search the pigeon hawk went
forth confident that she should be successful but she was in such a
hurry and flew so fast that she saw nothing and she too returned
without that for which she sought then the white heron begged that he
might be allowed to try for said the you all know how slowly I fly
and how careful I am to see everything

yes especially if it be something good to eat chirped the saucy jay
do not trust him birds the is too greedy

yet the heron was allowed to go the flapped away slowly and sedately
and the council sat down to await his return but the heron had not gone
far when the came to a field of luscious wild beans and the stopped to
take a mouthful or two the ate and the ate and the ate the greedy
fellow until the could eat no more and then the was sleepy so that he
slept and slept and slept and when the awoke the was so hungry that he
fell to eating again while the council waited and wondered and waited
at last they grew impatient and began to suspect that the jay had been
right which was indeed the case they decided to wait no longer for the
heron who did not return then the crow stepped forward and said let
me go I pray you for I think I know where the scalp may be found not
in the nest of a bird not in the den of any animal not in the watery
haunt of a fish for all the creatures of earth air and water are
friends of the good hunter it is men who are most cruel to men
therefore in the tents of men must we look for the missing scalp let me
go to seek it there for men are used to see me flying near and will not
suspect why I come

the crow flew forth upon his errand and before long came to the wigwam
where lived the warrior who had slain the good hunter and sure enough
there outside the tent was the scalp of the good hunter stretched on
a pole to dry the crow flew near and the warrior saw him but thought
nothing of it for the was used to seeing crows about the camp presently
when no one was looking the skillful thief managed to steal the scalp
and away the flew with it to the council in the forest great was the
rejoicing of the birds and beasts when they saw that the crow had been
successful and they said more kind things to him than the had heard for
many moons at once they put the scalp upon the good hunters head but
it had grown so dry in the smoke of the warriors wigwam that it would
not fit here was a new trouble what was to be done to make the scalp
soft and flexible once more the animals did their best but their
efforts were of no avail

once more the great eagle came forward and bade them listen

my children the said my wings are never furled night and day for
hundreds of years the dews of heaven have been collecting upon my back
as I sit on my throne above the clouds perhaps this dew may have a
healing power such as no earthly fountain holds we will see

gravely the eagle plucked a long feather and dipping it in the dew
which moistened his plumage applied it to the stiffened scalp
immediately it became soft and could be fitted to the head of the good
hunter closely as when it had first grown there the birds and animals
hurried away and brought leaves and flowers bark and berries and roots
which they made into a mighty healing balsam to bathe the poor head
which had been so cruelly treated and presently great was their joy to
see a soft color come into the pale cheeks of the good hunter and light
into his eyes the breathed the stirred the sat up and looked around him
in surprise

where am I what has happened the asked

you slept and your friends have wakened you said the great eagle
tenderly stand up good hunter that they may see you walk once more

the good hunter stood up and walked rather unsteadily at first back to
his own wigwam followed by a great company of happy forest creatures
who made the sky ring with their noises of rejoicing and long long
after that the good hunter lived to love and protect them




the courtship of mr stork and miss heron


this is a very good story to read at night just before going to sleep
and if you ask why I must only tell you that you will find out before
you reach the end of the tale

                                   

there was once a heron a pretty long-legged slender lady heron who
lived in the mushy-squshy wady-shady swamp the lady heron lived in her
swamp all alone earning her living by catching little fish and she was
very happy never dreaming that she was lonesome for no one had told
her what lonesome was she loved to go wading in the cool waters she
loved to catch the little fish who swam by unsuspectingly while she
stood still upon one leg pretending to think about something a thousand
miles away and she loved to look at her slender long-legged blue
reflection in the water for the lady heron was just a little bit vain

now one day mr stork came flying over the mushy-squshy wady-shady
swamp where the heron lived and the too saw the reflection in the water
and the said to himself my how pretty she is I wonder I never noticed
her before and how lonesome she must be there all by herself in such a
nasty moist mushy-squshy old swamp I will invite her to come and
share my nice warm dry nest on the chimney-top for to tell the truth
I am growing lonely up there all by myself why should we not make a
match of it we two long-legged creatures

mr stork went home to his house which the set prettily in order for he
never dreamed but that the lady heron would accept his offer at the very
first croak the preened his feathers and made himself as lovely as he
could and forthwith off the flew with his long legs dangling straight
to the wady-shady swamp where miss heron was standing on one leg waiting
for her supper to get itself caught

ahem croaked mr stork waving his wing politely good evening miss
heron fine weather we are having eh but how horribly moist it is down
here I should think that your nice straight legs would grow crooked
with rheumatism now I have a comfortable dry house on the roof

pouf grunted miss heron disdainfully

but mr stork pretended not to hear and went on with his remarksa
nice dry house which I should be glad to have you share with me come
miss heron here I am a lonely old bachelor and here are you a lonely
old maid

lonely old maid indeed screamed the heron interrupting him I dont
know what it is to be lonely go along with you and she splashed water
on him with her wings she was so indignant

poor mr stork felt very crestfallen at this reception of his
well-meaning invitation the turned about and stalked away towards his
nest upon the roof without so much as saying good-by to the lady

but no sooner was the out of sight than miss heron began to think the had
said that she was lonely was she lonely well perhaps the ought to know
better than she for the was a very wise bird perhaps she was lonely
now that she came to think of it however there was no reason why she
should go to live in that stupid dry old nest on the house-top why
could the not come to dwell in her lovely mushy-squshy wady-shady
swamp that would be very pleasant for the was a good sort of fellow
with nice long legs and there were fish enough in the water for two
besides the could then do the fishing for the family and moreover
there would then be two to admire her reflection in the water yes her
mind was made up she would invite him she glanced down at her
reflection and settled some of the feathers which her fit of temper had
ruffled out of order then off she started in pursuit of mr stork

mr stork had not gone very far for a sad rejected lover is a dawdling
creature and so she came up with him long before the was in sight of his
nest

good evening mr stork said the lady nervously iI have been
thinking over what you said to me just now and I have concluded that
perhaps I was a bit hasty to tell you the truth sir I am a trifle
lonely now that you suggest the thought to me and it would be very
agreeable to have pleasant company I am ready sir to agree to your
proposal but of course I cannot think of changing my abode my swamp is
the most beautiful home that a maiden ever knew and I could not give it
up for any one as for your ugly old nest on the chimney-top bah i
cannot endure the idea with patience

mr stork was gradually stiffening into an angry attitude but she did
not notice now you can come and live in my swamp miss heron went on
warmly and you will be very welcome to catch fish for me and to look
in my mirror it will be very nice indeed

nice croaked the stork I should say as much what can you be
thinking of miss I to give up my comfortable home on the house-top
close by the warm chimney and go to live in that disgusting
mushy-squshy bog of yours ha-ha that is really too ridiculous I bid
you good morning and with an elaborate bow the turned his back and flew
away

miss heron flounced back to her swamp mortified because she had left it
to propose terms to so ungallant a fellow but hardly had she begun her
tardy supper when once more mr storks shadow darkened the mirror
before her and once more she heard his apologetic croak

ahem ahem the began I hope I find you well miss heron I have
beenha humconsidering your last most condescending words and i
find that I have been hasty you are so good as to express a belief that
I should make a pleasant companion so I should so I should and as for
you the bowed gallantly one can readily imagine the charm of your
society come then miss heron why should we not make a happy couple
if we can only arrange this one little foolish matter be my wife come
live with me in my lovely nest

but at this word miss heron uttered a little scream and cried be off
with you you villain leave my premises instantly and she waved her
wings so fiercely that once more mr stork took to his and flapped away
to his home

now when the had gone miss heron found that she had been bad-tempered
and she thought how pleasantly they might have arranged the matter if
only she had been more moderate so she spread her beautiful blue wings
and flew to the housetop where mr stork lived and perching on the
chimney she said

oh mr stork I was bad-tempered and impolite and I beg your pardon
let us be friends once more leave this hot old stupid house-top and
come live in my cool moist wady-shady swamp and I will be your very
loving little wife

but the stork arose in his nest flapping his wings crossly and cried
be off you baggage dont come here to insult my beautiful house be
off I say to your mushy-squshy rheumaticky bog I want no more of
you

so the heron flew back disconsolately to the watery swamp where she
began to feel very lonely indeed and the stork too began to feel very
lonely indeed and the was sorry that the had been rude to a lady
presently once more the came flapping to the mushy-squshy marsh where
he found miss heron just ready to go to sleep

oh dear miss heron the cried I made a great mistake and said
things for which I am truly sorry do come to be my loving wife as you
promised and we will live happily ever after on the chimney-top far
above the other birds and I will never be cross again

but the heron answered away with you I want to go to sleep I am
tired of your croaking voice leave me alone so the stork flew away in
a huff

but the heron could not sleep she was so lonely so she rose and
flying through the still night air came again to the storks high-built
nest

come storkie dear she said in her sweetest tone come home to your
dear wifes house in the wady-shady mushy-squshy marsh and I will be
good

but the stork pretended to be asleep and only snored in reply so the
heron flew home in a huff but the stork could not truly sleep the was
so lonely so the rose and flying through the still night air came
again to the herons home in the marsh

come my dear the said come home to your dear husbands house and i
will be good

but the heron made no answer pretending to be asleep so the stork flew
home in a huff but the heron could not truly sleep she was so lonely
so she rose at break of day and flying through the cool morning air
came again to the storks nest

come storkie dear she said come home to your dear wifes house
and I will be good

but the stork did not answer the was so angry so the heron flew home in
a huff

                                   

and if you are not asleep when you get as far as this you may go on
with the story by yourself perfectly well you may go on just as long
as you can keep awake for the tale has no end no end at all it is
still going on to this very day the stork still lives lonely on his
house-top and the heron still lives lonely in her marsh growing
lonelier and lonelier both of them but because they have no tact they
are never able to agree to the same thing at the same time and they
keep flying back and forth saying the same things over and over and
over and over




the phoenix


on the top of a palm tree in an oasis of the arabian desert sat the
phoenix glowering moodily upon the world below the was alone quite
alone in his old age as the had been alone in his youth and in his
middle years for the phoenix has neither mate nor children and there
is never but one of his kind upon the earth

once the had been proud of his solitariness and of his unusual beauty
which caused such wonder when the went abroad but now the was old and
weak and weary and the was lonely oh so lonely the had lived too long
he thought

for years and years and years afar and apart the had watched the coming
and going of things in the world the had seen the other birds created
and had watched them undergo strange changes in form and color until
they became as they are to-day the had seen the hundred bright eyes of
argus the watchman set in the peacocks tail the had seen the flaming
heart of the volcano tamed and quieted until it became the flaming
little humming-bird the had seen the crow turn black and the goldfinch
become a gaudy bird and the knew how and why all these things had come
to pass for centuries how many the knew not the had watched the birds
hatch out of their little eggs flutter their feeble little wings fly
away to build nests for their little mates and finally die and
disappear as birds do leaving no trace behind

but the phoenix did not die the was of different clay from these
ordinary feathered creatures the was the glorious bird of the sun the
only one the gold-and-crimson one who when the went abroad filled all
creatures with awe of his beauty and wisdom and mystery so that they
dared not come near but followed him afar off hushing their song and
adoring silently the phoenix fed not on flowers or fruit or
disgusting insect-fry but on precious frankincense and myrrh and
odoriferous gums and the sun himself loved to caress his plumage of
gold and crimson

as for men they also had adored him in time past and had built temples
in his honor they also were puny mortals scarcely longer of life than
the birds themselves the phoenix had seen many generations of men
grow up do good or evil deeds and die sometimes leaving grand
monuments upon the earth sometimes disappearing from knowledge like
the very birds leaving scarcely a trace behind

in his time great kings had lived and reigned and turned to dust
prophets had grown hoary said their word and passed away leaving no
echo poets had sung and had died singing but the phoenix looking
down from the palms of his desert saw it all and did not die

all this had been his pride and honor how the had enjoyed his strength
his beauty his wisdom and the knowledge that the was honored and adored
by thousands who had never even seen his glory but now now all was
changed the was grown old and tired the felt his loneliness and he
longed to die

his wings were feeble of late the had not dared to venture far from the
desert the dreaded the curious gaze of the other birds who would find
his beauty dimmed and would scorn perchance the faded glory which
they had once held in awe for years the had not ventured within sight of
men and the knew that most of them had forgotten his existence nay
even denied that the had ever lived the feared that there might not be a
single heart in all the world that thrilled to his name

thinking thus mournfully the phoenix sat upon the top of the tallest
palm his plumage of crimson and gold glowed in the last rays of the
setting sun his head was drooping and his eye lustreless the joy of
life was gone slowly the sun sank towards the horizon a red eye fixed
upon the phoenix steadily suddenly across the gray waste of sand
dotted a beam of light intensely bright a single ray from that
watchful eye seemed to flame as it reached the palm tree and pierced to
the very heart of the phoenix a thrill ran through his body the drew
himself together and his eye gleamed with new lustre as the fixed it
steadily upon the dazzling disk just touching the horizon dark stood
the palm against the desert but the phoenix was bathed in sudden
light it was the signal the signal for which the had been waiting
though the knew it not the five hundred years were ended the mystery of
his life was about to be solved

as the sun sank below the horizon eagerly the phoenix set about the
task which was before him at last the might build the nest which till
now the had never known on the top of the highest palm the would build
it that it might receive from the blessed east the first beam of the
morning sun marvelously strengthened for the task back and forth to
the ends of the earth his wings of crimson and gold bore the phoenix
that night for this was to be no nest of sticks and straw of precious
things must it be made and well the knew where such were to be found of
silky leaves and grass interwoven with splinters of sandal-wood were the
walls then on the bottom of the nest the laid bit by bit a pile of
sweet-smelling gums cinnamon and spice spikenard myrrh camphor
ambergris and frankincense with no meaner choice

all night the labored beak and talon until the nest was ready and as
the first tints of dawn began to streak the east the phoenix rose
once high into the air gazing with wistful eyes over the world which
he had loved then slowly sinking to the palm the poised his gorgeous
body upon the fragrant nest with wings spread wide and eyes fixed
eagerly upon the spot where the sun was sure to rise the waited waited

at last the golden eye appeared as on the night before one radiant
beam seemed to single out the lonely palm one shaft of flame pierced to
the nest whereon the phoenix sat it was the final signal to the bird
of the sun immediately the great bird began to fan the sweet-smelling
mass with his wings the burning ray grew brightera pungent
wonderful aroma of mingled fragrances filled the air gradually the sun
rose great and glorious and as it advanced into the heaven a thin
cloud of smoke floated from the palm tree and wound away across the
desert towards the east faster and faster fanned the great wings of the
phoenix until when the sun shone full down through the palm tree top
the whole mass burst into flame in the midst of which the phoenix
blended crimson and gold high in the air rose the fire diffusing
abroad all the sweet odors of araby the blest for a little while it
glowed then gradually sank lower and lower until but a pile of ashes
remained at the bottom of the nest

but lo was the phoenix dead what was this creature risen in youth
and beauty from the ashes a bird like the eagle in shape but nobler
larger stronger more gracious even than the king of birds a brilliant
vision of crimson and gold rose like a flame from the nest hung for a
moment above the palm looking eagerly at the sun which baptized him in
its splendor a new phoenix lived in the world once more the ancient
glory was renewed once more youth joy and hope sprang from the
phoenixs ashes and rejoiced in the centuries of sunshine before him
death was indeed worth dying to make this life worth living

slowly the young phoenix descended to the nest which had been at once
a sepulchre and a cradle tenderly careful of the parent ashes which it
held with lusty beak and talon the tore the nest bodily from the
branches and set out upon his pious journey the knew not where the went
nor why but the sun drew him to the east

as the sped through the sky a flash of gold and crimson the lesser
birds gathered to wonder and admire flocks of them followed at a
distance a train of worshipers chorusing the glory of the new-born
wonder the bore his head high with its burden and his heart was filled
with pious joy it was good to be a phoenix good good

at last the reached the place which unknowingly the sought the sun alone
had been his guide to the city of heliopolis in egypt the came to the
great temple of the sun brightly adorned with crimson and gold the
phoenix colors

there upon the altar the laid the precious ashes and lo there were folk
waiting to receive them many little children and some elders of
childlike heart who took the ashes and laid them reverently in the
shrine the phoenix was not forgotten the was never to be forgotten so
long as the world should last

the new phoenix flew back to the arabian desert to live his five
hundred years as each of his race had done sacred afar and apart but
not forgotten though in his old age the might come to deem so for in
the bright temple of the sun there are always folk of childlike sympathy
who delight to honor the eternal phoenix of romance and mystery the
dear undying memory of a time long past

the pheasant


as birds are to be considered throughout these pages from any standpoint
but that of sport much that is of interest in connection with a bird
essentially the sportsmans must necessarily be omitted at the same
time although this gorgeous creature the chief attraction of social
gatherings throughout the winter months appeals chiefly to the men who
shoot and eat it it is not uninteresting to the naturalist with
opportunities for studying its habits under conditions more favourable
than those encountered when in pursuit of it with a gun

in the first place with the probable exception of the swan of which
something is said on a later page the pheasant stands alone among the
birds of our woodlands in its personal interest for the historian it is
not in fact a british bird save by acclimatisation at all and is
generally regarded as a legacy of the romans the time and manner of its
introduction into britain are it is true veiled in obscurity what we
know on authentic evidence is that the bird was officially recognised
in the reign of harold and that it had already come under the ægis of
the game laws in that of henry I during the first year of which the
abbot of amesbury held a licence to kill it though how the contrived
this without a gun is not set forth in detail probably it was first
treed with the aid of dogs and then shot with bow and arrow the
original pheasant brought over by the romans or by whomsoever may have
been responsible for its naturalisation on english soil was a
dark-coloured bird and not the type more familiar nowadays since its
frequent crosses with other species from the far east as well as with
several ornamental types of yet more recent introduction

in tabooing the standpoint of sport wherever possible from these
chapters occasional reference where it overlaps the interests of the
field-naturalist is inevitable thus there are two matters in which
both classes are equally concerned when considering the pheasant the
first is the real or alleged incompatibility of pheasants and foxes in
the same wood the question of rivalry between pheasant and fox or as
I rather suspect between those who shoot the one and hunt the other
admits of only one answer the fox eats the pheasant the pheasant is
eaten by the fox this not very complex proposition may read like an
excerpt from a french grammar but it is the epitome of the whole
argument it is just possible we have no actual evidence to go on that
under such wholly natural conditions as survive nowhere in rural england
the two might flourish side by side the fox taking occasional toll of
its agreeably flavoured neighbours and the latter we may suppose
their wits sharpened by adversity gradually devising means of keeping
out of the robbers reach in the artificial environment of a hunting or
shooting country however the fox will always prove too much for a bird
dulled by much protection and the only possible _modus vivendi_ between
those concerned must rest on a policy of give and take that deliberately
ignores the facts of the case

more interesting on academic grounds at any rate is the process of
education noticeable in pheasants in parts of the country where they
are regularly shot sport is a great educator foxes certainly and
hares probably run the faster for being hunted indeed the fox appears
to have acquired its pace solely as the result of the chase since it
does not figure in the bible as a swift creature the genuine wild
pheasant in its native region a little beyond the caucasus is in all
probability a very different bird from its half-domesticated kinsman in
britain I have been close to its birthplace but never even saw a
pheasant there we are told on what ground I have been unable to trace
that the polygamous habit in these birds is a product of artificial
environment but what is even more likely is that the true wild pheasant
of western asia and not the acclimatised bird so-called in this
country trusts much less to its legs than our birds which have long
since learnt that there is safety in running moreover though it
probably takes wing more readily it is doubtful whether it flies as
fast as the pace something a little short of forty miles an hour that
has been estimated as a common performance in driven birds at home

the pheasant is in many respects a very curious bird at the threshold
of life it exhibits in common with some of its near relations a
precocity very unusual in its class and the readiness with which
pheasant chicks only just out of the egg run about and forage for
themselves is astonishing to those unused to it another interesting
feature about pheasants is the extraordinary difference in plumage
between the sexes a gap equalled only between the blackcock and greyhen
and quite unknown in the partridge quail and grouse yet every now and
again as if resentful of this inequality of wardrobe an old hen
pheasant will assume male plumage and this epicene raiment indicates
barrenness ungallant feminists have been known to cite the case of the
mule pheasant as pointing a moral for the females of a more highly
organised animal

the question of the pheasants natural diet more particularly where
this is not liberally supplemented from artificial sources brings the
sportsman in conflict with the farmer and a demagogue whose zeal
occasionally outruns his discretion has even endeavoured to cite the
mangold as its staple food this however is political and not natural
history although however like all grain-eating birds the pheasant is
no doubt capable of inflicting appreciable damage on cultivated land it
seems to be established beyond all question that it also feeds greedily
on the even more destructive larva of the crane-fly in which case it
may more than pay its footing in the fields the foodstuff most fatal to
itself is the yew leaf for which often with fatal results it seems to
have an unconquerable craving the worst disease however from which
the pheasant suffers is gapes caused by an accumulation of small red
worms in the windpipe that all but suffocate the victim

reference has been made to the birds great speed in the air as well as
to its efficiency as a runner it remains only to add that it is also a
creditable swimmer and has been seen to take to water when escaping from
its enemies

the polygamous habit has been mentioned ten or twelve eggs or more
are laid in the simple nest of leaves and this is generally placed on
the ground but occasionally in a low tree or hedge or even in the
disused nest of some other bird

comparatively few of the birds referred to in the following pages appeal
strongly to the epicure but the pheasant if not perhaps the most
esteemed of them is at least a wholesome table bird it should
however always be eaten with chip potatoes and bread sauce and not in
the company of cold lettuce those who insist on the english method of
serving it should quote the learned freeman who when confronted with
the continental alternative complained bitterly that the was not a
silkworm

the woodcock




the woodcock


there are many reasons why the woodcock should be prized by the winter
sportsman more than any other bird in the bag in the first place there
is its scarcity half a dozen to every hundred pheasants would in most
parts of the country be considered a proportion at which none could
grumble and there are many days on which not one is either seen or
shot again there is the birds twisting flight which particularly
inside the covert makes it anything but an easy target third and last
it is better to eat than any other of our wild birds with the possible
exception of the golden plover taking one consideration with another
then it is not surprising that the first warning cry of woodcock
over from the beaters should be the signal for a sharp and somewhat
erratic fusillade along the line a salvo which the beaters themselves
usually honour by crouching out of harms way since they know from
experience that even ordinarily cool and collected shots are sometimes
apt to be fired with a sudden zeal to shoot the little bird which may
cost one of them his eyesight according to the poet

    lonely woodcocks haunt the watery glade

and so no doubt they do at meal-time after sunset but we are more used
to flushing them amid dry bracken or in the course of some frozen ditch
quite apart however from its exhilarating effect on the sportsman the
bird has quieter interests for the naturalist since in its food its
breeding habits its travels and its appearance it combines more
peculiarities than perhaps any other bird certainly than any other of
the sportsmans birds in these islands it is not legally speaking a
game bird and was not included in the act of  but a game licence is
required for shooting it and it enjoys since  the protection
accorded to other wild birds this is excellent so far as it goes but
it ought to be protected during the same period as the pheasant
particularly now that it is once more established as a resident species
all over britain and ireland

this new epoch in the history of its adventures in these islands is the
work of the wild birds protection acts in olden times when half of
britain was under forest and when guns were not yet invented that could
shoot flying woodcocks must have been much more plentiful than they
are to-day in those times the bird was taken on the ground in springes
or when roding in the mating season in nets known as shots that
were hung between the trees when the forest area receded the resident
birds must have dwindled to the verge of extinction for on more than
one occasion we find even a seasoned sportsman like colonel hawker
worked up to a rare pitch of excitement after shooting woodcock in a
part of hampshire where in our day these birds breed regularly thanks
however to the protection afforded by the law there is once again
probably no county in england in which woodcocks do not nest

at the same time it is as an autumn visitor that with the first of the
east wind in october or november we look for this untiring little
traveller from the continent some people are of opinion that since it
has extended its residential range fewer come oversea to swell the
numbers but the arrivals are in some years considerable and if a
stricter watch were kept on unlicensed gunners along the foreshore of
east anglia very much larger numbers would find their way westwards
instead of to leadenhall as it is the wanderers arrive not
necessarily as has been freely asserted in poor condition but always
tired out by their journey and numbers are secured before they have
time to recover their strength yet those which do recover fly right
across england some continuing the journey to ireland and stragglers
even with help no doubt from easterly gales having been known to reach
america

the woodcock is interesting as a parent because it is one of the very
few birds that carry their young from place to place and the only
british bird that transports them clasped between her legs a few
others like the swans and grebes bear the young ones on the back but
the woodcocks method is unique scopolI first drew attention to his own
version of the habit in the words _pullos rostro portat_ and it was
old gilbert white who with his usual eye to the practical doubted
whether so long and slender a bill could be turned to such a purpose
more recent observation has confirmed whites objection and has
established the fact of the woodcock holding the young one between her
thighs the beak being apparently used to steady her burden whether the
little ones are habitually carried about in this fashion or merely on
occasion of danger is not known and indeed the birds preference for
activity in the dusk has invested accurate observation of its habits
with some difficulty among well-known sportsmen who were actually so
fortunate as to have witnessed this interesting performance passing
mention may be made of the late duke of beaufort the hon grantley
berkeley and sir ralph payne-gallwey

reference has already been made to the now obsolete use of nets for the
capture of these birds when roding the cock-shuts as they were
called were spread so as to do their work after sundown and this is
the meaning of shakespeares allusion to cock-shut time this roding
is a curious performance on the part of the males only and it bears
some analogy to the drumming of snipe it is accompanied indeed by the
same vibrating noise which may be produced from the throat as well
but is more probably made only by the beating of the wings there
appears to be some divergence of opinion as to its origin in both birds
though in that of the snipe such sound authorities as messrs abel
chapman and harting are convinced that it proceeds from the quivering of
the primaries as the large quill-feathers of the wings are called
other naturalists however have preferred to associate it with the
spreading tail-feathers whether these eccentric gymnastics are
performed as displays with a view to impressing admiring females or
whether they are merely the result of excitement at the pairing season
cannot be determined it is safe to assume that they aim at one or other
of these objects and further no one can go with any certainty the word
roding is spelt roading by newton who thus gives the preference to
the anglo-saxon description of the aërial tracks followed by the bird
over the alternative derivation from the french roder which means to
wander the flight is at any rate wholly different from that to which
the sportsman is accustomed when one of these birds is flushed in
covert in the latter case either instinct or experience seems to have
taught it extraordinary tricks of zigzag manoeuvring that not seldom
save its life from a long line of over-anxious guns though out in the
open where it generally flies in a straight line for the nearest
covert few birds of its size are easier to bring down fortunately we
do not in england shoot the bird in springtime the season of roding
but the practice is in vogue in the evening twilight in every
continental country and large bags are made in this fashion

in its hungry moments the woodcock like the snipe has at once the
advantages and handicap of so long a beak on hard ground in a long
spell of either drought or frost it must come within measurable
distance of starvation for its only manner of procuring its food in
normal surroundings is to thrust its bill deep into the soft mud in
search of earthworms the bird does not it is true as was once
commonly believed live by suction or as the irish peasants say in
some parts on water but such a mistake might well be excused in anyone
who had watched the birds manner of digging for its food in the ooze
the long bill is exceedingly sensitive at the tip and in all
probability by the aid of a tactile sense more highly developed than
any other in our acquaintance this organ conveys to its owner the
whereabouts of worms wriggling silently down out of harms way on first
reaching britain the woodcock remains for a few days on the seashore to
recover from its crossing and at this time of rest it trips over the
wet sand generally in the gloaming and picks up shrimps and such other
soft food as is uncovered between tidal marks it is not among the
easiest of birds to keep for any length of time in captivity but if due
attention be paid to its somewhat difficult requirements in the way of
suitable food success is not unattainable on the whole bread and milk
has been found the best artificial substitute for its natural diet with
the _kiwi_ of new zealand a bird not even distantly related to the
woodcock and a cousin rather of the ostrich but equipped with much the
same kind of bill as the subject of these remarks an even closer
imitation of the natural food has been found possible in menageries
the bill of the _kiwi_ which has the nostrils close to the tip is even
more sensitive than that of the woodcock and is employed in very similar
fashion at regents park the keeper supplies the bird with fresh worms
so long as the ground is soft enough for spade-work they are left in a
pan and the _kiwi_ eats them during the night in winter however when
worms are not only hard to come by in sufficient quantity but also
frost-bitten and in poor condition an efficient substitute is found in
shredded fillet steak which whether it accepts it for worms or not
the new zealander devours with the same relish

when a woodcock lies motionless among dead leaves it is one of the most
striking illustrations of protective colouring to be found anywhere
time and again the sportsman all but treads on one which is betrayed
only by its large bright eye there are men who in their eagerness to
add it to the bag do not hesitate in such circumstances to shoot a
woodcock on the ground but a man so fond of ground game should
certainly be refused a game licence and should be allowed to shoot
nothing but rabbits




march

the woodpigeon




the woodpigeon


the woodpigeon is many things to many men to the farmer who has some
claim to priority of verdict it is a curse even as the rabbit in
australia the lemming in norway or the locust in algeria the tiller
of the soil whose business brings him in open competition with the
natural appetites of such voracious birds beasts or insects regards
his rivals from a standpoint which has no room for sentiment and the
woodpigeons are to our farmers particularly in the well-wooded
districts of the west country even as carthage was to cato the censor
something to be destroyed

it is this attitude of the farmer which makes the woodpigeon
pre-eminently the bird of february all through the shooting season just
ended a high pigeon has proved an irresistible temptation to the guns
whether cleaving the sky above the tree-tops doubling behind a broad
elm or suddenly swinging out of a gaunt fir yet it is in february
when other shooting is at an end and the coverts no longer echo the
fusillade of the past four months that the farmers furious at the
sight of green root-crops grazed as close as by sheep and of young
clover dug up over every acre of their tilling welcome the co-operation
of sportsmen glad to use up the balance of their cartridges in organised
pigeon battues these gatherings have during the past five years
become an annual function in parts of devonshire and the neighbouring
counties and if the bag is somewhat small in proportion to the guns
engaged a wholesome spirit of sport informs those who take part and
there is a curiously utilitarian atmosphere about the proceedings
everyone seems conscious that in place of the usual idle pleasure of
the covert-side or among the turnips the is out for a purpose not
merely killing birds that have been reared to make his holiday but
actually helping the farmers in their fight against nature as
moreover recent scares of an epidemic not unlike diphtheria have
precluded the use of the birds for table purposes the powder is burnt
with no thought of the pot

the usual plan is to divide the guns in small parties and to post these
in neighbouring plantations or lining hedges overlooking these spinneys
at a given signal the firing commences and is kept up for several hours
a number of the marauders being killed and the rest so harried that many
of them must leave the neighbourhood only to find a similar warm
welcome across the border some such concerted attack has of late years
been rendered necessary by the great increase in the winter invasion
from overseas it is probable that as most writers on the subject
insist the wanderings of these birds are for the most part restricted
to these islands and are mere food forays like those which cause
locusts to desert a district that they have stripped bare for pastures
new at the same time it seems to be beyond all doubt the fact that
huge flocks of woodpigeons reach our shores annually from scandinavia
and their inroads have had such serious results that it is only by joint
action that their numbers can be kept under for such work february is
obviously the month not only because most of their damage to the
growing crops and seeds is accomplished at this season but also
because large numbers of gunners no longer able to shoot game are thus
at the disposal of the farmers and only too glad to prolong their
shooting for a few weeks to such good purpose

many birds are greedy the cormorant has a higher reputation of the sort
to live up to than even the hog and some of the hornbills though less
familiar are endowed with gargantuan appetites yet the ringdove could
probably vie with any of them mr harting mentions having found in the
crop of one of these birds thirty-three acorns and forty-four
beech-nuts while no fewer than  of the latter were taken together
with other food remains from another it is no uncommon experience to
see the crop of a woodpigeon that is brought down from a great height
burst on reaching the earth with a report like that of a pistol and
scatter its undigested contents broadcast little wonder then that the
farmers welcome the slaughter of so formidable a competitor it is one
of their biggest customers and pays nothing for their produce one told
me not long ago that the woodpigeons had got at a little patch of
young rape only a few acres in all which had been uncovered by the
drifting snow and had laid it as bare as if the earth had never been
planted seeing what hearty meals the woodpigeon makes it is not
surprising that it should sometimes throw up pellets of undigested
material this is not however a regular habit as in the case of hawks
and owls and is rather perhaps the result of some abnormally
irritating food

pigeons digest their food with the aid of a secretion in the crop and
it is on this soft material popularly known as pigeons milk that
they feed their nestlings this method suggests analogy to that of the
petrels which rear their young on fish-oil partly digested after the
same fashion indeed all the pigeons are devoted parents though the
majority build only a very pretentious platform of sticks for the two
eggs they sit very close and feed the young ones untiringly some of
the pigeons of australia indeed go even further not only do they
build a much more substantial nest of leafy twigs but the male bird
actually sits throughout the day such paternal sense of duty being all
the more remarkable from the fact that these pigeons of the antipodes
usually lay but a single egg australia with the neighbouring islands
must be a perfect paradise for pigeons since about half of the species
known to science occur in that region only the wonga-wonga and
bronze-wing and great fruit-pigeons are like the bald-pates of
jamaica all favourite birds with sportsmen and some of the birds are
far more brightly coloured than ours it is however noticeable that
even the gayest queensland species with wings shot with every prismatic
hue are dull-looking birds seen from above and the late dr a r
wallace regarded this as affording protection against keen-eyed hawks on
the forage his ingenious theory receives support from the well-known
fact that in many of the islands where pigeons are even more plentiful
but where also hawks are few the former wear bright clothes on their
back as well

the woodpigeon has many names in rural england that by which it is
referred to in the foregoing notes is not perhaps the most
satisfactory since with the possible exception of the smaller
stock-dove which lays its eggs in rabbit burrows and the rock-dove
which nests in the cliffs all the members of the family need trees if
only to roost and nest in a more descriptive name is that of ringdove
easily explained by the white collar but the bird is also known as
cushat queest or even culver the last-named however which will be
familiar to readers of tennyson probably alludes specifically to the
rock-dove as it undoubtedly gave its name to culver cliff a prominent
landmark in the isle of wight where these birds have at all times been
sparingly in evidence

the ringdove occasionally rears a nestling in captivity but it does not
seem at any time of life to prove a very attractive pet white found
it strangely ferocious and another writer describes it as listless and
uninteresting the only notable success on record is that scored by st
john who set some of the eggs under a tame pigeon and secured one
survivor that appears to have grown quite tame but was unfortunately
eaten by a hawk at any rate it did its kind good service by enlisting
on their side the pen of the most ardent apologist they have ever had
indeed st john did not hesitate to rate the farmers soundly for
persecuting the bird in wilful ignorance of its unpaid services in
clearing their ground of noxious weeds yet however true his eloquent
plea may have been in respect of his native lothian there would be some
difficulty in persuading south country agriculturists of the
woodpigeons hidden virtues to those however who do not sow that they
may reap the subject of these remarks has irresistible charm there is
doubtless monotony in its cooing yet heard in a still plantation of
firs with no other sound than perhaps the distant call of a shepherd or
barking of a farm dog it is a music singularly in harmony with the
peaceful scene the arrowy flight of these birds when they come in from
the fields at sundown and fall like rushing waters on the tree-tops is
an even more memorable sound to the sportsman above all the
woodpigeon shows itself a splendid bird of freedom more cunning than
any hand-reared game bird swifter on the wing than any other purely
wild bird a welcome addition to the bag because it is hard to shoot in
the open and because in life it was a sore trial to a class already
harassed with their share of this lifes troubles




april

birds in the high hall garden




birds in the high hall garden


all march the rooks were busy in the swaying elms but it is these
softer evenings of april when the first young leaves are beginning to
frame the finished nests and the boisterous winds of last month no
longer drown the babble of the tree-top parliament at the still hour
when farm labourers are homing from the fields that the rooks
peculiarly strike their own note in the country scene there is no good
reason to confuse these curious and interesting fowl with any other of
the crow family collectively they may be recognised by their love of
fellowship for none are more sociable than they individually the rook
is stamped unmistakably by the bald patch on the face where the
feathers have come away round the base of the beak the most generally
accepted explanation of this disfigurement is the rooks habit of
thrusting its bill deep in the earth in search of its daily food this
on the face of it looks like a reasonable explanation but it should be
borne in mind that not only do some individual rooks retain through
life the feathers normally missing but that several of the rooks
cousins dip into natures larder in the same fashion without suffering
any such loss however the featherless patch on the rooks cheeks
suffices whatever its cause as a mark by which to recognise the bird
living or dead

unlike its cousin the jackdaw which commonly nests in the cliffs the
rook is not perhaps commonly associated with the immediate
neighbourhood of the sea but a colony close to my own home in
devonshire displays sufficiently interesting adaptation to estuarine
conditions to be worth passing mention just in the same way that gulls
make free of the wireworms on windswept ploughlands so in early summer
do the old rooks come sweeping down from the elms on the hill that
overlooks my fishing ground and take their share of cockles and other
muddy fare in the bank uncovered by the falling tide here in company
with gulls turnstones and other fowl of the foreshore the rooks strut
importantly up and down digging their powerful bills deep in the ooze
and occasionally bullying weaker neighbours out of their hard-earned
spoils the rook is a villain yet there is something irresistible in
the effrontery with which one will hop sidelong on a gorging gull which
beats a hasty retreat before its sable rival leaving some half-prized
shellfish to be swallowed at sight or carried to the greedy little beaks
in the tree-tops while rooks are far more sociable than crows the two
are often seen in company not always on the best of terms but usually
in a condition suggestive of armed neutrality an occasional crow visits
my estuary at low tide but though the bird would be a match for any
single rook I never saw any fighting between them possibly the crow
feels its loneliness and realises that in case of trouble none of its
brothers are there to see fair play yet carrion crows like herons are
among the rooks most determined enemies and cases of rookeries being
destroyed by both birds are on record on the other hand though the
heron is the far more powerful bird of the two heronries have likewise
been scattered and their trees appropriated by rooks probably in
overwhelming numbers of the two the heron is particularly in the
vicinity of a preserved trout stream the more costly neighbour indeed
it is the only other bird which nests in colonies of such extent but
there is this marked difference between herons and rooks that the
former are sociable only in the colony when away on its own business
the heron is among the most solitary of birds having no doubt like
many other fishermen learnt the advantage of its own company

one of the most remarkable habits in the rook is that of visiting the
old nests in mid-winter now and again it is true a case of actually
nesting at that season has been noticed but the fancy for sporting
round the deserted nests is something quite different from this I have
watched the birds at the nests on short winter days year after year but
never yet saw any confirmation of the widely accepted view that their
object is the putting in order of their battered homes for the next
season it seems a likely reason but in that case the birds would
surely be seen carrying twigs for the purpose and I never saw them do
so before january what other attraction the empty nurseries can have
for them is a mystery unless indeed they are sentimental enough to like
revisiting old scenes and cawing over old memories

the proximity of a rookery does not affect all people alike some who
ordinarily dwelling in cities suffer from lack of bird neighbours
would regard the deliberate destruction of a rookery as an act of
vandalism a few as a matter of fact actually set about establishing
such a colony where none previously existed an ambition that may
generally be accomplished without extreme difficulty all that is needed
is to transplant a nest or two of young rooks and lodge them in suitable
trees the parent birds usually follow rear the broods and forthwith
found a settlement for future generations to return to even artificial
nests with suitable supplies of food have succeeded and it seems that
the rook is nowhere a very difficult neighbour to attract and establish

why are rooks more sociable than ravens and what do they gain from such
communalism these are favourite questions with persons informed with an
intelligent passion for acquiring information and the best answer
without any thought of irreverence is god knows it is most certain
that we at any rate do not so far from explaining how it was that
rooks came to build their nests in company we cannot even guess how the
majority of birds came to build nests at all instead of remaining
satisfied with the simpler plan of laying their eggs in the ground that
is still good enough for the petrels penguins kingfishers and many
other kinds protection of the eggs from rain frost and natural
enemies suggests itself as the object of the nest but the last only
would to some extent be furthered by the gregarious habit and even so
we have no clue as to why it should be any more necessary for rooks than
for crows to quote as some writers do the numerical superiority of
rooks over ravens as evidence of the benefits of communal nesting is to
ignore the long hostility of shepherds towards the latter birds on which
centuries of persecution have told irreparably rooks on the other
hand though also regarded in some parts of these islands as suspects
have never been harassed to the same extent and if anything in the
nature of general warfare were to be inaugurated against them the
gregarious habit so far from being a protection would speedily and
disastrously facilitate their extermination another curious habit
noticed in these birds is that of flying on fine evenings to a
considerable height and then swooping suddenly to earth often on their
backs these antics comparable to the drumming of snipe and roding of
woodcock are probably to be explained on the same basis of sexual
emotion

the so-called parliament of the rooks probably owes much of its detail
to the florid imagination of enthusiasts always ready to exaggerate the
wonders of nature but it also seems to have some existence in fact and
privileged observers have actually described the trial and punishment of
individuals that have broken the laws of the commune I never saw this
procedure among rooks but once watched something very similar among the
famous dogs of constantinople which no longer exist

the most important problem however in connection with the rook is the
precise extent to which the bird is the farmers enemy or his friend on
the solution hangs the rooks fate in an increasingly practical age
which may at any moment put sentiment on one side and decree for it the
fate that is already overtaking its big cousin the raven scotch farmers
have long turned their thumbs down and regarded rooks as food for the
gun but in south britain the birds apologists have hitherto been able
to hold their own and avert catastrophe from their favourite the
evidence is conflicting on the one hand it seems undeniable that the
rook eats grain and potato shoots it also snaps young twigs off the
trees and may like the jay and magpie destroy the eggs of game birds
on the other hand particularly during the weeks when it is feeding its
nestlings it admittedly devours quantities of wireworms leathergrubs
and weevils as well as of couch grass and other noxious weeds while
some of its favourite dainties such as thistles walnuts and acorns
will hardly be grudged at any time it is not an easy matter to decide
and if the rook is to be spared economy must be tempered with
sentiment in which case the evidence will perhaps be found to justify a
verdict of guilty with a strong recommendation to mercy

the cuckoo




the cuckoo


with the single exception of the nightingale bird of lovers no other
has been more written of in prose or verse than the so-called harbinger
of spring this is a foolish name for a visitor that does not reach our
shores before at any rate the middle of april even _whitaker_ allows
us to recognise the coming of spring nearly a month earlier and for
myself impatient if only for the illusion of natures awakening I date
my spring from the ending of the shortest day once the days begin to
lengthen it is time to glance at the elms for the return of the rooks
and to get out ones fishing-tackle again yet the cuckoo comes rarely
before the third week of april save in the fervent imagination of
premature heralds who giving rein to a fancy winged by desire or
honestly deceived by some village cuckoo clock heard on their country
rambles solemnly write to the papers announcing the inevitable march
cuckoo they know better in the channel islands for in the second week
of april and not before there are cuckoos in every bush hundreds of
exhausted travellers pausing for strength to complete the rest of their
journey to britain not on the return migration in august do the
wanderers assemble in the islands since having but lately set out
they are not yet weary enough to need the rest the only district of
england in which I have heard of similar gatherings of cuckoos is east
anglia where about the time of their arrival they regularly collect
in the bushes and indulge in preliminary gambols before flying north and
west

cuckoos then reach these islands about the third week of april and
they leave us again at the end of the summer the old birds flying south
in july the younger generation following three or four weeks later
goodness knows by what extraordinary instinct these young ones know the
way but the young cuckoo is a marvel altogether in the manner of its
education since when one comes to think of it it has no upbringing by
its own parents and cannot even learn how to cry cuckoo by example or
instruction its foster-parents speak another language and its own
folk have ceased from singing by the time it is out of the nest a good
deal has been written about the way in which the note varies chiefly in
the direction of greater harshness and a more staccato and less
sustained note towards the end of the cuckoos stay according to the
rustic rhyme it changes its tune in june which is probably poetic
licence rather than the fruits of actual observation it is however
commonly agreed that the cuckoo is less often heard as the time of its
departure draws near and the easiest explanation of its silence once
the breeding season is ended is that the note being the love-call of a
polygamous bird is no longer needed

in australia the female cuckoo is handsomely barred with white whereas
the male is uniformly black but with our bird it is exceedingly
difficult to distinguish one sex from the other on the wing and were
it not for occasional evidence of females having been shot when actually
calling we might still believe that it is the male only that makes this
sound the note is joyous only in the poets fancy just as the has also
read sadness into the sobbing of the nightingale there is indeed
when we consider its life something fantastic in the hypothesis that
the cuckoo can know no trouble in life merely because it escapes the
rigours of our winter eternal summer must be a delight but the cuckoo
has to work hard for the privilege and it must at times be harried to
the verge of desperation by the small birds that continually mob it in
broad daylight this behaviour on the part of its pertinacious little
neighbours has been the occasion of much futile speculation but the one
certain result of such persecution is to make the cuckoo along with its
fellow-sufferer the owls preferably active in the sweet peace of the
gloaming when its puny tyrants are gone to roost much heated argument
has raged round the real or supposed sentiment that inspires such
demonstrations on the part of linnets sparrows chaffinches and other
determined hunters of the cuckoo it seems impossible when we observe
the larger birds unmistakable desire to win free of them to attribute
friendly feelings to its pursuers yet some writers have held the
curious belief that with lingering memories of the days when a year
ago they devoted themselves to the ugly foster-child the little birds
still regard the stranger with affection if so then they have an
eccentric way of showing it and the cuckoo driven by the chattering
little termagants from pillar to post may well pray to be saved from
its friends on the other hand even though convinced of their
hostility it is not easy to believe as some folks tell us that they
mistake the cuckoo for a hawk even the human eye though slower to take
note of such differences can distinguish between the two and the
cuckoos note would still further undeceive them the most satisfactory
explanation of all perhaps is that the nest memories do in truth
survive not however investing the cuckoo with a halo of romance but
rather branding it as an object of suspicion an interloper to be
driven out of the neighbourhood at all costs ere it has time to billet
its offspring on the hard-working residents all of which is needless
to say the merest guesswork since any attempt to interpret the
simplest actions of birds is likely to lead us into erroneous
conclusions yet of the two it certainly seems more reasonable to
regard the smaller birds as resenting the parasitic habit in the cuckoo
than to admit that they can actually welcome the murder of their own
offspring to make room in the nest for the ugly changeling foisted on
them by this fly-by-night

on the _lucus a non lucendo_ principle the cuckoo is chiefly
interesting as a parent the bare fact is that our british kind builds
no nest of its own but puts its eggs out to hatch choosing for the
purpose the nests of numerous small birds which it knows to be suitable
further investigation of the habits of this not very secretive bird
shows that she first lays her egg on the ground and then carries it in
her bill to a neighbouring nest whether she first chooses the nest and
then lays the egg destined to be hatched in it or whether she lays each
egg when so moved and then hunts about for a home for it has never been
ascertained the former method seems the more practical of the two on
the other hand little nests of the right sort are so plentiful in may
that with her mother-instinct to guide her she could always find one
at a few moments notice some people who are never so happy as when
making the wonders of nature seem still more wonderful than they really
are have declared that the cuckoo lays eggs to match those among which
she deposits them or that at any rate she chooses the nests of birds
whose eggs approximately resemble her own I should have liked to
believe this but am unfortunately debarred by the memory of about forty
cuckoos eggs that I took seven-and-twenty summers ago in the woods
round dartford heath the majority of these were found in hedgesparrows
nests and the absolute dissimilarity between the great spotted egg of
the cuckoo and the little blue egg of its so-called dupe would have
impressed even a colour-blind animal occasionally I believe a blue
cuckoos egg has been found but such a freak could hardly be the result
of design as a matter of fact there is no need for any such elaborate
deception up to the moment of hatching the little foster-parents have
in all probability no suspicion of the trick that has been played on
them birds do not take deliberate notice of the size or colour of
their own eggs kearton somewhere relates how the once induced a
blackbird to sit on the eggs of a thrush and a lapwing on those of a
redshank so too farmyard hens will hatch the eggs of ducks or game
birds and wild birds can even be persuaded to sit on eggs made of
painted wood why then since they are so careless of appearances
should the cuckoo go to all manner of trouble to match the eggs of
hedgesparrow robin or warbler the bird would not notice the
difference and even if she did she would probably sit quite as close
if only for the sake of the other eggs of her own laying once the ugly
nestling is hatched there comes swift awakening yet there is no
thought of reprisal or desertion it looks rather as if the little
foster-parents are hypnotised by the uncouth guest for they see their
own young ones elbowed out of the home and continue with unflagging
devotion to minister to the insatiable appetite of the greedy little
murderer a bird so imbued as the parasitic cuckoo with the _wanderlust_
would make a very careless parent and we must therefore perhaps revise
our unflattering estimate of its attitude and admit that it does the
best it can by its offspring in putting them out to nurse this habit
unique among british birds is practised by many others elsewhere and
in particular by the american troupials or cattle-starlings one of
these indeed goes even farther since it entrusts its eggs to the care
of a nest-building cousin there are also american cuckoos that build
their own nest and incubate their own eggs

on the whole our cuckoo is a friend to the farmer for it destroys vast
quantities of hairy caterpillars that no other bird resident or
migratory would touch on the other hand no doubt the numbers of
other small useful birds must suffer not alone because the cuckoo sucks
their eggs but also because as has been shown the rearing of every
young cuckoo means the destruction of the legitimate occupants of the
nest so far however as the farmer is concerned this is probably
balanced by the reflection that a single young cuckoo is so rapacious as
to need all the insect food available

the cuckoo like the woodcock is supposed to have its forerunner just
as the small horned owl which reaches our shores a little in advance
of the latter is popularly known as the woodcock owl so also the
wryneck which comes to us about the same time as the first of the
cuckoos goes by the name of cuckoo-leader it is never a very
conspicuous bird and appears to be rarer nowadays than formerly
schoolboys know it best from its habit of hissing like a snake and
giving them a rare fright when they cautiously insert a predatory hand
in some hollow tree in search of a possible nest it is in such
situations that along with titmice and some other birds the wryneck
rears its young and it doubtless owes many an escape to this habit of
hissing accompanied by a vigorous twisting of its neck and the
infliction of a sufficient peck easily mistaken in a moment of panic
for the bite of an angry adder thus does nature protect her weaklings

voices of the night




voices of the night


the majority of nocturnal animals more particularly those bent on
spoliation are strangely silent true frogs croak in the marshes bats
shrill overhead at so high a pitch that some folks cannot hear them and
owls hoot from their ruins in a fashion that some vote melodious and
romantic while others associate the sound rather with midnight crime
and dislike it accordingly the badger on the other hand with the
otter and fox all of them sad thieves from our point of view have
learnt whatever their primeval habits to go about their marauding in
stealthy silence and it is only in less settled regions that one hears
the jackals barking the hyænas howling and the browsing deer whistling
through the night watches

there are however two of our native birds or rather summer visitors
since they leave us in autumn closely associated with these warm june
nights the stillness of which they break in very different fashion and
these are the nightingale and nightjar each is of considerable
interest in its own way it is not to be denied that the churring note
of the nightjar is to ordinary ears the reverse of attractive and the
bird is not much more pleasing to the eye than to the ear while the
nightingale on the contrary produces such sweet sounds as made izaak
walton marvel what music god could provide for his saints in heaven when
he gave such as this to sinners on earth the suggestion was not wholly
his own since the father of angling borrowed it from a french writer
but the vastly improved on the original and the passage will long live
in the hearts of thousands who care not a jot for his instructions in
respect of worms at the same time the nightjar though the less
attractive bird of the two is fully as interesting as its comrade of
the summer darkness and there should be no difficulty in indicating the
little that they have in common as well as much wherein they differ in
both habits and appearance

both then are birds of sober attire indeed of the two the nightjar
with its soft and delicately pencilled plumage and the conspicuous white
spots is perhaps the handsomer though as it is seen only in the
gloaming its quiet beauty is but little appreciated the unobtrusive
dress of the nightingale on the other hand is familiar in districts in
which the bird abounds and is commonly quoted by contrast with its
unrivalled voice as the converse of the gaudy colouring of raucous
macaws and parrakeets as has been said both these birds are summer
migrants the nightingale arriving on our shores about the middle of
april the nightjar perhaps a fortnight later thenceforth however
their programmes are wholly divergent for whereas the nightjars
proceed to scatter over the length and breadth of britain penetrating
even to ireland in the west and as far north as the hebrides the
nightingale stops far short of these extremes and leaves whole counties
of england as well as probably the whole of scotland and certainly the
whole of ireland out of its calculations it is however well known that
its range is slowly but surely extending towards the west

this curiously restricted distribution of the nightingale indeed
within the limits of its summer home is among the most remarkable of
the many problems confronting the student of distribution and
successive ingenious but unconvincing attempts to explain its seeming
eccentricity or at any rate caprice in the choice of its nesting range
only make the confusion worse briefly in spite of a number of doubtful
and even suspicious reports of the birds occurrence outside of these
boundaries it is generally agreed by the soundest observers that its
travels do not extend much north of the city of york or much west of a
line drawn through exeter and birmingham by way of complicating the
argument we know on good authority that the nightingales range is
equally peculiar elsewhere and that whereas it likewise shuns the
departments in the extreme west of france it occurs all over the
peninsula a region extending considerably farther into the sunset than
either brittany or cornwall in both of which it is unknown no
satisfactory explanation of the little visitors objection to wild wales
or cornwall has been found and it may at once be stated that its
capricious distribution cannot be accounted for by any known facts of
soil climate or vegetation since the surroundings which it finds
suitable in kent and sussex are equally to be found down in the west
country but fail to attract their share of nightingales

the song of the nightingale in praise of which volumes have been
written is perhaps more beautiful than that of any other bird though i
have heard wonderful efforts from the mocking-bird in the united states
and from the bulbuls along the banks of the jordan the latter are
sometimes more especially in poetry regarded as identical with the
nightingale and indeed some ornithologists hold the two to be closely
related what a gap there is between the sobbing cadences of the
nightingale and the rasping note of the nightjar which with specific
reference to a colonial cousin of that bird tasmanians ingeniously
render as more pork it seems almost ludicrous to include under the
head of birdsong not only the music of the nightingale but also the
croak of the raven and the booming note of the ostrich yet these also
are the love-songs of their kind and the hen ostrich doubtless finds
more music in the thunderous note of her lord than in the faint melody
of such song-birds as her native africa provides the nightingale sings
to his mate while she is sitting on her olive-green eggs perching on a
low branch of the tree at foot of which the slender nest is hidden in
the undergrowth so much is known to every schoolboy who is too often
guided by the sound on his errand of plunder and why the song of this
particular warbler should have been described by so many writers as one
of sadness seeing that it is associated with the most joyous days in
the birds year passes comprehension so obviously is its object to
hearten the female in her long and patient vigil that as soon as the
young are hatched the males voice breaks like that of other choristers
to a guttural croak it is said indeed though so cruel an experiment
would not appeal to many that if the nest be destroyed just as the
young are hatched the bird recovers all his sweetness of voice and sings
anew while another home is built

although poetic licence has ascribed the song to the female it is the
male nightingale only that sings and for the purpose aforementioned
the note of the nightjar on the other hand is equally uttered by both
sexes and both also have the curious habit of repeatedly clapping the
wings for several minutes together they moreover share the business of
incubation taking day and night duty on the eggs which two in number
are laid on the bare ground without any pretence of a nest and
generally on open commons in the neighbourhood of patches of fern-brake
like the owls these birds sleep during the day and are active only when
the sun goes down it is this habit of seeking their insect food only in
the gloaming which makes nightjars among the most difficult of birds to
study from life and all accounts of their feeding habits must therefore
be received with caution particularly that which compares the bristles
on the mouth with baleen in whales serving as a sort of strainer for
the capture of minute flying prey this is an interesting suggestion
and may even be sober fact but its adoption would necessitate the bird
flying open-mouthed among the oaks and other trees beneath which it
finds the yellow underwings and cockchafers on which it feeds and i
have more than once watched it hunting its victims with the beak closed
I noticed this particularly when camping in the backwoods of eastern
canada where the bird goes by the name of nighthawk

in all probability its food consists exclusively of insects though
exceptional cases have been noted in which the young birds had evidently
been fed on seeds the popular error which charges it with stealing the
milk of ewes and goats from which it derives the undeserved name of
goat-sucker with its equivalent in several continental languages is
another result of the imperfect light in which it is commonly observed
needless to say there is no truth whatever in the accusation for the
nightjar would find no more pleasure in drinking milk than we should in
eating moths

here then are two night-voices of very different calibre these are
not our only birds that break the silence on moonlight nights in june
the common thrush often sings far into the night and the sedge-warbler
is a persistent caroller that has often been mistaken for the
nightingale the difference in this respect between the two subjects of
these remarks is that the nightjar is invariably silent all through the
day whereas the nightingale sings joyously at all hours it is only
because his splendid music is more marked in the comparative silence of
the night with little or no competition that his daylight concert is
often overlooked

swifts swallows and martins




swifts swallows and martins


when the trout-fisherman sees the first martins and swallows dipping
over the sward of the water-meadows and skimming the surface of the
stream in hot pursuit of such harried water-insects as have escaped the
jaws of greedy fish the knows that summer is coming in the signs of
spring have been evident in the budding hedgerows for some weeks the
rooks are cawing in the elms the cuckoos note has been heard in the
spinney for some time before these little visitors pass in jerky flight
up and down the valley then a little later come the swifts the black
and screaming swifts which though learned folk may be right in
sundering them utterly from their smaller travelling companions from the
sunny south will always in the popular fancy be associated with the
rest colonies of swifts swallows and martins are a dominant feature
of english village life during the warm months and though there are
fastidious folk who take not wholly culpable exception to their little
visitors on the score of cleanliness most of us welcome them back each
year if only for the sake of the glad season of their stay if
moreover it is a question of choice between these untiring travellers
resting in our eaves and the stay-at-home starling or sparrow the
choice will surely fall on the first every time

the swift is the largest and most rapid in its flight and its voice has
a penetrating quality lacking in the notes of the rest swifts screaming
in headlong flight about a belfry or up and down a country lane are the
embodiment of that sheer joy of life which in some cases with slender
reason we associate peculiarly with the bird-world probably however
these summer migrants are as happy as most of their class on the wing
they can have few natural enemies though one may now and again be
struck down by a hawk and they alight on the ground so rarely as to run
little risk from cats or weasels while the structure and position of
their nests alike afford effectual protection for the eggs and young
compared with that of the majority of small birds therefore their
existence should be singularly happy and free from care and though
that of the swift can scarcely perhaps when we remember its shrill
voice be described as one grand sweet song it should not be chequered
by many troubles the greatest risk is no doubt that of being snapped up
by some watchful pike if the bird skims too close to the surface of
either still or running water and I have even heard of their being
seized in this way by hungry mahseer those great barbel which gladden
the heart of exiled anglers whose lot is cast on the banks of himalayan
rivers

it is however the sparrows and starlings rivals for the nesting
sites who show themselves the irreconcilable enemies of the returned
prodigals terrific battles are continually enacted between them with
varying fortunes and the anecdotes of these frays would fill a volume
jesse tells of a feud at hampton court in the course of which the
swallows having only then completed their nest were evicted by
sparrows who forthwith took possession and hatched out their eggs then
came nemesis for the sparrows were compelled to go foraging for food
with which to fill the greedy beaks and during their enforced absence
the swallows returned in force threw the nestlings out and demolished
the home the sparrows sought other quarters and the swallows
triumphantly built a new nest on the ruins of the old a german writer
relates a case of revolting reprisal on the part of some swallows
against a sparrow that appropriated their nest and refused to quit
after repeated failure to evict the intruder the swallows helped by
other members of the colony calmly plastered up the front door so
effectually that the unfortunate sparrow was walled up alive and died of
hunger this refined mode of torture is not unknown in the history of
mankind but seems singularly unsuited to creatures so fragile

the nests of these birds show as a rule little departure from the
conventional plan but they do adapt their architecture to
circumstances and I remember being much struck on one occasion by the
absence of any dome or roof it was in asia minor on the seashore that
I came upon a cottage long deserted its door hanging by one hinge and
all the glass gone from the windows in the empty rooms numerous
swallows were rearing twittering broods in roofless nests no doubt the
birds realised that they had nothing to fear from rain and were
reluctant to waste time and labour in covering their homes with
unnecessary roofs

most birds are careful in the education of their young and indeed
thorough training at an early stage must be essential in the case of
creatures that are left to protect themselves and to find their own food
when only a few weeks old fortunately they develop with a rapidity that
puts man and other mammals to shame and the helpless bald little swift
lying agape in the nest will in another fortnight be able to fly across
europe one of the most favoured observers of the early teaching given
by the mother-swallow to her brood was an angler who told me how one
evening when the was fishing in some ponds at no great distance from
london a number of baby swallows alighted on his rod the kept as still
as possible fearful of alarming his interesting visitors but the must
at last have moved for with one accord they all fell off his rod
together skimmed over the surface of the water and disappeared in the
direction from which they had come a few moments earlier

swifts fly to an immense height these july evenings mounting to such an
altitude as eventually to disappear out of sight altogether this
curious habit which is but imperfectly understood has led to the
belief that instead of roosting in the nest or among the reeds like the
swallows the males at any rate spend the night flying about under the
stars this fantastic notion is not however likely to commend itself
to those who pause to reflect on the incessant activity displayed by
these birds the livelong day so rarely indeed do they alight that
country folk gravely deny them the possession of feet and it is in the
last degree improbable that a bird of such feverish alertness could
dispense with its nights rest no one who has watched swifts swallows
and martins on the wing can fail to be struck by the extraordinary
judgment with which these untiring birds seem to shave the arches of
bridges gateposts and other obstacles in the way of their flight by so
narrow a margin as continually to give the impression of catastrophe
imminent and inevitable their escapes from collision are marvellous
but the birds are not infallible as is shown by the untoward fate of a
swallow in sussex in an old garden in that county there had for many
years been an open doorway with no door and through the open space the
swallows had been wont year after year to fly to and fro on their
hunting trips then came a fateful winter during which a new owner took
it into his head to put up a fresh gate and to keep it locked and as
ill luck would have it the painted it blue which in the season of fine
weather probably heightened the illusion back came the happy swallows
to their old playground and one of the pioneers flew headlong at the
closed gate and fell stunned and dying on the ground a minor tragedy
that may possibly come as a surprise to those who regard the instincts
of wild birds as unerring

that the young swallows leave our shores before their elders late in
august or early in september is an established fact and the instinct
which guides them aright over land and sea without assistance from
those more experienced is nothing short of amazing the swifts last
to come are also first to go spending less time in the land of their
birth than either swallows or martins the fact that an occasional
swallow has been seen in this country during the winter months finds
expression in the adage that one swallow does not make a summer and
it was no doubt this occasional apparition that in a less enlightened
age seemed to warrant the extraordinary belief which still ekes out a
precarious existence in misinformed circles that these birds instead
of wintering abroad retire in a torpid condition to the bottom of lakes
and ponds it cannot be denied that these waters have occasionally when
dredged or drained yielded a stray skeleton of a swallow but it should
be evident to the most homely intelligence that such débris merely
indicates careless individuals that in passing over the water got
their plumage waterlogged and were then drowned it seems strange that
gilbert white so accurate an observer of birds should actually have
toyed with this curious belief though the leant rather to the more
reasonable version of occasional hybernation in caves or other
sheltered hiding-places the rustic mind however preferred and in
some unsophisticated districts still prefers the ancient belief in
diving swallows and no weight of evidence however carefully presented
would shake it in its creed fortunately this eccentric view of the
swallows habits brings no harm to the bird itself and may thus be
tolerated as an innocuous indulgence on the part of those who prefer
this fiction to the even stranger truth

the seagull




the seagull


so glorious is the flight of the seagull that it tempts us to fling
aside the dry-as-dust theories of mechanism of flexed wings coefficient
of air resistance and all the abracadabra of the mathematical
biologist and just to give thanks for a sight so inspiring as that of
gulls ringing high in the eye of the wind over hissing combers that
break on sloping beaches or around jagged rocks these birds are one
with the sea knowing no fear of that protean monster which since
earths beginning has always with its unfathomable mystery its
insatiable cruelty its tremendous strength been a source of terror to
the land animals that dwell in sight of it yet the gulls sit on the
curling rollers as much at their ease as swimmers in a pond and give an
impression of unconscious courage very remarkable in creatures that seem
so frail hunger may drive them inland or instincts equally
irresistible at the breeding season but never the worst gale that
lashes the sea to fury for they dread it in its hour of rage as little
as on still summer nights when in their hundreds they fly off the land
to roost on the water outside the headlands

it is curious that there should be no mention of them in the sacred
writings we read of quails coming in from the sea likewise of four
great beasts but of seafowl never a word though one sees them in
abundance on the coast near jaffa and the hebrew writers might have
been expected to weave them into the rich fabrics of their poetic
imagery as they did the pelican the eagle and other birds less
familiar although seagulls have of late years been increasingly in
evidence beside the bridges of london they are still to the majority
of folk living far inland symbolical of the august holiday at the
coast and their splendid flight and raucous cries are among the most
enduring memories of that yearly escape from the smoke of cities

the voice of gulls can with difficulty be regarded as musical yet those
of us who live the year round by the sea find their plaintive mewing as
nicely tuned to that wild environment as the amorous gurgling of
nightingales to moonlit woods in may their voice may have no great
range but at any rate it is not lacking in variety suggesting to the
playful imagination laughter tears and other human moods to which they
are in all probability strangers the curious similarity between the
note of a seagull and the whining of a cat bereft of her kittens is very
striking and was on one occasion the cause of my being taken in by one
of these birds in a deep and beautiful backwater of the sea of marmora
beside which I spent one pleasant summer in this particular gulf at
the head of which stands the ancient town of ismidt gulls though
plentiful in the open sea are rarely in evidence being replaced by
herons and pelicans I had not therefore set eyes on a seagull for many
weeks when early one morning I heard from the farther side of a wooded
headland a new note suggestive of a wild cat or possibly a lynx my
greek servant tried in his patois to explain the unseen owner of the
mysterious voice but it was only when a small gull suddenly came
paddling round the corner that I realised my mistake

in addition to being at home on the seashore and particularly in
estuaries and where the coast is rocky gulls are a familiar sight in
the wake of steamers at the beginning and ending of the voyage as well
as following the plough and nesting in the vicinity of inland meres and
marshes the black-headed kind is peculiarly given to bringing up its
family far from the sea just as the salmon ascends our rivers for the
same purpose it is not perhaps a very loving parent seeing that the
mortality among young gulls many of which show signs of rough treatment
by their elders is unusually great on most lakes rich in fish these
birds have long established themselves and they were I remember as
familiar at geneva and neuchâtel as along the shores of lake tahoe in
the californian sierras itself two hundred miles from the pacific and
more than a mile above sea-level gulls also follow the plough in
hordes not always to the complete satisfaction of the farmer who is
not unreasonably sceptical when told that they seek wireworms only and
have no taste for grain unfortunately the ordinary scarecrow has no
terror for them and I recollect in the neighbourhood of maryport
seeing an immense number of gulls turning up the soil in close proximity
to several crows that dangling from gibbets effectually kept all black
marauders away

young gulls are to the careless eye apt to look larger than their
parents an illusion possibly due to the optical effect of their dappled
plumage and few people unfamiliar with these birds in their succeeding
moults readily believe that the dark birds are younger than the white
down in little cornish harbours I have sometimes watched these young
birds turned to good account by their lazy elders who call them to the
feast whenever the ebbing tide uncovers a heap of dead pilchards lying
in three or four feet of water and then pounce on them the moment they
come to the surface with their booty the fact is that gulls are not
expert divers the cormorant and puffin and guillemot can vanish at the
flash of a gun reappearing far from where they were last seen and can
pursue and catch some of the swiftest fishes under water some gulls
however are able to plunge farther below the surface than others and
the little kittiwake is perhaps the most expert diver of them all
though in no sense at home under water like the shag I have often when
at anchor ten or fifteen miles from the land and attended by the usual
convoy of seabirds that invariably gather round fishing-boats amused
myself by throwing scraps of fish to them and watching the gulls do
their best to plunge below the surface when some coveted morsel was
going down into the depths and now and again a little roman-nose puffin
would dive headlong and snatch the prize from under the gulls eyes
most of the birds were fearless enough only an occasional
saddleback the greater black-backed gull of the text-books knowing
the hand of man to be against it for its raids on game and poultry
would keep at a respectful distance

considered economically the smaller gulls at any rate have more friends
than enemies and they owe most of the latter not so much to their
appetites which set more store by offal and carrion than by anything of
greater value as to their exceedingly dirty habits these unclean fowl
are in fact anything but welcome in harbours given over in summer to
smart yachting craft and I remember how at avalon the port of santa
catalina island cal various devices were employed to prevent them
alighting boats at their moorings were festooned with strips of
bunting which apparently had the requisite effect and the railings of
the club were protected by a formidable armour of nails on the credit
side of their account with ourselves seagulls are admittedly assiduous
scavengers and their services in keeping little tidal harbours clear of
decaying fish which if left to accumulate would speedily breed a
pestilence cannot well be overrated the fishermen though they rarely
molest them do not always refer to the birds with the gratitude that
might be expected yet they are still further in their debt being often
apprised by their movement of the whereabouts of mackerel and pilchard
shoals and in thick weather getting many a friendly warning of the
whereabouts of outlying rocks from the hoarse cries of the gulls that
have their haunts on these menaces to inshore navigation

seagulls are not commonly made pets of the nearest approach to such
adoption being an occasional pinioned individual enjoying qualified
liberty in a backyard their want of popularity is easily understood
since they lack the music of the canary and the mimicry of parrots that
they are however capable of appreciating kindness has been
demonstrated by many anecdotes the rev h a macpherson used to tell a
story of how a young gull found with a broken wing by the children of
some milovaig crofters was nursed back to health by them until it
eventually flew away not long after it had gone one of the children
was lost on the hillside and the gull flying overhead recognised one
of its old playmates and hovered so as to attract the attention of the
child then on being called the bird settled and roosted on the ground
beside him an even more remarkable story is told of a gull taken from
the nest on the coast of county cork and brought up by hand until in
the following spring it flew away in the company of some others of its
kind that passed over the garden in which it had its liberty the birds
owner reasonably concluded that the had seen the last of his protégée
and great was his astonishment when in the first october gale not
only did the visitor return tapping at the dining-room window for
admission as it had always done but actually brought with it a young
gull and the two paid him a visit every autumn for a number of years

on either side of the gulls and closely associated with them in habits
and in structure is a group of birds equally characteristic of the open
coast the skuas and terns the skuas darker and more courageous birds
are familiar to those who spend their august holiday sea-fishing near
the lands end where particularly on days when the east wind brings
the gannets and porpoises close inshore the great skua may be seen at
its favourite game of swooping on the gulls and making them disgorge or
drop their launce or pilchard which the bird usually retrieves before
it reaches the water this act of piracy has earned for the skua its
west country sobriquet of jack harry and against so fierce an
onslaught even the largest gull though actually of heavier build than
its tyrant has no chance and seldom indeed seems to offer the feeblest
resistance these skuas rob their neighbours in every latitude and
even in the antarctic one kind closely related to our own makes havoc
among the penguins an episode described by the late dr wilson one of
the heroes of the ill-fated scott expedition

far more pleasing to the eye are the graceful little terns or
sea-swallows fairylike creatures with red legs and bill long pointed
wings and deeply forked tail which skim the surface of the sea or hawk
over the shallows of trout streams in search of dragonflies or small
fish it is not a very rare experience for the trout-fisherman to hook a
swallow which may happen to dash by at the moment of casting but a much
more unusual occurrence was that of a tern on a well-known pool of the
spey actually mistaking a salmon-fly for a small fish and swooping on
it only to get firmly hooked by the bill fortunately for the too
venturesome tern the fisherman was a lover of birds and the managed with
some difficulty to reel it in gently after which it was released none
the worse for its mistake

birds in the corn




birds in the corn


more than one of our summer visitors like the nightingale and cuckoo
are less often seen than heard but certainly the most secretive hider
of them all is the landrail this harsh-voiced bird reaches our shores
in may and it was on the last of that month that I lately heard its
rasping note in a quiet park not a mile out of a busy market town on the
welsh border and forgave its monotone because more emphatically than
even the cuckoos dissyllable it announced that at last summer was
icumen in this feeble-looking but indomitable traveller is closely
associated during its visit with the resident partridge they nest in
the same situations hiding in the fields of grass and standing corn
and eventually being flushed in company by september guns walking
abreast through the clover-bud sport is not the theme of these notes
and it will therefore suffice to remark in passing on the curious manner
in which even good shots accustomed to bring down partridges with some
approach to certainty contrive to miss these lazy flapping fowl when
walking them up dispassionately considered the landrail should be a
bird that a man could scarcely miss on the first occasion of his
handling a gun in cold fact it often survives two barrels apparently
untouched this immunity it owes in all probability to its slow and
heavy flight since those whose eyes are accustomed to the rapid
movement of partridges are apt to misjudge the allowance necessary for
such a laggard and to fire in front of it it is difficult to realise
that whereas the strong-winged partridge is a stay-at-home the
deliberate landrail has come to us from africa and will if spared by
the guns return there

perhaps the most curious and interesting habit recorded of the landrail
is that of feigning death when suddenly discovered a method of
self-defence which it shares with opossums spiders and in fact other
animals of almost every class it will if suddenly surprised by a dog
lie perfectly still and betray no sign of life there is however at
least one authentic case of a landrail actually dying of fright when
suddenly seized and it is a disputed point whether the so-called
pretence of death should not rather be regarded as a state of trance
strict regard for the truth compels the admission that on the only
occasion on which I remember taking hold of a live corncrake the bird
so far from pretending to be dead pecked my wrist heartily

just as the countryfolk regard the wryneck as leader of the wandering
cuckoos and the short-eared owl as forerunner of the woodcocks so the
ancients held that the landrail performed the same service of pioneer to
the quail on its long journeys over land and sea save in exceptional
years england is not visited by quail in sufficient numbers to lend
interest to this aspect of a bird attractive on other grounds but the
coincidence of their arrival with us is well established

the voice of the corncrake easily distinguished from that of any other
bird of our fields may be approximately reproduced by using a blunt saw
against the grain on hard wood so loud is it at times that I have heard
it from the open window of an express train the noise of which drowned
all other birdsong and it seems remarkable that such a volume of sound
should come from a throat so slender yet the rasping note is welcome
during the early days of its arrival since just as the cuckoo gave
earlier message of spring so the corncrake in sadder vein heralds the
ripeness of our briefer summer

the east anglian name dakker-hen comes from an old word descriptive of
the birds halting flight and indeed to see a landrail drop as already
mentioned after flying a few yards makes one incredulous when tracing
its long voyages on the map in the first place however it should be
remembered that the bird does not drop back in the grass because it is
tired but solely because it knows the way to safety by running out of
sight in the second the apparent weakness of its wings is not real
quails have little round wings that look ill adapted to long journeys i
have been struck by this times and again when shooting quail in egypt
and morocco yet of the quails fitness for travel there has never
since bible days been any question

the landrail is an excellent table bird personally I prefer it to the
partridge but this is perhaps praising it too highly legally of
course it is game as a game licence must be held by anyone who shoots
it and though protected in this country only under the wild birds act
irish law extends this by a month so that it may not be shot in that
country after the last day of january like most migratory birds its
numbers vary locally in different seasons and its scarcity in
hampshire to which white makes reference has by no means been
maintained of recent years as large bags have been recorded in every
part of that county

the common partridge is at any rate for the naturalist a less
interesting subject than its red-legged cousin which seems to have been
first introduced from france or possibly from the island of guernsey
where it no longer exists in the reign of charles iI that this early
experiment was not however attended by far-reaching results seems
probable since early in the reign of george iiI we find the marquis of
hertford and other well-known sporting landowners making fresh attempts
the stock of frenchmen being renewed from time to time during the
next fifty years chiefly on the east side of england where they have
always been more in evidence than farther west in devon and cornwall
indeed the bird is very rare and in ireland almost unknown

its red legs stand it in good stead for it can run like a hare and in
this way it often baffles the guns it is not however so much its
reluctance to rise that has brought it into disrepute with keepers as
its alleged habit of ousting the native bird in much the same way as
the hanover rat has superseded the black aboriginal although far from
the frenchman driving the english partridge off the soil there
appears to be even no truth in the supposed hostility between the two
since they do not commonly affect the same type of country and even
when they meet they nest in close proximity and in comparative harmony
nevertheless the males even of the same species are apt to be
pugnacious in the breeding season

both the partridge and landrail run serious risk from scythe and plough
while sitting on the nest landrails have before now been decapitated by
the swing of the scythe and a case is on record in which a sitting
partridge seeing that the plough was coming dangerously near her nest
actually removed the whole clutch of eggs numbering over a score to
the shelter of a neighbouring hedge this was accomplished probably
with the help of the male during the short time it took the plough to
get to the end of the field and back and is a remarkable illustration
of devotion and ingenuity not for nothing indeed is the partridge a
game bird for it has been seen to attack cats and even foxes in
defence of the covey and I have seen in the ms notes of the second
earl of malmesbury preserved in the library at heron court mention of
one that drove off a carrion crow that menaced the family both
partridge and landrail sit very close particularly when the time of
hatching is near and charles st john saw a partridge which his dog
having taken off the nest was forced to drop none the worse for her
adventure go straight back to her duties though as the adds if it had
not been that she knew that the eggs were already chipping she would in
all probability have deserted her post for good and all

whether or not france is to be regarded as the original home of the red
leg the fact remains that in that country it is becoming scarcer every
year its numbers being maintained only in brittany calvados orne and
sarthe its distribution in italy is equally capricious for it is
virtually restricted to the rocky slopes of the apennines the
volterrano hills in tuscany and the coast ranges of elba it seems
therefore that in continental countries as well as with us the bird
extends its range reluctantly game-preservers seem however to agree
that partridges and pheasants are beyond a certain point incompatible
as with a limited supply of natural food the smaller bird goes to the
wall like most birds partridges grow bold when pressed by cold and
hunger and I recollect hearing of a large covey being encountered ten
or twelve years ago in an open space in the heart of the city of
frankfort

the moping owl




the moping owl


music vocal or otherwise is always a matter of taste and individual
appreciation of birdsong varies like the rest one man finds the
cuckoos cry intolerably wearisome another sees no romance in the
gargling of doves while comparatively few care for the piercing scream
of the starling or the rasping note of the corncrake yet few birds
perform to a more hostile audience than the owl I say advisedly the
owl since the vast majority of people make no distinction whatever
between our three resident kinds of owl not to mention at least half a
dozen more visitors some excuse for such carelessness might perhaps be
found in the similar flight and habits of different owls but it might
have been thought that greater measure of individual recognition on
their own merits would have been conceded to birds that range in size
from the dimensions of a sparrow to those of a duck but no an owl is
just an owl why the soft and haunting cry of these birds should not
merely displease but actually alarm so many people unaccustomed to
such sounds of the gloaming and darkness it would be difficult to say
but the voice of owls may possibly owe some of its disturbing effect to
contrast with their silent flight which thanks to their fluffy
plumage with its broad quills and long barbs prevents their making
much more noise than ghosts when hunting rats and mice in moonlit
fields only one other english bird has so quiet a flight and that is
the nightjar another creature of the darkness which though no cousin
to these nocturnal birds of prey is known in some parts of the country
as the fern-owl visitors unprepared for the eerie woodland music of
these autumn nights shudder when they hear the cry of the owl as if it
suggested midnight crime for myself I have more agreeable associations
since I never hear one of these birds without recalling a gallant fight
I once had with a big tweed salmon in the weak light of a young moon
while three owls hooted amid the ghostly ruins of norham castle yet
even apart from this wholly agreeable memory I find nothing unpleasant
in their music and can readily conceive that the moping owl may sing to
his mate as passionately as philomel

not only is there the popular lack of distinction between one owl and
another already referred to but scientific ornithologists have
displayed similar want of finality in classifying these birds there are
as in seals eared and earless owls though the so-called ears in the
birds are not actually ears at all but tufts of feathers that give
rather the impression of horns there are bare-legged owls and owls with
feather stockings there are owls that fly by day and owls that fly by
night though this is a less satisfactory distinction than that between
the diurnal butterflies and nocturnal moths any reliable classification
of owls must in short rest on certain structural bony differences of
interest only to the student of anatomy nearly all these birds are able
to turn the outer toe completely round and most of them also have
very keen hearing which must be an invaluable aid when hunting small
animals in the dark

did the ancients actually regard the owl as a wise bird or was the
fashion of depicting it in the following of minerva merely dictated by
the presence of these birds on the akropolis it seems hardly
conceivable that they could so have blundered as to call the owls that
we know clever birds and the alternative assumption that owlish
intellect can have appreciably changed in the interval is even less
acceptable it is probable that too much significance need not be
attached to such association between the greek goddess of wisdom and her
attendant owls for hindu symbolism represented ganesa god of wisdom
with the head of an elephant yet that animal which the natives of
india know better than the men of any other race has never figured in
their folklore as a type noted for its cunning about the owl as we know
it to-day with its spectacled face and blinking eyes there is nothing
strikingly intelligent and schoolboy slang in which the word does duty
as synonymous with foolishness discovers a more accurate appreciation
of these birds

seen at its worst when surprised in the glare of daylight and mobbed by
a furious rabble of little birds an owl looks a helpless fool indeed
though this is not the proper moment to judge of the birds
possibilities under happier circumstances why these small fowl should
bully it at all is one of those woodland problems that no one has yet
solved the first and obvious explanation is that they know it for
their enemy and it may be indeed that owls commit depredations on the
nests of wild birds of which we who academically regard their food as
consisting of rats bats and mice or in the case of larger species of
young game and leverets have no inkling if however such is the case
it is strange that the habit should have been overlooked by those who
have paid close attention to this curious and interesting group
bird-catchers at any rate without troubling to inquire into the
reason turn the instinct to profitable account and in some parts of
the country a stuffed owl is an important item of their stock-in-trade

the majority of owls that either reside in or visit these islands are
benefactors of the farmer and should be spared the larger eagle-owl
and snowy owl eat more expensive food though seeing that they come to
us at any rate in the south country only in winter and even then
irregularly they can do no damage to young game birds and are probably
incapable of capturing old the worst offender among the residents is
the tawny owl to which I find the following reference in the famous
malmesbury mss: common here  a great destroyer of young game and
leverets  they sit in ivy bushes during the day and I have known one
remain altho its mate was killed in the same tree in such a state of
torpor did it appear to be the screech owl is a harmless bird and a
terror to mice and any doubt as to its claim on the farmers
hospitality would at once be removed by cursory examination of the
undigested pellets which in common with hawks these birds cast up
after their meals

on the other hand there is sometimes good reason for modifying any plea
for kindness to owls handsome is as handsome does and many of these
birds are during the nesting season not only savage in defence of
their young but actually so aggressive as to make unprovoked attack on
all and sundry who unwittingly approach closer to the tree than these
devoted householders think desirable accounts of this troublesome mood
in nesting owls come from several parts of the country and notably from
wales in one case on record a pair of barn owls had their home in a
tree overlooking milford haven and the vicinity of the nest soon became
dangerous the male owl tore a boys ear knocked a man down and
attacked numerous human beings and dogs that made use of a path leading
past the tree and these episodes were in fact of daily occurrence until
some one shot the bird another pair of barn owls nested in a wood on
the shore of menaI strait and in this case the young birds managed to
fall out of the nest and lay on the ground in full view of a public
right of way why the old birds did not put their offspring back in the
nest no one knew possibly they realised that the talons which so
efficiently gripped rats might not prove gentle enough for the
transport of owlets at any rate whatever their reason they left the
young birds on the ground feeding them in that position and flew at
everyone who passed that way clawing face and ears and eventually
establishing a reign of terror another owl behaved in somewhat similar
fashion in a spinney close to axmouth south devon punishing a
coastguard so severely that the man took to his heels such determined
tactics in defence of the young are the more singular when we remember
that owls are in normal circumstances shy and retiring birds yet they
occasionally seem to be possessed by more sociable instincts in proof
of which one of the long-eared kind has been seen feeding in the company
of tame hawks a pair of owls once nested in a dovecote close to a
keepers lodge in the highlands and wild owls have been known to pay
nightly visits to a cage in the botanic gardens at launceston
tasmania in order to bring food to their captive friends

even apart from these rigorous measures of defence the nesting habits
of owls are not without interest the majority lay their eggs in either
hollow trees or ruins and it is worth remark that these nocturnal
birds bring up their young in darkness whereas the hawks birds of
daylight rear theirs in open nests high up in trees or on rocky
ledges in the full glare of the sun one owl indeed habitually burrows
in the prairies and pampas in the curious company of marmots and
rattlesnakes and this burrowing habit is also in some parts of the
united states adopted by the common barn owl owls generally brood from
the laying of the first egg with the obvious result that young birds in
various stages of plumage are found together in the nest it has been
suggested that the body of the first to leave the egg helps to keep the
unhatched eggs warm while the parents are away foraging else its
presence would be a serious handicap the first little owl to hatch out
is usually ready to leave the nest soon after the arrival of the last
though these chicks come into the world more helpless even than the
majority of birds

waterfowl




waterfowl


had these notes been written from the standpoint of sport the three
familiar groups of birds which together make up this world-wide aquatic
family might better have borne their alternative title wildfowl with
its covert sneer at the hand-reared pheasant and artificially encouraged
partridge that between them furnish so much comfortable sport to those
with no fancy for the arduous business of the mudflats it is true that
of late years the mallard has in experienced hands made a welcome
addition to the bag in covert shooting as those will remember who have
shot the lockwood beat on the last day of the shoot at nuneham and
there is historic evidence of wild duck having been reared for
purposes of sport with hawks in the reign of charles I yet such
armchair shooting of wildfowl was ignored by colonel hawker and the
second earl of malmesbury both of whom gunning in the creeks and
estuaries of the south coast made immense bags of ducks and geese
working hard for every bird and displaying spartan indifference to the
rigours of wintry weather to hardy sportsmen of their type wildfowl
offer red-letter days with punt or shoulder guns not to be dreamt of
under the ægis of the gamekeeper

in this country at any rate we associate the v-shaped companies of
wigeon and gaggles of geese with an ice-bound landscape though in
exceptional years even where they no longer stay to breed these
night-flying northerners linger to the coming of spring and hawker
noticed the curious apparition of grey geese and swallows in company on
the first day of april  this wedge formation of flight over land
and sea is not only peculiar to these waterfowl but is not apparently
adopted by any other long distance migrants no satisfactory explanation
of their preference for flying in this order has been found but it is
thought to lessen the air resistance which must be a consideration for
these short-pinioned fowl that weigh heavy in proportion to their
displacement and at the same time lack the tremendous spread of wing
that enables the wandering albatross to soar for days together over the
illimitable ocean with one noticeable exception these waterfowl
exhibit a more extraordinary range of size and weight than any other
family of birds from the whooper swan five feet long and twenty-five
pounds on the scales down to the little teal with an overall
measurement of only fourteen inches and a weight that does not exceed as
many ounces the only other family of birds running to such extremes is
that of the birds of prey which include at once the stately condor of
the andes with its wing-spread of fifteen feet and the miniature
red-legged falconet of india and adjoining countries in which the same
measurement would scarcely reach as many inches

since even game birds are derisively referred to as tame only by those
ignorant of the facts the birds now under notice differ in this respect
from all those previously dealt with and they are geographically apart
again from our other domesticated animals since they are not like the
barndoor fowl and most of the rest of asiatic origin but must often
in the grey of a winter morning be conscious of their near relations
flying at liberty across the sky the geese and ducks have been
remarkably transformed by the process of domestication and a comparison
between those of the farmyard and their kindred in the marshes should
illustrate not only the relative value of most virtues but also the
all-importance of aristotles how when and where strictly speaking no
doubt the tame birds have degenerated both mentally and physically as
surely as the tame ass they have lost the acute perceptions and swift
flight of their wild relations economically on the other hand they
are immeasurably improved since the farmer indifferent to the more
inspiring personality of the grey goose and the mallard merely wants
his poultry to be greedy and stupid fattening themselves incessantly
for leadenhall and easily captured when required

between swans geese and ducks there is little anatomical difference
save in the matter of size the swans are the giants of the race and
the swans of three continents are white it was left for australia land
of topsy-turveydom to produce a black swan I spare the reader the
obvious classical tag and this remarkable bird first observed by
europeans in the early days of  was quickly brought to europe and
figures in the earliest list of animals shown in the london zoological
gardens all these birds have a curious trick of hissing when angry and
this habit perhaps because it is usually accompanied by a deliberate
stretching of the neck to its full length is seriously regarded by some
as conscious mimicry of snakes a proposition that must be left to
individual taste but that strikes me as somewhat far-fetched at any
rate it gives to these birds a formidable air and though the current
belief in its power of breaking a mans arm with a blow from its wing is
probably unwarranted an angry swan disturbed on its nest is an
awesome apparition of which I have twice taken hurried leave on the
first occasion I had nothing but a valuable camera with me and it was
in fact after a futile attempt to photograph the bird on the nest that
I was moved to seek the boat and push off from the little island in the
upper thames on which it had its home the other encounter was on a
devonshire trout stream and my only weapon was a fragile trout rod the
certainty that discretion is under these circumstances the better part
of valour is emphasised by the knowledge that any violence to the bird
would probably lead to a prosecution even the smaller geese can inspire
fear when they dash hissing at intruders hence no doubt the
nursemaids favourite reproach of children too frightened to say bo to
a goose an expression made classical by swift

the majority of these waterfowl are insectivorous in the nursery stage
and vegetarian when full grown fish forms an inappreciable portion of
their food with the two notorious exceptions of the goosander and
merganser though anglers are much exercised over the damage real or
alleged done by these birds to their favourite roach and dace in the
thames these swans belong for the most part to either the crown or the
dyers and vintners companies and the practice of uppings which
consists in marking the beaks of adult birds and pinioning the cygnets
is still though shorn of some of its former ceremonial observed some
time during the month of june

swans like both of the other groups are distinguished by a separate
name for either sex: pen and cob for the swan gander and goose drake
and duck and the figurative use of some of these terms in such popular
sayings as making ducks and drakes of money sauce for the goose
etc is too familiar to call for more than passing mention

nearly all these waterfowl though seen on dry land to much the same
disadvantage as fish out of water are exceedingly graceful in either
air or water though not all ducks are as capable of diving as the name
would imply the proverbial futility of a wild goose chase recognises
the pace of these birds on the wing which though in common with that
of some other birds popularly exaggerated is considerably faster than
owing to their short wings and heavy build might appear to the careless
observer

ducks have a curious habit of adding down to the nest after the eggs are
laid and before incubation and this provision of warm packing is turned
to account in iceland and other breeding places of the eider duck
commercially the most valuable of all ducks the nest is robbed of this
down once before the eggs hatch out with the result that the female
plucks another store from her own breast supplemented if necessary from
the body of the drake the sitting bird is then left in peace till the
nest has fulfilled its purpose when the remaining down is likewise
removed this down which combines warmth and lightness gives a high
market value to the eider which throughout scandinavian countries is
strictly protected by law and even more effectually by public opinion

the majority of ornamental ducks interbreed freely in captivity those
who apparently on reliable evidence distinguish between the polygamous
habit in tame ducks and the constancy of the mallard and other wild
kinds to a single mate have hastily assumed that such hybrids are
unknown in the natural state this however is incorrect as there have
been authentic cases of crosses between mallard and teal pochard and
scaup and other species such hybrids having at different times been
erroneously accepted as distinct species and named accordingly

the wild ducks nest is usually placed on the ground in some sheltered
spot close to still or running water and the ducklings swim like corks
soon learning the proper use of their flat little bills in gobbling up
floating insects and other waterlogged food occasionally ducks nest in
trees and they have been known to take possession of a deserted rooks
nest there has been some discussion as to whether in this case the
mother conveys her ducklings to the water in her bill but this has not
actually been witnessed in cases where as is often observed the nest
overhangs the water it has been suggested that the young birds may
simply be pushed over the edge and allowed to parachute down to the
surface as they might easily do without risk

tame ducks are among the most sociable of birds and can even display
bravery when threatened by a common enemy the naturalist houssay once
learnt this as the result of a somewhat cruel experiment that the made in
order to ascertain whether ducks invariably as alleged fall upon a
wounded comrade and destroy it wishing to satisfy himself on the point
houssay having come upon some ducks in a small pond deliberately
pelted them with stones till the had wounded one of their number
instead however of behaving as the had been led to expect the rest of
the ducks formed close order round the wounded bird and sheltered it
from further harm

few domestic animals none possibly with the single exception of the
camel are less suggestive of pets than such gross poultry yet even a
gander the most vicious tempered of them all has been known to show
lasting gratitude for an act of kindness the bird which had long been
the terror of children in the little devonshire village near which it
lived managed one day to get wedged in a drain and there it would
eventually have died unseen if a passing labourer had not seen its
plight and set it at liberty down to the day of its death the bird
though nowise relinquishing its spiteful attitude towards others
followed its rustic benefactor about the place like a dog

the robin redbreast




the robin redbreast


of all the old proverbs that are open to argument few offer more
material for criticism than that which has it that a good name is more
easily lost than won and if ever a living creature served to illustrate
the converse to the proverbial dog with a bad name that creature is the
companionable little bird that we peculiarly associate with christmas
traditionally the robin is a gentle little fellow of pious associations
and with a tender fancy for covering the unburied dead with leaves but
in real life the is a little fire-eater always ready to pick a quarrel
with his less pugnacious neighbours yet so persistently does his good
name cling that while ever ready to condemn the aggressive sparrow for
the same fault all of us have a good word for the robin and in few of
our wild birds are character and reputation so divergent

surely however the most interesting aspect of this familiar bird is
its tameness not to say attachment to ourselves and so marked is its
complete absence of fear that it is a wild bird in name only and
indeed few cage birds are ever so bold as to perch on the gardeners
spade on the look-out for the worms as the turns them up from the damp
soil the robin might in fact furnish the text of a lay-sermon on the
fruits of kindness to animals and those dialectical people who ask
whether we are kind to the robin because it trusts us or whether on
the other hand it trusts us because we are kind to it ask a foolish
question that raises a wholly unnecessary confusion between cause and
effect it is a question that those at any rate who have seen the bird
in countries where it is treated differently will have no difficulty
whatever in answering broadly speaking the redbreast has the best time
of it in northern lands this tolerance has not as has been suggested
any connection with protestantism for such a distinction would exclude
the greater part of ireland where as it happens the bird is as safe
from persecution as in britain since the superstitious peasants firmly
believe that anyone killing a spiddog will be punished by a lump
growing on the palm of his hand the untoward fate of the robin in latin
countries bordering the mediterranean has nothing to do with religion
but is merely the result of a pernicious habit of killing all manner of
small birds for the table the sight of rows of dead robins laid out on
poulterers stalls in the markets of italy and southern france inspires
such righteous indignation in british tourists as to make them forget
for the moment that larks are exposed in the same way in bond street and
at leadenhall in italy and provence taught by sad experience the robin
is as shy as any other small bird it has learnt its lesson like the
robins in the north but the lesson is different the most friendly
robin I ever remember meeting with out of england was in a garden
attached to a café in trebizond where hopping round my chair and
picking up crumbs it made me feel curiously at home similar treatment
of other wild birds would in time produce the same result and even the
suspicious starling and stand-off rook might be taught to forget their
fear of us the robin feeding less on fruit and grain than on worms and
insects has not made an enemy of the farmer or gardener the common
too common sparrow is another fearless neighbour but its freedom
from persecution of late somewhat threatened by sparrow clubs is due
less to affection than to the futility of making any impression on such
hordes as infest our streets

no act of the robins more forcibly illustrates its trust in man than
the manner in which at a season when all animals are abnormally shy and
suspicious it makes its nest not only near our dwellings but actually
in many cases under the same roof as ourselves letterboxes flowerpots
old boots and bookshelves have all done duty and I even remember a
pair of robins many years ago in kent bringing up two broods in an old
rat trap which fortunately too rusty to act was still set and baited
with a withered piece of bacon pages might be filled with the mere
enumeration of curious and eccentric nesting sites chosen by this
fearless bird but a single proof of its indifference to the presence of
man during the time of incubation may be cited from the ms notebooks of
the second earl of malmesbury which I have read in the library at heron
court it seems that while the east wing of that pleasant mansion was
being built a pair of robins having successfully brought up one family
in one of the unfinished rooms actually reared a second brood in a hole
made for a scaffold-pole though the sitting bird being immediately
beneath a plank on which the plasterers stood at work was repeatedly
splashed with mortar the egg of the robin is subject to considerable
variety of type I think it was the late lord lilford who speaking on
the subject of a bill for the protection of wild birds eggs then
before the house of lords gave it as his belief that no ornithologist
of repute would swear to the name of a single british birds egg without
positively seeing one or other of the parent birds fly off the nest
this was perhaps a little overstating the difficulty of evidence
since any schoolboy with a fancy for birds-nesting might without
hesitation identify such pronounced types as those of the chaffinch
with its purple blotches the song-thrush with its black spots on a blue
ground or the nightingale which resembles a miniature olive eggs on
the other hand like those of the house sparrow redshank and some of
the smaller warblers are so easily confused with those of allied
species that lord lilfords caution is by no means superfluous
ordinarily speaking the robins egg is white with red spots at one
end but I remember taking at bexley nearly thirty years ago an
immaculate one of coffee colour as the robin is a favourite
foster-parent with cuckoos my first thought was that this might be an
unusually small egg of the parasitic bird which was very plentiful
thereabouts it so happened however that three days after I had
abstracted the first and only egg I took from that nest there was a
second of the same type and much as I would have liked this also for
my collection I left it in the nest so as to set all doubts at rest my
moderation was rewarded for no one else found the nest and in due
course the coffee-coloured egg produced a robin like the rest

the robin is anything but a gregarious bird its fighting temper
doubtless leads it to keep its own company and we rarely see more than
one singing on the same bush or seeking for food on the same lawn yet
though it is with us all the year it is known to perform migrations
within these islands and possibly also overseas chiefly connected with
commissariat difficulties and it is probable that on such occasions
many robins may travel in company though I have not been so fortunate
as to come across them in their pilgrimage equally interesting
however is the habit which the bird has in devonshire of occasionally
going down to the rocks on the seashore as I have often noticed in the
neighbourhood of teignmouth and torquay what manner of food the
redbreast may find in such surroundings is a mystery but there it
certainly spends some of its time bobbing at the edge of the rock pools
in much the same fashion as the dipper on inland waters

young robins are turned adrift at an early age to look after themselves
a result of the parent bird always rearing two families in the year and
in many cases even three so that they have not too much time to devote
to the upbringing of each another consequence of this prolific habit is
that the robin has to make its nest earlier than most of our wild birds
and its nest has in fact been found near torquay during the first week
of january

it has long been the pardonable fancy of englishmen exiled to new homes
under the palms or pines in the scorching tropical sun or in the biting
northern blast to misname all manner of conspicuous birds after
well-remembered kinds left at home in the woods and fields of the old
country as might be expected of a bird so characteristic of english
scenes and so closely associated with the festival that always brings
nostalgia to the emigrant the robin has its share of these namesakes
and several of them bear little likeness to the original in new south
wales I remember being shown a robin which though perhaps a little
smaller was not unlike our own bird but the robin that was pointed
out to me in the states from maine to carolina was as big as a thrush
yet it had the red breast by which particularly conspicuous against a
background of snow this popular little bird is always recognisable the
male as well as the female indeed to all outward appearance the sexes
are absolutely alike a striking contrast to the cock and hen pheasant
the first bird dealt with in these notes as this is the last



there were six of us and we had the entire hotel I may almost say the
entire valley to ourselves if the verdict of the villagers could have
been taken we should perhaps have been voted a queer set familiar as
dwellers in franconia are with the sight of idle tourists 

    rapid and gay as if the earth were air
     and they were butterflies to wheel about
     long as the summer lasted

we were neither rapid nor gay and it was still only the first week
of june if we were summer boarders therefore we must be of some
unusual early-blooming variety

first came a lady in excellent repute among the savants of europe and
america as an entomologist but better known to the general public as a
writer of stories with her as companion and assistant was a doctor of
laws who is also a newspaper proprietor a voluminous author an art
connoisseur and many things beside they had turned their backs thus
unseasonably upon the metropolis and in this pleasant out-of-the-way
corner were devoting themselves to one absorbing pursuit the pursuit
of moths on their daily drives two or three insect nets dangled
conspicuously from the carriage the footman thrifty soul was never
backward to take a hand and evening after evening the hotel piazza was
illuminated till midnight with lamps and lanterns while these
enthusiasts waved the same white nets about gathering in geometries
noctuids sphinges and heaven knows what else all of them to perish
painlessly in numerous cyanide bottles which bestrewed the piazza by
night and happy thought the closed piano by day in this noble
occupation I sometimes played at helping but with only meagre success
my most brilliant catch being nothing more important than a beautiful
io the kind-hearted lepidopterist lingered with gracious emphasis upon
the adjective and assured me that the specimen would be all the more
valuable because of a finger-mark which my awkwardness had left upon one
of its wings so to the credit of human nature be it spoken so does
amiability sometimes get the better of the feminine scientific spirit
to the credit of human nature I say for though her practice of the
romancers art may doubtless have given to this good lady some peculiar
flexibility of mind some special individual facility in subordinating
a lower truth to a higher it surely may be affirmed also of humanity
in general that few things become it better than its inconsistencies

of the four remaining members of the company two were botanists and
two for the time ornithologists but the botanists were lovers of
birds also and went nowhere without opera-glasses while the
ornithologists in turn did not hold themselves above some elementary
knowledge of plants and amused themselves with now and then pointing
out some rarity sedges and willows were the special desiderata which
the professional collectors seemed in danger of passing without notice
all in all we _were_ a queer set how the latin and greek polysyllables
flew about the dining-room as we recounted our forenoons or
afternoons discoveries somebody remarked once that the waiters heads
appeared to be more or less in danger but if the waiters trembled at
all it was probably not for their own heads but for ours

 just how far the cause of science was advanced by all this activity
I am not prepared to say the first ornithologist of the party published
some time ago in _the auk_ vol v p  a list of our franconia
birds and the results of the botanists researches among the willows
have appeared in part at least in different numbers of the _bulletin
of the torrey botanical club_ as for the lepidopterist I have an
indistinct recollection that she once wrote to me of having made some
highly interesting discoveries among her franconia collections several
undescribed species as well as I can now remember but she added that
it would be useless to go into particulars with a correspondent
entomologically so ignorant

our first excursion I speak of the four who traveled on foot was to
the franconia notch it could not well have been otherwise at all
events there was one of the four whose feet would not willingly have
carried him in any other direction the mountains drew us and there was
no thought of resisting their attraction

love and curiosity are different if not incompatible sentiments and
the birds that are dearest to the man are for that very reason not
most interesting to the ornithologist when on a journey I am almost
without eyes or ears for bluebirds and robins song sparrows and
chickadees now is my opportunity for extending my acquaintance and
such every-day favorites must get along for the time as best they can
without my attention so it was here in franconia the vesper sparrow
the veery and a host of other friends were singing about the hotel and
along the roadside but we heeded them not our case was like the boys
who declined gingerbread when on a visit: the had plenty of that at
home

when we were nearly at the edge of the mountain woods however we heard
across the field a few notes that brought all four of us to an instant
standstill what warbler could that be nobody could tell in fact
nobody could guess but before the youngest of us could surmount the
wall the singer took wing flew over our heads far into the woods and
all was silent it was too bad but there would be another day
to-morrow meantime we kept on up the hill and soon were in the old
forest listening to bay-breasted warblers blackburnians black-polls
and so on while the noise of the mountain brook on our right a better
singer than any of them was never out of our ears you are going up
it said I wish you joy but you see how it is you will soon have to
come down again

I took leave of my companions at profile lake they having planned an
all-day excursion beyond and started homeward by myself slowly and
with many stops I sauntered down the long hill through the forest the
stops I need not say are commonly the major part of a naturalists
ramble the golden beads as it were the walk itself being only the
string till I reached the spot where we had been serenaded in the
morning by our mysterious stranger yes the was again singing this time
not far from the road in a moderately thick growth of small trees
under which the ground was carpeted with club-mosses dog-tooth
violets clintonia linnæa and similar plants the continued to sing
and I continued to edge my way nearer and nearer till finally I was
near enough and went down on my knees then I saw him facing me
showing white under parts a tennessee warbler here was good luck
indeed I ogled him for a long time shoot it says mr burroughs
authoritatively not ogle it with a glass but a man must follow his
own method impatient to see his back and especially the top of his
head what a precious frenzy we fall into at such moments my knees were
fairly upon nettles the flew and I followed once more the was under the
glass but still facing me how like a vireo the looked for one instant
I thought can it be the philadelphia vireo but though I had never
seen that bird I knew its song to be as different as possible from the
notes to which I was listening after a long time the fellow turned to
feeding and now I obtained a look at his upper parts the back olive
the head ashy like the nashville warbler that was enough it was
indeed the tennessee _helminthophila peregrina_ a bird for which i
had been ten years on the watch

the song which has not often been described is more suggestive of the
nashvilles than of any other but so decidedly different as never for a
moment to be confounded with it when you hear it a friend had said
to me several years before you will know it for something new it is
long I speak comparatively of course very sprightly and peculiarly
staccato and is made up of two parts the second quicker in movement
and higher in pitch than the first I speak of it as in two parts
though when my companions came to hear it as they did the next day
they reported it as in three we visited the place together afterwards
and the discrepancy was readily explained as to pitch the song _is_ in
three parts but as to rhythm and character it is in two the first
half being composed of double notes the second of single notes the
resemblance to the nashvilles song lies entirely in the first part the
notes of the concluding portion are not run together or jumbled after
the nashvilles manner but are quite as distinct as those of the
opening measure

as there were at least two pairs of the birds and they were
unmistakably at home we naturally had hope of finding one of the nests
we made several random attempts and one day I devoted an hour or more
to a really methodical search but the wily singer gave me not the
slightest clue behaving as if there were no such thing as a birds nest
within a thousand miles and all my endeavors went for nothing

as might have been foreseen franconia proved to be an excellent place
in which to study the difficult family of flycatchers all our common
eastern massachusetts species were present the kingbird the phoebe
the wood pewee and the least flycatcher and with them the crested
flycatcher not common the olive-sided the traill and the
yellow-bellied the phoebe-like cry of the traill was to be heard
constantly from the hotel piazza the yellow-bellied seemed to be
confined to deep and rather swampy woods in the valley and to the
mountain-side forests being most numerous on mount lafayette where it
ran well up toward the limit of trees in his notes the yellow-belly
may be said to take after both the least flycatcher and the wood pewee
his _killic_ so written in the books and I do not know how to improve
upon it resembles the _chebec_ of the least flycatcher though much
less emphatic as well as much less frequently uttered while his
_twee_ or _tuwee_ is quite in the voice and manner of the wood pewees
clear plaintive whistle usually a monosyllable but at other times
almost or quite dissyllabic the olive-sided on the other hand
imitates nobody or if the does it must be some bird with which I have
yet to make acquaintance _que-qúe-o_ the vociferates with a strong
emphasis and drawl upon the middle syllable this is his song or what
answers to a song but I have seen him when the would do nothing but
repeat incessantly a quick trisyllabic call _whit whit whit_
corresponding I suppose to the well-known _whit_ with which the
phoebe sometimes busies himself in a similar manner

of more interest than any flycatcher of more interest even than the
tennessee warbler was a bird found by the roadside in the village
after we had been for several days in the place three of us were
walking together talking by the way when all at once we halted as by
a common impulse at the sound of a vireo song a red-eyes song as it
seemed with the faintest touch of something unfamiliar about it the
singer was in a small butternut-tree close upon the sidewalk and at
once afforded us perfectly satisfactory observations perching on a low
limb within fifteen feet of our eyes and singing again and again while
we scrutinized every feather through our glasses as one of my
companions said it was like having the bird in your hand there was no
room for a question as to its identity at last we had before us the
rare and long-desired philadelphia greenlet as its song is little
known I here transcribe my notes about it made at two different times
between which there appears to have been some discussion among us as to
just how it should be characterized: 

the song is very pretty and is curiously compounded of the red-eyes
and the solitarys both as to phrase and quality the measures are all
brief with fewer syllables that is to say than the red-eye commonly
uses some of them are exactly like the red-eyes while others have
the peculiar sweet upward inflection of the solitarys to hear some of
the measures you would pass the bird for a red-eye to hear others of
them you might pass him for a solitary at the same time the has not
the most highly characteristic of the solitarys phrases his voice is
less sharp and his accent less emphatic than the red-eyes and so far
as we heard the observes decidedly longer rests between the measures

this is under date of june th on the following day I made another
entry: 

the song is I think less varied than either the solitarys or the
red-eyes but it grows more distinct from both as it is longer heard
acquaintance will probably make it as characteristic and unmistakable as
any of our four other vireo songs but I do not withdraw what I said
yesterday about its resemblance to the red-eyes and the solitarys the
bird seems quite fearless and keeps much of the time in the lower
branches in this latter respect his habit is in contrast with that of
the warbling vireo

on the whole then the song of the philadelphia vireo comes nearest to
the red-eyes differing from it mainly in tone and inflection rather
than in form in these two respects it suggests the solitary vireo
though it never reproduces the indescribably sweet cadence the real
dying fall of that most delightful songster at the risk of a seeming
contradiction however I must mention one curious circumstance on
going again to franconia a year afterwards and naturally keeping my
ears open for _vireo philadelphicus_ I discovered that I was never for
a moment in doubt when I heard a red-eye but once on listening to a
distant solitary catching only part of the strain I was for a little
quite uncertain whether the might not be the bird for which I was
looking how this fact is to be explained I am unable to say it will be
least surprising to those who know most of such matters and at all
events I think it worth recording as affording a possible clue to some
future observer the experience inconsistent as the assertion may
sound does not in the least alter my opinion that the philadelphias
song is practically certain to be confused with the red-eyes rather
than with the solitarys upon that point my companions and I were
perfectly agreed while we had the bird before us and mr brewsters
testimony is abundantly conclusive to the same effect the was in the
umbagog forests on a special hunt for philadelphia vireos the had
collected specimens there on two previous occasions and after some
days of fruitless search discovered almost by accident that the birds
had all the while been singing close about him but in every instance
had passed for nothing but red-eyes

 _bulletin of the nuttall ornithological club_ vol v p 

for the benefit of the lay reader I ought perhaps to have explained
before this that the philadelphia vireo is in coloration an exact copy
of the warbling vireo there is a slight difference in size between the
two but the most practiced eye could not be depended upon to tell them
apart in a tree _vireo philadelphicus_ is in a peculiar case: it looks
like one common bird and sings like another it might have been
invented on purpose to circumvent collectors as the almighty has been
supposed by some to have created fossils on purpose to deceive ungodly
geologists it is not surprising therefore that the bird escaped the
notice of the older ornithologists in fact it was first
described by mr cassin in  from a specimen taken nine years
before near philadelphia and its nest remained unknown for more than
thirty years longer the first one having been discovered apparently in
canada in

day after day the bare sharp crest of mount lafayette silently invited
my feet then came a bright favorable morning and I set out I would
go alone on this my first pilgrimage to the noble peak at which always
from too far off I had gazed longingly for ten summers it is not
inconsistent with a proper regard for ones fellows I trust to enjoy
now and then being without their society it _is_ good sometimes for a
man to be alone especially on a mountain-top and more especially at a
first visit the trip to the summit was some seven or eight miles in
length and an almost continual ascent without a dull step in the whole
distance the tennessee warbler was singing but perhaps the pleasantest
incident of the walk to the profile house in front of which the
mountain footpath is taken was a blackburnian warbler perched as
usual at the very top of a tall spruce his orange throat flashing fire
as the faced the sun and his song as my notebook expresses it sliding
up to high _z_ at the end in his quaintest and most characteristic
fashion I spent nearly three hours in climbing the mountain path and
during all that time saw and heard only twelve kinds of birds:
redstarts canada warblers near the base black-throated blues
black-throated greens nashvilles black-polls red-eyed vireos
snowbirds no white-throated sparrows winter wrens swainson and
gray-cheeked thrushes and yellow-bellied flycatchers black-poll and
nashville warblers were especially numerous as they are also upon mount
washington and as far as I have seen upon the white mountains
generally the feeble sharp song of the black-poll is a singular
affair short and slight as it is it embraces a perfect crescendo and a
perfect decrescendo without question I passed plenty of white-throated
sparrows but by some coincidence not one of them announced himself the
gray-cheeked thrushes which sang freely were not heard till I was
perhaps halfway between the eagle cliff notch and the eagle lakes this
species so recently added to our summer fauna proves to be not
uncommon in the mountainous parts of new england though apparently
confined to the spruce forests at or near the summits I found it
abundant on mount mansfield vermont in  and in the summer of 
mr walter faxon surprised us all by shooting a specimen on mount
graylock massachusetts doubtless the bird has been singing its
perfectly distinctive song in the white mountain woods ever since the
white man first visited them during the vernal migration indeed i
have more than once heard it sing in eastern massachusetts my latest
delightful experience of this kind was on the th of may last 
while I was hastening to a railway train within the limits of boston
preoccupied as I was and faintly as the notes came to me I recognized
them instantly for while the gray-cheeks song bears an evident
resemblance to the veerys which I had heard within five minutes the
two are so unlike in pitch and rhythm that no reasonably nice ear ought
ever to confound them the bird was just over the high close
inhospitable fence on the top of which I rested my chin and watched and
listened the sat with his back toward me in full view on a level with
my eye and sang and sang and sang in a most deliciously soft far-away
voice keeping his wings all the while a little raised and quivering as
in a kind of musical ecstasy it does seem a thing to be regretted yes
a thing to be ashamed of that a bird so beautiful so musical so
romantic in its choice of a dwelling-place and withal so characteristic
of new england should be known at a liberal estimate to not more than
one or two hundred new englanders but if a bird wishes general
recognition the should do as the robin does and the bluebird and the
oriole dress like none of his neighbors and show himself freely in
the vicinity of mens houses how can one expect to be famous unless he
takes a little pains to keep himself before the public

from the time I left my hotel until I was fairly above the dwarf spruces
below the summit of lafayette I was never for many minutes together out
of the hearing of thrush music four of our five summer representatives
of the genus _turdus_ took turns as it were in the serenade the
veeries wilsons thrushes greeted me before I stepped off the piazza
as I neared the profile house farm the hermits were in tune on either
hand the moment the road entered the ancient forest the olive-backs
began to make themselves heard and halfway up the mountain path the
gray-cheeks took up the strain and carried it on to its heavenly
conclusion a noble processional even a lame man might have climbed to
such music if the wood thrush had been here the chorus would have been
complete a chorus not to be excelled according to my untraveled
belief in any quarter of the world

to-day however my first thoughts were not of birds but of the
mountain the weather was all that could be asked the temperature
perfect and the atmosphere so transparent as to be of itself a kind of
lens so that in the evening when I rejoined my companions at the
hotel I found to my astonishment that I had been plainly visible while
at the summit the beholders having no other help than an opera-glass
it was almost past belief I had felt some dilation of soul it was
true but had been quite unconscious of any corresponding physical
transformation what would our aboriginal forerunners have said could
they have stood in the valley and seen a human form moving from point to
point along yonder sharp serrated ridge I should certainly have passed
for a god let us be thankful that all such superstitious fancies have
had their day the indian poor child of nature

    a pagan suckled in a creed outworn

stood afar off and worshiped toward these holy hills but the white man
clambers gayly up their sides guide-book in hand and leaves his
sardine box and eggshells and likely enough his business card at the
top let us be thankful I repeat for the light vouchsafed to us ours
is a goodly heritage but there are moods such creatures of hereditary
influence are we wherein I would gladly exchange both the guide-book
and the sardine box for a vision never so indistinct and transient of
kitche manitoo alas what a long time it is since any of us have been
able to see the invisible in the mountains says wordsworth did he
feel his faith but the poet was speaking then of a very old-fashioned
young fellow who even when the grew up made nothing but a peddler had
he lived in our day the would have felt not his faith but his own
importance especially if the had put himself out of breath as most
likely the would have done in accomplishing in an hour and forty minutes
what according to the guide-book should have taken a full hour and
three quarters the modern excursionist how wordsworth would have loved
that word has learned wisdom of a certain wise fowl who once taught
st peter a lesson and who never finds himself in a high place without
an impulse to flap his wings and crow

for my own part though I spent nearly three hours on the less than four
miles of mountain path as I have already acknowledged I was
nevertheless somewhat short-winded at the end so long as I was in the
woods it was easy enough to loiter but no sooner did I leave the last
low spruces behind me than I was seized with an importunate desire to
stand upon the peak so near at hand just above me I hope my readers
are none of them too old to sympathize with the boyish feeling at all
events I quickened my pace the distance could not be more than half a
mile I thought but it was wonderful how that perverse trail among the
boulders did unwind itself as if it never would come to an end and i
was not surprised on consulting a guide-book afterwards to find that
my half mile had really been a mile and a half ones sensations in such
a case I have sometimes compared with those of an essay-writer when he
is getting near the end of his task the dallied with it in the
beginning and was half ready to throw it up in the middle but now the
fever is on him and the cannot drive the pen fast enough two days ago
he doubted whether or not to burn the thing now it is certain to be his
masterpiece and the must sit up till morning if need be to finish it
what would life be worth without its occasional enthusiasm laughable in
the retrospect perhaps but in itself pleasurable almost to the point
of painfulness

it was a glorious day I enjoyed the climb the lessening forest the
alpine plants the diapensia was in full flower with its upright snowy
goblets while the geum and the greenland sandwort were just beginning
to blossom the magnificent prospect the stimulating air and most of
all the mountain itself I sympathized then as I have often done at
other times with a remark once made to me by a vermont farmers wife i
had sought a nights lodging at her house and during the evening we
fell into conversation about mount mansfield from the top of which i
had just come and directly at the base of which the farmhouse stood
when she went up the mounting she said she liked to look off of
course but somehow what she cared most about was the mounting itself

the woman had probably never read a line of wordsworth unless possibly
we are seven was in the old school reader but I am sure the poet
would have liked this saying especially as coming from such a source
_i_ liked it at any rate and am seldom on a mountain-top without
recalling it her lot had been narrow and prosaic bitterly so the
visitor was likely to think she was little used to expressing herself
and no doubt would have wondered what mr pater could mean by his talk
about natural objects as possessing more or less of a moral or
spiritual life as capable of a companionship with man full of
expression of inexplicable affinities and delicacies of intercourse
from such refinements and subtleties her mind would have taken refuge in
thoughts of her baking and ironing but she enjoyed the mountain i
think she had some feeling for it as for a friend and who knows but
she too was one of the poets that are sown by nature

I spent two happy hours and a half at the summit of lafayette the
ancient peak must have had many a worthier guest but it could never
have entertained one more hospitably with what softly temperate breezes
did it fan me I wish I were there now but kind as was its welcome it
did not urge me to remain the word of the brook came true again as
natures words always do if we hear them aright having gone as high as
my feet could carry me there was nothing left but to go down again
which things as paul said to the galatians are an allegory

I was not asked to stay but I was invited to come again and the next
season also in june I twice accepted the invitation on the first of
these occasions although I was eight days later than I had been the
year before june th instead of june th the diapensia was just
coming into somewhat free bloom while the sandwort showed only here and
there a stray flower and the geum was only in bud the dwarf paper
birch trees of no one knows what age matting the ground was in
blossom with large handsome catkins while cutlers willow was already
in fruit and the crowberry likewise the willow like the birch has
learned that the only way to live in such a place is to lie flat upon
the ground and let the wind blow over you the other flowers noted at
the summit were one of the blueberries _vaccinium uliginosum_
bigelows sedge and the fragrant alpine holy-grass _hierochloa
alpina_ why should this sacred grass which christians sprinkle in
front of their church doors on feast-days be scattered thus upon our
higher mountain-tops unless these places are indeed as the indian and
the ancient hebrew believed the special abode of the great spirit

but the principal interest of this my second ascent of mount lafayette
was to be not botanical but ornithological we had seen nothing
noteworthy on the way up I was not alone this time though I have so
far been rude enough to ignore my companion but while at the eagle
lakes on our return we had an experience that threw me into a nine
days fever the other man one of the botanists of last years
crew was engaged in collecting viburnum specimens when all at once i
caught sight of something red in a dead spruce on the mountain-side just
across the tiny lake I leveled my glass and saw with perfect
distinctness as I thought two pine grosbeaks in bright male
costume birds I had never seen before except in winter presently a
third one in dull plumage came into view having been hidden till now
behind the bole the trio remained in sight for some time and then
dropped into the living spruces underneath and disappeared I lingered
about while my companion and the black flies were busy and was on the
point of turning away for good when up flew two red birds and alighted
in a tree close by the one out of which the grosbeaks had dropped but
a single glance showed that they were not grosbeaks but white-winged
crossbills and soon they too were joined by a third bird in female
garb here was a pretty piece of confusion I was delighted to see the
crossbills having never before had the first glimpse of them summer or
winter but what was I to think about the grosbeaks your determination
is worthless said my scientific friend consolingly and there was no
gainsaying his verdict yet by what possibility could I have been so
deceived the birds though none too near had given me an excellent
observation and as long as they were in sight I had felt no uncertainty
whatever as to their identity the bill alone of which I had taken
particular note ought in all reason to be held conclusive so much for
one side of the case on the other hand however the second trio were
unmistakably crossbills they had been joined on the wing by several
others as I ought to have mentioned and with their characteristic
chattering cry had swept out of sight up the mountain it was certainly
a curious coincidence: three grosbeaks two males and a female had
dropped out of a tree into the undergrowth and then five minutes
later three crossbills two males and a female had risen out of the
same undergrowth and taken almost the very perch which the others had
quitted had this strange thing happened or had my eyes deceived me
this was my dilemma on the sharp horns of which I tried alternately for
the next eight days to make myself comfortable

during all that time the weather rendered mountain climbing
impracticable but the morning of the th was clear and cold and I set
out forthwith for the eagle lakes if the grosbeaks were there I meant
to see them though I should have to spend all day in the attempt my
botanist had returned home leaving me quite alone at the hotel but as
good fortune would have it before I reached the profile house I was
overtaken unexpectedly by a young ornithological friend who needed no
urging to try the lafayette path we were creeping laboriously up the
long steep shoulder beyond the eagle cliff gorge and drawing near the
lakes when all at once a peculiarly sweet flowing warble fell upon
our ears a pine grosbeak said I in a tone of full assurance
although this was my first hearing of the song the younger man plunged
into the forest in the direction of the voice while I knowing pretty
well how the land lay hastened on toward the lakes in hopes to find
the singer visible from that point just as I ran down the little
incline into the open a bird flew past me across the water and
alighted in a dead spruce it might have been the very tree of nine days
before where it sat in full sight and at once broke into song like
the purple finchs says my notebook less fluent but as it seemed
to me sweeter and more expressive I think it was not louder before
many minutes my comrade came running down the path in high glee
calling pine grosbeaks the had got directly under a tree in which two
of them were sitting so the momentous question was settled and i
commenced feeling once more a degree of confidence in my own eyesight
the loss of such confidence is a serious discomfort but strange as it
may seem to people in general I suspect that few field ornithologists
except beginners ever succeed in retaining it undisturbed for any long
time together as a class they have learned to take the familiar maxim
seeing is believing with several grains of allowance with most of
them it would be nearer the mark to say shooting is believing

my special errand at the lakes being thus quickly disposed of there was
no reason why I should not accompany my friend to the summit lafayette
gave us a cold reception we might have addressed him as daniel webster
according to the time-worn story once addressed mount washington but
neither of us felt oratorically inclined in truth after the outrageous
heats of the past few days it seemed good to be thrashing our arms and
crouching behind a boulder while we devoured our luncheon and between
times studied the landscape for my own part I experienced a feeling of
something like wicked satisfaction as if I had been wronged and all at
once had found a way of balancing the score the diapensia was already
quite out of bloom although only nine days before we had thought it
hardly at its best it is one of the prettiest and most striking of our
strictly alpine plants but is seldom seen by the ordinary summer
tourist as it finishes its course long before the arrives the same may
be said of the splendid lapland azalea which I do not remember to have
found on mount lafayette it is true but which is to be seen in all its
glory upon the mount washington range in middle or late june so early
that one may have to travel over snow-banks to reach it the two flowers
oftenest noticed by the chance comer to these parts are the greenland
sandwort the mountain daisy and the pretty geum with its handsome
crinkled leaves and its bright yellow blossoms like buttercups

my sketch will hardly fulfill the promise of its title for our june in
franconia included a thousand things of which I have left myself no room
to speak: strolls in the landaff valley and to sugar hill a walk to
mount agassiz numerous visits by the way and in uncertain weather to
bald mountain several jaunts to lonesome lake and wanderings here and
there in the pathless valley woods we were none of us of that unhappy
class who cannot enjoy doing the same thing twice

I wished also to say something of sundry minor enjoyments: of the
cinnamon roses for example with the fragrance of which we were
continually greeted and which have left such a sweetness in the memory
that I would have called this essay june in the valley of cinnamon
roses had I not despaired of holding myself up to so poetic a title
and with the roses the wild strawberries present themselves roses and
strawberries it is the very poetry of science that these should be
classified together the berries like the flowers are of a generous
turn it is a family trait I think loving no place better than the
roadside as if they would fain be of refreshment to beings less happy
than themselves who cannot be still and blossom and bear fruit but are
driven by the fates to go trudging up and down in dusty highways for
myself if I were a dweller in this vale I am sure my finger-tips would
never be of their natural color so long as the season of strawberries
lasted on one of my solitary rambles I found a retired sunny field
full of them to judge from appearances not a soul had been near it
but I noticed that while the almost ripe fruit was abundant there was
scarce any that had taken on the final tinge and flavor then I began to
be aware of faint sibilant noises about me and glancing up I saw
that the ground was already preëmpted by a company of cedar-birds
who naturally enough were not a little indignant at my poaching thus
on their preserves they showed so much concern and had gathered the
ripest of the berries so thoroughly that I actually came away the
sooner on their account I began to feel ashamed of myself and for once
in my life was literally hissed off the stage

even on my last page I must be permitted a word in praise of mount
cannon of which I made three ascents it has nothing like the celebrity
of mount willard with which from its position it is natural to
compare it but to my thinking it is little if at all less worthy its
outlook upon mount lafayette is certainly grander than anything mount
willard can offer while the prospect of the pemigewasset valley fading
away to the horizon if less striking than that of the white mountain
notch has some elements of beauty which must of necessity be lacking
in any more narrowly circumscribed scene no matter how romantic

in venturing upon a comparison of this kind however one is bound
always to allow for differences of mood when I am in tune for such
things I can be happier on an ordinary massachusetts hilltop than at
another time I should be on any new hampshire mountain though it were
moosilauke itself and truly fortune did smile upon our first visit to
mount cannon weather conditions outward and inward were right we had
come mainly to look at lafayette from this point of vantage but while
we suffered no disappointment in that direction we found ourselves
still more taken with the valley prospect we lay upon the rocks by the
hour gazing at it scattered clouds dappled the whole vast landscape
with shadows the river winding down the middle of the scene drew the
whole into harmony as it were making it in some nobly literal sense
picturesque while the distance was of such an exquisite blue as I think
I never saw before

how good life is at its best and in such

                charmëd days
    when the genius of god doth flow

what care we for science or the objects of science for grosbeak or
crossbill may the birds forgive me or the latest novelty in willows
I am often where fine music is played and never without being
interested as men say I am pleased but at the twentieth time it may
be something touches my ears and I hear the music within the music
and for the hour I am at heavens gate so it is with our appreciation
of natural beauty we are always in its presence but only on rare
occasions are our eyes anointed to see it such ecstasies it seems are
not for every day sometimes I fear they grow less frequent as we grow
older

we will hope for better things but should the gloomy prognostication
fall true we will but betake ourselves the more assiduously to lesser
pleasures to warblers and willows roses and strawberries science
will never fail us if worse comes to worst we will not despise the
moths




december out-of-doors

    decembers as pleasant as may
                            _old hymn_


for a month so almost universally spoken against november commonly
brings more than its full proportion of fair days and last year 
this proportion was I think even greater than usual on the st and
th I heard the peeping of hylas sunday the th was enlivened by a
farewell visitation of bluebirds during the first week at least four
sorts of butterflies disippus philodice antiopa and comma were on
the wing and a single philodice our common yellow butterfly was
flying as late as the th wild flowers of many kinds not less than a
hundred certainly were in bloom among them the exquisite little
pimpernel or poor mans weather-glass my daily notes are full of
complimentary allusions to the weather once in a while it rained and
under date of the th I find this record everybody complaining of
the heat but as terrestrial matters go the month was remarkably
propitious up to the th then all without warning unless possibly
from the pimpernel which nobody heeded a violent snow-storm descended
upon us railway travel and telegraphic communication were seriously
interrupted while from up and down the coast came stories of shipwreck
and loss of life winter was here in earnest for the next three months
good walking days would be few

december opened with a mild gray morning the snow had already
disappeared leaving only the remains of a drift here and there in the
lee of a stone-wall the ground was saturated with water every meadow
was like a lake and but for the greenness of the fields in a few
favored spots the season might have been late march instead of early
december of course such hours were never meant to be wasted within
doors so I started out singing as I went 

    while god invites how blest the day

but the next morning was pleasant likewise and the next and still the
next and so the story went on till in the end omitting five days of
greater or less inclemency I had spent nearly the entire month in the
open air I could hardly have done better had I been in florida

all my neighbors pronounced this state of things highly exceptional
many were sure they had never known the like at the time I fully agreed
with them now however looking back over my previous years notes i
come upon such entries as these: december d the day has been warm
found chickweed and knawel in bloom and an old garden was full of
fresh-looking pansies th a calm warm morning th warm and
rainy th mild and bright th a most beautiful winter day mild
and calm th even milder and more beautiful than yesterday th
weather very mild since last entry pickering hylas peeping to-day
th still very warm hylas peeping in several places th warm
and bright th if possible a more beautiful day than yesterday

so much for december  its unexpected good behavior would seem to
have made a profound impression upon me no doubt I promised never to
forget it yet twelve months later traditionary notions had resumed
their customary sway and every pleasant morning took me by surprise

the winter of - will long be famous in the ornithological annals
of new england as the winter of killdeer plovers I have mentioned the
great storm of november th-th on the first pleasant morning
afterwards on the th that is my out-of-door comrade and I made an
excursion to nahant the land-breeze had already beaten down the surf
and the turmoil of the waters was in great part stilled but the beach
was strewn with sea-weeds and eel-grass and withal presented quite a
holiday appearance from one motive and another a considerable
proportion of the inhabitants of the city had turned out the principal
attraction as far as we could perceive was a certain big clam of
which great numbers had been cast up by the tide baskets and wagons
were being filled some of the men carried off shells and all while
others with a celerity which must have been the result of much
practice were cutting out the plump dark bodies leaving the shells in
heaps upon the sand the collectors of these molluscan dainties knew
them as quahaugs and esteemed them accordingly but my companion a
connoisseur in such matters pronounced them not the true quahaug
_venus mercenaria_ what a profanely ill-sorted name even for a
bivalve but the larger and coarser _cyprina islandica_ the man to
whom we imparted this precious bit of esoteric lore received it like a
gentleman if I cannot add like a scholar we _call_ them quahaugs he
answered with an accent of polite deprecation as if it were not in the
least to be wondered at that the should be found in the wrong it was
evident at the same time that the question of a name did not strike
him as of any vital consequence _venus mercenaria_ or _cyprina
islandica_ the savoriness of the chowder was not likely to be seriously
affected

it was good I thought to see so many people out-of-doors most of them
had employment in the shops probably and on grounds of simple economy
so called would have been wiser to have stuck to their lasts but man
after all that civilization has done for him and against him remains
at heart a child of nature his ancestors may have been shoemakers for
fifty generations but none the less the feels an impulse now and then to
quit his bench and go hunting though it be only for a mess of clams

leaving the crowd we kept on our way across the beach to little nahant
the cliffs of which offer an excellent position from which to sweep the
bay in search of loons old-squaws and other sea-fowl here we
presently met two gunners they had been more successful than most of
the sportsmen that one falls in with on such trips between them they
had a guillemot two horned larks and a brace of large plovers of some
species unknown to us but noticeable for their bright cinnamon-colored
rumps why couldnt _we_ have found those plovers instead of that
fellow said my companion as we crossed the second beach I fear he
was envious at the prosperity of the wicked but it was only a passing
cloud for on reaching the main peninsula we were speedily arrested by
loud cries from a piece of marsh and after considerable wading and a
clamber over a detestable barbed-wire fence such as no rambler ever
encountered without at least a temptation to profanity we caught sight
of a flock of about a dozen of the same unknown plovers this was good
fortune indeed we had no firearms nor even a pinch of salt and coming
shortly to a ditch too wide for leaping and too deep for cold-weather
fording we were obliged to content ourselves with opera-glass
inspection six of the birds were grouped in a little plot of grass
standing motionless like so many robins their novelty and their
striking appearance with two conspicuous black bands across the breast
their loud cries and their curious movements and attitudes were enough
to drive a pair of enthusiasts half crazy we looked and looked and
then reluctantly turned away on getting home we had no difficulty in
determining their identity and each at once sent off to the other the
same verdict killdeer plover

this as I say was on the th of november on the d of december we
were again at nahant eating our luncheon upon the veranda of some rich
mans deserted cottage and at the same time enjoying the sunshine and
the beautiful scene

it was a summery spot moths were flitting about us and two
grasshoppers leaped out of our way as we crossed the lawn they showed
something less than summer liveliness it is true it was only
afterwards and by way of contrast that I recalled leigh hunts

    green little vaulter in the sunny grass
     catching his heart up at the feel of june

but they had done well surely to weather the recent snow-storm and the
low temperature for the mercury had been down to ° within a
fortnight and a large snow-bank was still in sight against the wall
suddenly a close flock of eight or ten birds flew past us and
disappeared behind the hill pigeons said my companion I thought
not they were sea-birds of some kind soon we heard killdeer cries from
the beach and looking up saw the birds three of them alighting on
the sand we started down the hill in haste but just at that moment an
old woman a miserable gatherer of drift rubbish walked directly upon
them and they made off then we saw that our pigeons or sea-birds
had been nothing but killdeer plovers which like other long-winged
birds look much larger in the air than when at rest returning towards
lynn later in the afternoon we came upon the same three birds again
this time feeding among the boulders at the end of the beach we
remarked once more their curious silly-looking custom of standing
stock-still with heads indrawn but our own attitudes as we also stood
stock-still with glasses raised may have looked in their eyes even
more singular and meaningless as we turned away after flushing them
two or three times to get a view of their pretty cinnamon
rump-feathers a sportsman came up and proved to be the very man on
whose belt we had seen our first killdeers a week before we left him
doing his best to bag these three also the will never read what I write
and I need not scruple to confess that seeing his approach we
purposely startled the birds as badly as possible hoping to see them
make off over the hill out of harms way but the foolish creatures
could not take the hint and alighted again within a few rods at the
same time calling loudly enough to attract the attention of the gunner
who up to this moment had not been aware of their presence the fired
twice before we got out of sight but to judge from his motions
without success a mans happiness is perhaps of more value than a
plovers though I do not see how we are to prove it but my sympathies
then as always were with the birds

within a week or so I received a letter from mrs celia thaxter
together with a wing a foot and one cinnamon feather by this wing
which I send you she began can you tell me the name of the bird that
owned it then after some description of the plumage she continued:
in the late tremendous tempest myriads of these birds settled on the
isles of shoals filling the air with a harsh shrill incessant cry
and not to be driven away by guns or any of mans inhospitable
treatment their number was so great as to be amazing and they had
never been seen before by any of the present inhabitants of the shoals
they are plovers of some kind I should judge but I do not know on
the th she wrote again: all sorts of strange things were cast up by
the storm and the plovers were busy devouring everything they could
find always running chasing each other very quarrelsome fighting
all the time they were in poor condition so lean that the men did not
shoot them after the first day a fact which gives your correspondent
great satisfaction they are still there my brother came from the
shoals yesterday and says that the place is alive with them all the
seven islands

similar facts were reported as I began in one way and another to
learn from different points along the coast especially from cape
elizabeth maine where hundreds of the birds were seen on the th and
th of november the reporter of this item pertinently adds: such a
flight of killdeer in maine where the bird is well known to be
rare has probably not occurred before within the memory of living
sportsmen here as at the isles of shoals the visitors were at first
easily shot they are not counted among game birds where they are known
on account of their habitual leanness I suppose but they had landed
upon inhospitable shores and were not long in becoming aware of their
misfortune in the middle of december one of our cambridge
ornithologists went to cape cod on purpose to find them the saw about
sixty birds but by this time they were so wild that the succeeded in
getting only a single specimen poor fellows the wrote me they
looked unhappy enough that cold friday with the mercury at ° and
everything frozen stiff most of them were on hillsides and in the
hollows of pastures a few were in the salt marshes and one or two on
the beach nobody expected them to remain hereabouts as they normally
winter in the west indies and in central and south america but every
little while mrs thaxter wrote the killdeers are still here and on
the st of december as I approached marblehead neck I saw a bird
skimming over the ice that covered the small pond back of the beach i
put up my glass and said to myself a killdeer plover there proved to
be two birds they would not suffer me within gunshot though I carried
no gun but flew off into some ploughed ground with their usual loud
vociferations the killdeer is aptly named _Ægialitis vocifera_

 mr n c brown in _the auk_ january  page 

 it seems probable that the birds started from some point in the
southern states for a long southward flight or perhaps for the west
indies on the evening of november th and on getting out to sea were
caught by the great gale which whirled them northward over the
atlantic landing them such of them that is as were not drowned on
the way upon the coast of new england the grounds for such an opinion
are set forth by dr arthur p chadbourne in _the auk_ for july 
page 

during the month with the history of which we are now especially
concerned I saw nothing more of them but by way of completing the
story I may add that on the th of january in the same spot I found a
flock of seven and there they remained I visited them four times in
february and once in march and found them invariably in the same place
evidently they had no idea of making another attempt to reach the west
indies for _this_ season and if they were to remain in our latitude
they could hardly have selected a more desirable location the marsh or
meadow was sheltered and sunny while the best protected corner was at
the same time one of those peculiarly springy spots in which the grass
keeps green the winter through here then these seven wayfarers
stayed week after week whenever I stole up cautiously and peeped over
the bank into their verdant hiding-place I was sure to hear the
familiar cry and directly one bird and then another and another
would start up before me disclosing the characteristic brown feathers
of the lower back they commonly assembled in the middle of the marsh
upon the snow or ice where they stood for a little bobbing their heads
in mutual conference and then flew off over the house and over the
orchard calling as they flew

throughout december and indeed throughout the winter brown creepers
and red-bellied nuthatches were surprisingly abundant every pine wood
seemed to have its colony of them whether the extraordinary mildness of
the season had anything to do with this I cannot say but their presence
was welcome whatever the reason for it like the chickadee with whom
they have the good taste to be fond of associating they are always busy
and cheerful appearing not to mind either snow-storm or low
temperature no reasonable observer would ever tax them with effeminacy
though the creeper it must be owned cannot speak without lisping

following my usual practice I began a catalogue of the months birds
and at the end of a fortnight discovered to my astonishment that the
name of the downy woodpecker was missing the had been common during
november and is well known as one of our familiar winter residents i
began forthwith to keep a sharp lookout for him particularly whenever i
went near any apple orchard a little later I actually commenced making
excursions on purpose to find him but the fates were against me and go
where I would the was not there at last I gave him up then on the
th as I sat at my desk a chickadee chirped outside of course i
looked out to see him and there exploring the branches of an old
apple-tree directly under my window was the black-and-white woodpecker
for whom I had been searching in vain through five or six townships the
saucy fellow the rapped smartly three or four times then he
straightened himself back as woodpeckers do and said: good-morning
sir where have you been so long if you wish to see _me_ you had
better stay at home the might have spoken a little less pertly for
after all if a man would know what is going on whether in summer or
winter the must not keep too much in his own door-yard of the thirty
birds in my december list I should have seen perhaps ten if I had sat
all the time at my window and possibly twice that number had I confined
my walks within the limits of my own town

while the migration is going on to be sure one may find birds in the
most unexpected places last may I glanced up from my book and espied an
olive-backed thrush in the back yard foraging among the currant-bushes
raising a window quietly I whistled something like an imitation of his
inimitable song and the little traveler always an easy dupe pricked
up his ears and presently responded with a strain which carried me
straight into the depths of a white mountain forest but in december
with some exceptions of course birds must be sought after rather than
waited for the th for example was a most uncomfortable day so
uncomfortable that I stayed indoors the mercury only two or three
degrees above zero and a strong wind blowing such weather would drive
the birds under shelter the next forenoon therefore I betook myself
to a hill covered thickly with pines and cedars here I soon ran upon
several robins feeding upon the savin berries and in a moment more was
surprised by a _tseep_ so loud and emphatic that I thought at once of a
fox sparrow then I looked for a song sparrow badly startled
perhaps but found to my delight a white-throat the was on the ground
but at my approach flew into a cedar here the drew in his head and sat
perfectly still the picture of discouragement I could not blame him
but was glad an hour later to find him again on the ground picking up
his dinner I leveled my glass at him and whistled his peabody song the
simplest of all bird songs to imitate but the moved not a feather
apparently the had never heard it before the was still there in the
afternoon and I had hopes of his remaining through the winter but i
never could find him afterwards ten days prior to this I had gone to
longwood on a special hunt for this same sparrow remembering a certain
peculiarly cozy hollow where six or eight years before a little
company of song sparrows and white-throats had passed a rather severe
winter the song sparrows were there again as I had expected but no
white-throats the song sparrows by the way treated me shabbily this
season a year ago several of them took up their quarters in a roadside
garden patch where I could look in upon them almost daily this year
there were none to be discovered anywhere in this neighborhood they
figure in my december list on four days only and were found in four
different towns brookline longwood marblehead nahant and
cohasset like some others of our land birds notably the golden-winged
woodpecker and the meadow lark they seem to have learned that winter
loses a little of its rigor along the sea-board

three kinds of land birds were met with at nahant beach and nowhere
else: the ipswich sparrow on the d and th the snow bunting and
the horned lark of the last two species both of them rather common in
november I saw but one individual each they were feeding side by
side and after a short separation under the fright into which my
sudden appearance put them one called to the other and they flew off
in company towards lynn it was a pleasing display of sociability but
nothing new for in winter as every observer knows birds not of a
feather flock together the ipswich sparrow a very retiring but not
peculiarly timid creature I have now seen at nahant in every one of our
seven colder months from october to april though it is
unquestionably rare upon the massachusetts coast between the fall and
spring migrations besides the species already named my monthly list
included the following: herring gull great black-backed gull ruffed
grouse hairy woodpecker flicker goldfinch tree sparrow snowbird
blue jay crow shrike white-bellied nuthatch only two or three
birds golden-crowned kinglet and one small hawk

 to this list my ornithological comrade before mentioned added seven
species namely: white-winged scoter barred owl cowbird purple finch
white-winged crossbill fox sparrow and winter wren between us as far
as land birds went we did pretty well

the only birds that sang during the month unless we include the
red-bellied nuthatches whose frequent quaint twitterings should
perhaps come under this head were the chickadees and a single robin
the former I have down as uttering their sweet phoebe whistle which i
take to be certainly their song as distinguished from all their
multifarious calls on seven of the thirty-one days they were more
tuneful in january and still more so in february so that the titmouse
as becomes a creature so full of good humor and high spirits may fairly
be said to sing all winter long the robins music was a pleasure quite
unexpected I was out on sunday the th for a few minutes stroll
before breakfast when the obliging stranger I had not seen a robin for
a fortnight and did not see another for nearly two months broke into
song from a hill-top covered with pitch-pines the was in excellent
voice and sang again and again the morning invited music warm and
cloudless like an unusually fine morning in early april

for an entire week indeed the weather had seemed to be trying to outdo
itself I remember in particular the day before christmas I rose long
before daylight crossed the mystic river marshes as the dawn was
beginning to break and shortly after sunrise was on my way down the
south shore leaving the cars at cohasset I sauntered over the
jerusalem road to nantasket spent a little while on the beach and
brought up at north cohasset where I was attracted by a
lonesome-looking road running into the woods all by itself with a
guide-board marked turkey hill why not accept the pleasing
invitation which seemed meant on purpose for just such an idle
pedestrian as myself as for turkey hill I had never heard of it and
presumed it to be some uninteresting outlying hamlet my concern as a
saunterers ought always to be was with the road itself not with what
might lie at the end of it I did not discover my mistake till I had
gone half a mile more or less when the road all at once turned sharply
to the right and commenced ascending then it dawned upon me that turkey
hill must be no other than the long gradual grassy slope at which i
had already been looking from the railway station the prospect of sea
and land was beautiful all the more so perhaps because of a thick
autumnal haze it might be called excellent christmas weather I said to
myself when a naturally prudent man no longer young could sit perched
upon a fence rail at the top of a hill drinking in the beauties of the
landscape

at the station after my descent I met a young man of the neighborhood
do you know why they call that turkey hill said I no sir i
dont the answered I suggested that probably somebody had killed a
wild turkey up there at some time or other the looked politely
incredulous I dont _think_ there are any wild turkeys up there said
he _i_ never saw any the was not more than twenty-five years old and
the last massachusetts turkey was killed on mount tom in  so that i
had no doubt the spoke the truth probably the took me for a simple-minded
fellow while I thought nothing worse of him than that the was one of
those people so numerous and at the same time so much to be pitied who
have never studied ornithology

the th was warmer even than the th and it likewise I spent upon
the south shore though at a point somewhat farther inland and in a
town where I was not likely to lose myself least of all in any
out-of-the-way woodland road in short I spent christmas on my native
heath a not inappropriate word by the bye for a region so largely
grown up to huckleberry bushes holbrooks meadows and norton
pasture the names are not to be found on any map and will convey no
meaning to my readers but in my ears they awaken memories of many and
many a sunny hour on this holiday I revisited them both warm as it
was boys and girls were skating on the meadows in spite of their name
these have been nothing but a pond for as long as I can remember and i
stood awhile by the old ross cellar watching their evolutions how
bright and cheery it was in the little sheltered clearing with nothing
in sight but the leafless woods and the ice-covered pond shant I take
your coat the sun seemed to be asking at my elbow stood a bunch of
lilac bushes laylocks they were probably called by the man who set
them out that had blossomed freely in the summer the house has
been gone for these thirty years or more alas my sun must be rapidly
declining when memory casts so long a shadow but the bushes seem
likely to hold their own for at least a century they might have
prompted a wise man to some wise reflections but for myself it must be
acknowledged I fell instead to thinking how many half days I had
fished and caught nothing or next to nothing along this same
pleasant willow-bordered shore

 so they were called too by that lover of flowers walter savage
landor who as his biographer says followed a pronunciation
traditional in many old english families

in norton pasture an hour or two later I made myself young again by
putting a few checkerberries into my mouth and in a small new clearing
just over the brook dyers run this used to be called but I fear
the name is falling into forgetfulness I stumbled upon a patch of some
handsome evergreen shrub which I saw at once to be a novelty I took it
for a member of the heath family but it proved to belong with the
hollies _ilex glabra_ or ink-berry a plant not to be found in the
county where it is my present lot to botanize so even on my native
heath I had discovered something new

the flora of a massachusetts december is of necessity limited even in
the month under review singularly favorable as it was I found but
sixteen sorts of wild blossoms a small number surely though perhaps
larger by sixteen than the average reader would have guessed the names
of these hardy adventurers must by no means go unrecorded: shepherds
purse wild pepper-grass pansy common chickweed _stellaria media_
mouse-ear chickweed _cerastium viscosum_ knawel common mallow
witch-hazel cinque-foil _potentilla norvegica_ not _argentea_ as i
should certainly have expected many-flowered aster cone-flower
yarrow two kinds of groundsel fall dandelion and jointweed six of
these mallow cinque-foil aster cone-flower fall dandelion and
jointweed were noticed only at nahant and it is further to be said
that the jointweed was found by a friend not by myself while the
cone-flower was not in strictness a blossom that is to say its rays
were well opened making what in common parlance is called a flower but
the true florets were not yet perfected such witch-hazel blossoms as
can be gathered in december are of course nothing but belated specimens
I remarked a few on the d and again on the th and on the afternoon
of christmas happening to look into a hamamelis-tree I saw what looked
like a flower near the top the tree was too small for climbing and
almost too large for bending but I managed to get it down and sure
enough the bit of yellow was indeed a perfectly fresh blossom how did
it know I was to pass that way on christmas afternoon and by what sort
of freemasonry did it attract my attention I loved it and left it on
the stalk in the true emersonian spirit and here I do my little best
to embalm its memory

one of the groundsels _senecio viscosus_ is a recent immigrant from
europe but has been thoroughly established in the back bay lands of
boston where I now found it in perfect condition december th for at
least half a dozen years in grays flora of north america it is said
to grow there and in the vicinity of providence but since that account
was written it has made its appearance in lowell and probably in other
places it is a coarse-looking little plant delighting to grow in pure
gravel but its blossoms are pretty and now with not another flower of
any sort near it it looked as the homely phrase is as handsome as a
picture its more generally distributed congener _senecio
vulgaris_ also a foreigner is next to the common chickweed I should
say our very hardiest bloomer at the beginning of the month it was in
flower in an old garden in melrose and at marblehead neck a
considerable patch of it was fairly yellow with blossoms all through
december and january and I know not how much longer I saw no
shepherds purse after december th but knawel was in flower as late
as january th the golden-rods it will be observed are absent
altogether from my list and the same would have been true of the
asters but for a single plant this curiously enough still bore five
heads of tolerably fresh blossoms after all its numberless companions
growing upon the same hillside had succumbed to the frost

of my sixteen plants exactly one half are species that have been
introduced from europe six are members of the composite family and if
we omit the cone-flower all but three of the entire number are simple
whites and yellows two red flowers the clover and the pimpernel
disappointed my search but the blue hepatica would almost certainly
have been found had it come in my way to look for it

prettier even than the flowers however was the december greenness
especially of the humbler sorts: st johns-wort five-finger the
creeping blackberries whose modest winter loveliness was never half
appreciated herb-robert corydalis partridge-berry checkerberry
wintergreen rattlesnake-plantain veronica and linnæa to say nothing
of the ferns and mosses most refreshing of all perhaps was an
occasional patch of bright green grass like the one already spoken of
at marblehead or like one even brighter and prettier which I visited
more than once in swampscott

as I review what I have written I am tempted to exclaim with
tennyson: 

    and was the day of my delight
     as pure and perfect as I say

but I answer in all good conscience yes the motto with which I began
states the truth somewhat strongly perhaps it must be remembered where
I got it but aside from that one bit of harmless borrowed hyperbole i
have delivered a plain unvarnished tale for all that however I do
not expect my industrious fellow-citizens to fall in at once with my
opinion that winter is a pleasant season at the seashore it would be
too bad they should as far as my own enjoyment is concerned and
december a month propitious for leisurely all-day rambles how foreign
such notions are to people in general I have lately had several forcible
reminders on one of my jaunts from marblehead to swampscott for
example I had finally taken to the railway and was in the narrow
tortuous cut through the ledges when looking back I saw a young
gentleman coming along after me the was in full skating rig fur cap and
all with a green bag in one hand and a big hockey stick in the other i
stopped every few minutes to listen for any bird that might chance to be
in the woods on either hand and the could not well avoid overtaking me
though the seemed little desirous of doing so the spot was lonesome
and as the went by and until the was some rods in advance the kept his
head partly turned there was no mistaking the significance of that
furtive sidelong glance the had read the newspapers and didnt intend
to be attacked from behind unawares if the should ever cast his eye over
these pages and whatever the may have thought of my appearance I am
bound to say of him that the looked like a man who might appreciate good
literature the will doubtless remember the incident especially if i
mention the field-glass which I carried slung over one shoulder
evidently the world sees no reason why a man with anything better to do
should be wandering aimlessly about the country in midwinter nor do i
quarrel with the worlds opinion the majority is wiser than the
minority of course otherwise what becomes of its divine and
inalienable right to lay down the law the truth with me was that i
_had_ nothing better to do I confess it without shame surely there is
no lack of shoemakers why then should not here and there a man take
up the business of walking of wearing out shoes everything is related
to everything else and the self-same power that brought the killdeers
to marblehead sent me there to see them and do them honor should it
please the gods to order it so I shall gladly be kept running on such
errands for a score or two of winters




dyers hollow

                      quiet hours
    passd among these heaths of ours
    by the grey atlantic sea
                       matthew arnold


I lived for three weeks at the castle though unhappily I did not
become aware of my romantic good fortune till near the close of my stay
there was no trace of battlement or turret nothing in the least
suggestive of warwick or windsor or of sir walter scott in fact the
castle was not a building of any kind but a hamlet a small collection
of houses a somewhat scattered collection it must be owned such as
on the bleaker and sandier parts of cape cod is distinguished by the
name of village on one side flowed the river doubling its course
through green meadows with almost imperceptible motion as I watched the
tide come in I found myself saying 

    here twice a day the pamet fills
       the salt sea-water passes by

but the rising flood could make no silence in the hills for the
pamet as I saw it is far too sedate a stream ever to be caught
babbling it has only some three miles to run and seems to know
perfectly well that it need not run fast

my room would have made an ideal study for a lazy man I thought the
two windows facing straight into a sand-bank above which rose a steep
hill or perhaps I should rather say the steep wall of a plateau on
whose treeless top all by themselves or with only a graveyard for
company stood the town hall and the two village churches perched thus
upon the roof of the cape as it were and surmounted by cupola and
belfry the hall and the orthodox church made invaluable beacons
visible from far and near in every direction for three weeks I steered
my hungry course by them twice a day having all the while a pleasing
consciousness that however I might skip the sunday sermon I was by no
means neglecting my religious privileges the second and smaller
meeting-house belonged to a methodist society on its front were the
scars of several small holes which had been stopped and covered with
tin a resident of the castle assured me that the mischief had been done
by pigeon woodpeckers flickers a statement at which I inwardly
rejoiced long ago I had announced my belief that these enthusiastic
shouters must be of the wesleyan persuasion and here was the proof
otherwise why had they never sought admission to the more imposing and
as I take it more fashionable orthodox sanctuary yes the case was
clear I could understand now how darwin and men like him must have felt
when some great hypothesis of theirs received sudden confirmation from
an unexpected quarter at the same time I was pained to see that the
flickers attempts at church-going had met with such indifferent
encouragement probably the minister and the class leaders would have
justified their exclusiveness by an appeal to that saying about those
who enter not by the door into the sheepfold while the woodpeckers
on their part might have retorted that just when they had most need to
go in the door was shut

one of my favorite jaunts was to climb this hill or plateau the hill
of storms I am still ignorant whether the storms in question were
political ecclesiastical or atmospheric but I approve the name and
go down on the other side into a narrow valley whose meanderings led me
to the ocean beach this valley or to speak in the local dialect this
hollow like the parallel one in which I lived the valley of the
pamet runs quite across the cape from ocean to bay a distance of two
miles and a half more or less

at my very first sight of dyers hollow I fell in love with it and now
that I have left it behind me perhaps forever I foresee that my
memories of it are likely to be even fairer and brighter than was the
place itself I call it dyers hollow upon the authority of the town
historian who told me if I understood him correctly that this was its
name among sailors to whom it is a landmark by the residents of the
town I commonly heard it spoken of as longnook or pikes hollow but for
reasons of my own I choose to remember it by its nautical designation
though myself as far as possible from being a nautical man

to see dyers hollow at its best the visitor should enter it at the
western end and follow its windings till the stands upon the bluff
looking out upon the atlantic if his sensations at all resemble mine
he will feel long before the last curve is rounded as if the were
ascending a mountain and an odd feeling it is the road being level or
substantially so for the whole distance at the outset the is in a
green well-watered valley on the banks of what was formerly little
harbor the building of the railway embankment has shut out the tide
and what used to be an arm of the bay is now a body of fresh water
luxuriant cat-tail flags fringe its banks and cattle are feeding near
by up from the reeds a bittern will now and then start I should like
to be here once in may to hear the blows of his stake-drivers mallet
echoing and reëchoing among the close hills at that season too all
the uplands would be green so we were told at any rate though the
pleasing story was almost impossible of belief in august as soon as we
left the immediate vicinity of little harbor the very bottom of the
valley itself was parched and brown and the look of barrenness and
drought increased as we advanced till toward the end as the last
houses were passed the total appearance of things became subalpine:
stunted weather-beaten trees and broad patches of bearberry showing at
a little distance like beds of mountain cranberry

all in all dyers hollow did not impress me as a promising farming
country acres and acres of horseweed pinweed stone clover poverty
grass reindeer moss mouse-ear everlasting and bearberry no wonder
such fields do not pay for fencing-stuff no wonder either that the
dwellers here should be mariculturalists rather than agriculturalists
and still although their best garden is the bay they have their
gardens on land also the bottoms of the deepest hollows being selected
for the purpose and by hook or by crook manage to coax a kind of
return out of the poverty-stricken soil even on cape cod there must be
some potatoes to go with the fish vegetables raised under such
difficulties are naturally sweet to the taste and I was not so much
surprised therefore on a certain state occasion at the castle to see
a mighty dish of string beans ladled into soup-plates and exalted to the
dignity of a separate course here too but this was in dyers
hollow I found in successful operation one of the latest and if i
may venture an unprofessional opinion one of the most valuable
improvements in the art of husbandry an old man an ancient mariner no
doubt was seated on a camp-stool and plying a hoe among his cabbages
he was bent nearly double with age triple is the word in my notebook
but that may have been an exaggeration and had learned wisdom with
years I regretted afterward that I had not got over the fence and
accosted him I could hardly have missed hearing something rememberable
yet I may have done wisely to keep the road industry like his ought
never to be intruded upon lightly some I dare say would have called
the sight pathetic to me it was rather inspiring only a day or two
before in another part of the township I had seen a man sitting in a
chair among his bean-poles picking beans those heavy sandy roads and
steep hills must be hard upon the legs and probably the dwellers
thereabout unlike the lombardy poplars which there as elsewhere were
decaying at the top begin to die at the lower extremities it was not
many miles from dyers hollow that thoreau fell in with the old wrecker
a regular cape cod man of whom the says that the looked as if he
sometimes saw a doughnut but never descended to comfort quite
otherwise was it with my wise-hearted agricultural economists and quite
otherwise shall it be with me also who mean to profit by their
example if I am compelled to dig when I get old to beg may I ever be
ashamed I am determined not to forget the camp-stool the cape cod
motto shall be mine the that hoeth cabbages let him do it with
assiduity

 in looking over the town history I was pleased to come upon a note
in defense of this lowly plant on the score not only of its beauty but
of its usefulness in holding the sand in place but alas all men have
not faith and where the historian wrote _hudsonia tomentosa_ the
antipathetic compositor set up _hudsonia tormentosa_ that compositor
was a cape cod man I would wager a dinner upon it thus the whirligig
of time brings in his revenges I hear him mutter as the slips the
superfluous consonant into its place

this aged cultivator not so much on his last legs as beyond them was
evidently a native of the soil but several of the few houses standing
along the valley road were occupied by western islanders I was crossing
a field belonging to one of them when the owner greeted me a milkman
as it turned out proud of his cows and of his boy his only child how
old do you think the is the asked pointing to the young fellow it
would have been inexcusable to disappoint his fatherly expectations and
I guessed accordingly: seventeen or eighteen sixteen he
rejoined sixteen and his face shone till I wished I had set the
figure a little higher the additional years would have cost me nothing
and there is no telling how much happiness they might have conferred
who lives there I inquired turning to a large and well-kept house in
the direction of the bay my nephew did the come over when you did
no I sent for him the himself left the azores as a cabin boy landed
here on cape cod and settled down since then the had been to
california where the worked in the mines ah that was where you got
rich was it said I rich this in a tone of sarcasm but the added
well I made something his praise of his nearest neighbor whose
name proclaimed his cape cod nativity made me think well not only of
his neighbor but of him there were forty-two portuguese families in
truro the said there are more than that in provincetown I suggested
he shrugged his shoulders yes about half the people and pretty good
people they are if such as I saw were fair representatives one boy of
fourteen unlike the milkmans heir the was very small for his years as
he told me with engaging simplicity walked by my side for a mile or
two and quite won my heart a true nathanael the seemed in whom was no
guile the should never go to sea the said nor was the ever going to get
married so long as his father lived the loved his father so much and he
was the only boy and his father couldnt spare him but didnt your
father go to sea oh yes both my fathers went to sea that was a
puzzle but presently it came out that his two fathers were his father
and his grandfather the looked troubled for a moment when I inquired the
whereabouts of the poorhouse in the direction of which we happened to
be going the entertained a very decided opinion that the shouldnt like
to live there a wholesome aversion I am bound to maintain dear uncle
venner to the contrary notwithstanding

a stranger was not an every-day sight in dyers hollow I imagine and
as I went up and down the road a good many times in the course of my
visit I came to be pretty well known so it happened that a western
islands woman came to her front door once broom in hand and the
sweetest of smiles on her face and said thank you for that five cents
you gave my little boy the other day put that in your pocket I had
said and the obedient little man did as the was bidden without so much
as a side glance at the denomination of the coin but the forgot one
thing and when his mother asked him as of course she did for mothers
are all alike did you thank the gentleman the could do nothing but
hang his head hence the womans smile and thank you which made me so
ashamed of the paltriness of the gift thackeray never saw a boy without
wanting to give him a _sovereign_ that my mention of the matter here
so far from indicating an ostentatious spirit ought rather to be taken
as a mark of humility

all things considered I should hardly choose to settle for life in
dyers hollow but with every recollection of the place I somehow feel
as if its score or two of inhabitants were favored above other men why
is it that people living thus by themselves and known thus transiently
and from the outside as it were always seem in memory like dwellers in
some land of romance I cannot tell but so it is and whoever has such
a picture on the wall of his mind will do well perhaps never to put
the original beside it yet I do not mean to speak quite thus of dyers
hollow once more at least I hope to walk the length of that
straggling road as I think of it now I behold again those beds of
shining bearberry resplendent would be none too fine a word there is
no plant for which the sunlight does more loaded with a wealth of
handsome red fruit the beach-plum crop was a failure plum wine of the
goodness of which I heard enthusiastic reports would be scarce but one
needed only to look at the bearberry patches to perceive that cape cod
sand was not wanting in fertility after a manner of its own if its
energies in the present instance happened to be devoted to ornament
rather than utility it was not for an untaxed and disinterested
outsider to make complaint least of all a man who was never a
wine-bibber and who believes or thinks the believes in art for arts
sake within the woods the ground was carpeted with trailing arbutus
and a profusion of checkerberry vines the latter yielding a few fat
berries almost or quite a year old but still sound and spicy still
tasting like tooth-powder as the benighted city boy expressed it it
was an especial pleasure to eat them here in dyers hollow I had so
many times done the same in another place on the banks of dyers run
ladys-slippers likewise nothing but leaves looked homelike and
friendly and the wild lily of the valley too and the pipsissewa
across the road from the old house nearest the ocean stood a still more
ancient-seeming barn long disused to all appearance but with old
maids pinks catnip and tall stout pokeberry weeds yet flourishing
beside it old maids pinks and catnip could that combination have been
fortuitous

no botanist nor even a semi-scientific lover of growing things like
myself can ever walk in new fields without an eye for new plants while
coming down the cape in the train I had seen at short intervals
clusters of some strange flower like yellow asters I thought at
every station I jumped off the car and looked hurriedly for specimens
till after three or four attempts I found what I was seeking the
golden aster _chrysopsis falcata_ here in truro it was growing
everywhere and of course in dyers hollow another novelty was the pale
greenbrier _smilax glauca_ which I saw first on the hill at
provincetown and afterward discovered in longnook it was not abundant
in either place and in my eyes had less of beauty than its familiar
relatives the common greenbrier cat-brier horse-brier indian-brier
of my boyhood and the carrion flower this glaucous smilax was one of
the plants that attracted thoreaus attention if I remember right
though I cannot now put my finger upon his reference to it equally new
to me and much more beautiful as well as more characteristic of the
place were the broom-crowberry and the greener kind of poverty grass
_hudsonia ericoides_ inviting pillows or cushions of which looking
very much alike at a little distance were scattered freely over the
grayish hills these huddling low-lying plants were among the things
which bestowed upon longnook its pleasing and remarkable mountain-top
aspect the rest of the vegetation was more or less familiar I believe:
the obtuse-leaved milkweed of which I had never seen so much before
three sorts of goldenrod including abundance of the fragrant _odora_
two kinds of yellow gerardia and in the lower lands at the western end
of the valley the dainty rose gerardia just now coming into bloom the
pretty _polygala polygama_ pretty but not in the same class with the
rose gerardia ladies tresses bayberry sweet fern crisp-leaved
tansy beach grass huckleberry bushes for whose liberality I had
frequent occasion to be thankful bear oak chinquapin chokeberry a
single vine of the virginia creeper wild carrot wild cherry the
common brake these and doubtless many more were there for I made no
attempt at a full catalogue there must have been wild roses along the
roadside and on the edge of the thickets I should think yet I cannot
recollect them nor does the name appear in my penciled memoranda had
the month been june instead of august notebook and memory would record
a very different story I can hardly doubt but out of flower is out of
mind

in the course of my many visits to dyers hollow I saw thirty-three
kinds of birds of the eighty-four species in my full truro list the
number of individuals was small however and except at its lower end
the valley was or appeared to be nearly destitute of feathered life a
few song sparrows a cat-bird or two a chewink or two a field sparrow
and perhaps a maryland yellow-throat might be seen above the last
houses but as a general thing the bushes and trees were deserted
walking here I could for the time almost forget that I had ever owned a
hobby-horse but farther down the hollow there was one really birdy
spot to borrow a word useful enough to claim lexicographical
standing from one of my companions: a tiny grove of stunted oaks by
the roadside just at the point where I naturally struck the valley
when I approached it by way of the hill of storms here I happened upon
my only cape cod cowbird a full-grown youngster who was being
ministered unto in the most devoted manner by a red-eyed vireo such a
sight as always fills me with mingled amusement astonishment
admiration and disgust that any bird should be so befooled and imposed
upon here too I saw at different times an adult male blue
yellow-backed warbler and a bird of the same species in immature
plumage it seemed highly probable to say the least that the young
fellow had been reared not far off the more so as the neighboring
wellfleet woods were spectral with hanging lichens of the sort which
this exquisite especially affects at first I wondered why this
particular little grove by no means peculiarly inviting in appearance
should be the favorite resort of so many birds robins orioles wood
pewees kingbirds chippers golden warblers black-and-white creepers
prairie warblers red-eyed vireos and blue yellow-backs but i
presently concluded that a fine spring of water just across the road
must be the attraction near the spring was a vegetable garden and
here on the d of august I suddenly espied a water thrush teetering
upon the tip of a bean-pole his rich olive-brown back glistening in the
sunlight the soon dropped to the ground among the vines and before long
walked out into sight his action when the saw me was amusing instead of
darting back as a sparrow for instance would have done the flew up to
the nearest perch that is to the top of the nearest bean-pole which
happened to be a lath wood is one of the precious metals on cape cod
and if oars are used for fence-rails and fish-nets for hen-coops why
not laths for bean-poles the perch was narrow but wide enough for the
birds small feet four times the came up in this way to look about him
and every time alighted thus on the top of a pole at the same moment
three prairie warblers were chasing each other about the garden now
clinging to the side of the poles now alighting on their tips it was a
strange spot for prairie warblers as it seemed to me though they
looked still more out of place a minute later when they left the
bean-patch and sat upon a rail fence in an open grassy field cape cod
birds like cape cod men know how to shift their course with the wind
where else would one be likely to see prairie warblers black-throated
greens and black-and-white creepers scrambling in company over the red
shingles of a house-roof and song sparrows singing day after day from a
chimney-top

in all my wanderings in dyers hollow only once did I see anything of
that pest of the seashore the sportsman then in the distance two
young fellows with a highly satisfactory want of success as well as i
could make out were trying to take the life of a meadow lark no doubt
they found existence a dull affair and felt the need of something to
enliven it a noble creature is man a little lower than the angels
two years in succession I have been at the seashore during the autumnal
migration of sandpipers and plovers two years in succession have I seen
men old and young murdering sandpipers and plovers at wholesale for
the mere fun of doing it had they been pot hunters seeking to earn
bread by shooting for the market I should have pitied them
perhaps certainly I should have regretted their work but I should
have thought no ill of them their vocation would have been as
honorable for aught I know as that of any other butcher but a man of
twenty a man of seventy shooting sanderlings ring plovers golden
plovers and whatever else comes in his way not for money nor
primarily for food but because the enjoys the work a little lower than
the angels what numbers of innocent and beautiful creatures have i
seen limping painfully along the beach after the gunners had finished
their days amusement even now I think with pity of one particular
turnstone some being made a little lower than the angels had fired at
him and carried away one of his legs I watched him for an hour much of
the time the stood motionless then the hobbled from one patch of
eel-grass to another in search of something to eat my heart ached for
him and it burns now to think that good men find it a pastime to break
birds legs and wings and leave them to perish I have seen an old man
almost ready for the grave who could amuse his last days in this way
for weeks together an exhilarating and edifying spectacle it
was this venerable worthy sitting behind his bunch of wooden decoys a
wounded tern fluttering in agony at his feet withal be it said the was
a man of gentlemanly bearing courteous and a christian the did not
shoot on sunday not the such sport is to me despicable yet it is
affirmed by those who ought to know by those that is who engage in
it that it tends to promote a spirit of manliness

but thoughts of this kind belong not in dyers hollow rather let me
remember only its stillness and tranquillity its innocent inhabitants
its gray hills its sandy road and the ocean at the end of the way
even at the western extremity near the railway and the busy harbor the
valley was the very abode of quietness here on one of my earlier
excursions I came unexpectedly to a bridge and on the farther side of
the bridge to a tidy house and garden and in the garden were several
pear-trees with fruit on them still more to my surprise here was a
little shop the keeper of it had also the agency of some insurance
company so a signboard informed the passer-by as for his stock in
trade sole leather dry goods etc that spoke for itself I stepped
inside the door but the was occupied with an account book and when at
last the looked up there was no speculation in his eyes possibly the had
sold something the day before and knew that no second customer could be
expected so soon we exchanged the time of day not a very valuable
commodity hereabout and I asked him a question or two touching the
hollow and especially the village of which I had heard a rumor that
it lay somewhere in this neighborhood the looked bewildered at the
word the hardly knew what I could mean the said but with a little
prompting the recollected that a few houses between this point and north
truro there used to be more houses than now but they had been removed
to other towns some of them to boston were formerly called the
village I left him to his ledger and on passing his house I saw that
he was a dealer in grain as well as in sole leather and calico and had
telephonic communication with somebody an enterprising merchant after
all up with the times in spite of appearances

the shop was like the valley a careless tourist might have said a
sleepy shop in sleepy hollow to me it seemed not so peaceful remote
sequestered these and all similar epithets suited well with longnook
but for myself in all my loitering there I was never otherwise than
wide awake the close-lying barren mountainous-looking hills did not
oppress the mind but rather lifted and dilated it and although I could
not hear the surf I felt all the while the neighborhood of the sea not
the harbor but the ocean with nothing between me and spain except that
stretch of water blessed forever be dyers hollow I say and blessed
be its inhabitants whether western islanders or regular cape cod men
may they live and die in peace




five days on mount mansfield

     and talk to him of things at hand and common
                                matthew arnold


I went up the mountain from the village of stowe in very ignoble
fashion in a wagon and was three hours on the passage one of the
hands at the summit house occupied the front seat with the driver and
we were hardly out of the village before a seasonable toothache put him
in mind of his pipe would smoking be offensive to me the inquired what
could I say having had an aching tooth before now myself it was a
pleasure almost beyond the luxury of breathing mountain air to see the
misery of a fellow-mortal so quickly assuaged the driver a sturdy
young vermonter was a man of different spirit the had never used
tobacco nor drunk a glass of liquor I heard him saying somebody had
once offered him fifty cents to smoke a cigar

why didnt you take it asked his companion in a tone of wonder

well im not that kind of a fellow to be bought for fifty cents

as we approached the base of the mountain a white-throated sparrow was
piping by the roadside

I love to hear that bird sing said the driver

it was now my turn to be surprised our man of principle was also a man
of sentiment

what do you call him I inquired as soon as I could recover myself

whistling jack the answered a new name to me and a good one it
would take a nicer ear than mine to discriminate with certainty between
a white-throats voice and a school-boys whistle

the morning had promised well but before we emerged from the forest as
we neared the summit we drove into a cloud and shortly afterward into
a pouring rain in the office of the hotel I found a company of eight
persons four men and four women drying themselves about the stove
they had left a village twenty miles away at two oclock that morning
in an open wagon for an excursion to the summit like myself they had
driven into a cloud and up to this time had seen nothing more distant
than the stable just across the road within a stones toss of the
window and even that only by glimpses one of the party was a doctor
who must be at home that night hour after hour they watched the clouds
or rather the rain we were so beclouded that the clouds could not be
seen and debated the situation finally at three oclock they got
into their open wagon the rain pelting them fiercely and started for
the base doubtless they soon descended into clear weather but not till
they were well drenched verily the clouds are no respecters of persons
it is nothing to them how far you have come nor how worthy your errand
so I reflected having nothing better to do when my wagonful of
pilgrims had dropped out of sight in the fog as a pebble drops into the
lake leaving me with the house to myself and presently as I sat at
the window I heard a white-throated sparrow singing outside here was
one at least whom the rain could not discourage a wild and yet a
sweet and home-felt strain is this of whistling jack a mountain
bird well used to mountain weather and just now too happy to forego
his music no matter how the storm might rage I myself had been in a
cloud often enough to feel no great degree of discomfort or lowness of
spirits I had not decided to spend the precious hours of a brief
vacation upon a mountain-top without taking into account the additional
risk of unfavorable weather in such a place let the clouds do their
worst I could be patient and wait for the sun but this whistling
philosopher outside spoke of something better than patience and i
thanked him for the timely word

toward noon of the next day the rain ceased the cloud vanished and i
made haste to clamber up the rocky peak the nose so called at the
base of which the hotel is situated yes there stretched lake
champlain visible for almost its entire length and beyond it loomed
the adirondacks I was glad I had come _i_ could sing now it does a
man good to look afar off

even before the fog lifted I had discovered to my no small
gratification that the evergreens immediately about the house were
full of gray-cheeked thrushes a close colony strictly confined to the
low trees at the top of the mountain they were calling at all hours
_yeep yeep_ somewhat in the manner of young chickens and after
supper as it grew dark I stood on the piazza while they sang in full
chorus at least six of them were in tune at once _wee-o wee-o tit-ti
wee-o_ something like this the music ran with many variations a most
ethereal sound at the very top of the scale but faint and sweet quite
in tune also with my mood for I had just come in from gazing long at
the sunset with lake champlain like a sea of gold for perhaps a hundred
miles and a stretch of the st lawrence showing far away in the north
during the afternoon too I had been over the long crest of the
mountain to the northern peak the highest point belittled in local
phraseology as the chin a delightful jaunt of two miles with
magnificent prospects all the way it was like walking on the ridge-pole
of vermont a truly exhilarating experience

all in all though the forenoon had been so rainy I had lived a long
day and now if ever could appreciate the singing of this
characteristic northern songster himself such a lover of mountains as
never to be heard here in new england at least and in summer-time
except amid the dwindling spruce forests of the upper slopes I have
never before seen him so familiar on the mount washington range and on
mount lafayette it is easy enough to hear his music but one rarely gets
more than a flying glimpse of the bird here as I say the was never out
of hearing and seldom long out of sight even from the door-step the
young were already leaving the nest and undoubtedly the birds had
disposed themselves for the season before the unpainted
inoffensive-looking little hotel showed any signs of occupancy the very
next year a friend of mine visited the place and could discover no trace
of them they had found their human neighbors a vexation perhaps and
on returning from their winters sojourn in costa rica or where not
had sought summer quarters on some less trodden peak

not so was it with the myrtle warblers I venture to assert though on
this point I have never taken my friends testimony perfectly at home
as they are in the wildest and most desolate places they manifest a
particular fondness for the immediate vicinity of houses delighting
especially to fly about the gutters of the roof and against the window
panes here at the summit house they were constantly to be seen
hawking back and forth against the side of the building as barn
swallows are given to doing in the streets of cities the rude structure
was doubly serviceable to me a shelter and to the birds a fly-trap i
have never observed any other warbler thus making free with human
habitations

this yellow-rump or myrtle bird is one of the thrifty members of his
great family and next to the black-poll is the most numerous
representative of his tribe in massachusetts during the spring and fall
migrations a beautiful little creature with a characteristic flight
and call and for a song a pretty trill suggestive of the snow-birds
within two or three years the has been added to the summer fauna of
massachusetts and as a son of the bay state I rejoice in his presence
and heartily bid him welcome we shall never have too many of such
citizens I esteem him also as the only one of his delicate
insectivorous race who has the hardihood to spend the winter sparingly
but with something like regularity within the limits of new england he
has a genius for adapting himself to circumstances picking up his daily
food in the depths of a mountain forest or off the panes of a
dwelling-house and wintering as may suit his fancy or convenience in
the west indies or along the sea-coast of massachusetts

one advantage of a sojourn at the summit of any of our wooded new
england mountains is the easy access thus afforded to the upper forest
while I was here upon mount mansfield I spent some happy hours almost
every day in sauntering down the road for a mile or two looking and
listening just after leaving the house it was possible to hear three
kinds of thrushes singing at once gray-cheeks olive-backs and
hermits of the three the hermit is beyond comparison the finest singer
both as to voice and tune his song given always in three detached
measures each higher than the one before it is distinguished by an
exquisite liquidity the presence of _d_ and _l_ I should say as
contrasted with the inferior _t_ sound of the gray-cheek if it has
less variety and perhaps less rapture than the song of the
wood-thrush it is marked by greater simplicity and ease and if it does
not breathe the ineffable tranquillity of the veerys strain it comes
to my ear at least with a still nobler message the hermits note is
aspiration rather than repose peace peace says the veery but the
hermits word is higher higher spiritual songs I call them both
with no thought of profaning the apostolic phrase

I had been listening to thrush music I think I could listen to it
forever and at a bend of the road had turned to admire the wooded side
of the mountain just here spread out before me miles and miles of
magnificent hanging forest when I was attracted by a noise as of
something gnawing a borer under the bark of a fallen spruce lying at my
feet such an industrious and contented sound no doubt the grub would
have said yes I could do _this_ forever what knew the of the
beauties of the picture at which I was gazing the very light with which
to see it would have been a torture to him heaven itself was under the
close bark of that decaying log so peradventure may we ourselves be
living in darkness without knowing it while spiritual intelligences
look on with wondering pity to see us so in love with our prison-house
well yonder panorama was beautiful to _me_ at all events however it
might look to more exalted beings and like my brother under the
spruce-tree bark I would make the best of life as I found it

this way my thoughts were running when all at once two birds dashed by
me a black-poll warbler in hot pursuit of an olive-backed thrush the
thrush alighted in a tree and commenced singing and the warbler sat by
and waited following the universal rule that a larger bird is never to
be attacked except when on the wing the thrush repeated his strain once
or twice and then flew to another tree the little fellow after him
with all speed again the olive-back perched and sang and again the
black-poll waited three times these manoeuvres were repeated before
the birds passed out of my range some wrong-doing real or fancied on
the part of the larger bird had excited the ire of the warbler why
should the be imposed upon simply because the was small the thrush
meantime disdaining to defend himself would only stop now and then to
sing as if to show to the world every creature is the centre of a
world that such an insect persecution could never ruffle his spirit
birds are to be commiserated perhaps on having such an excess of what
we call human nature but the misfortune certainly renders them the more
interesting to us who see our more amiable weaknesses so often
reflected in their behavior

for the sympathetic observer every kind of bird has its own temperament
on one of my jaunts down this mount mansfield road I happened to espy a
canada jay in a thick spruce the was on one of the lower branches but
pretty soon began mounting the tree keeping near the bole and going up
limb by limb in absolute silence exactly in the manner of our common
blue jay I was glad to see him but more desirous to hear his voice
the loud harsh scream with which the books credit him and which _a
priori_ I should have little hesitation in ascribing to any member of
his tribe I waited till I grew impatient then I started hastily
toward him making as much commotion as possible in pushing through the
undergrowth it was a clever scheme but the bird was not to be
surprised into uttering so much as an exclamation the dropped out of his
tree flew a little distance to a lower and less conspicuous perch and
there I finally left him once before on mount clinton I had seen him
and had been treated with the same studied silence and later I fell in
with a little family party on the side of mount washington and they
too refused me so much as a note probably I was too near the birds in
every case though in the third instance there was no attempt at
skulking nor any symptom of nervousness I have often been impressed
and amused by the blue jays habit in this respect no bird could well
be noisier than the when the noisy mood takes him but come upon him
suddenly at close quarters and the will be as still as the grave itself
he has a double gift of eloquence and silence silver and gold and no
doubt his canadian cousin is equally well endowed

the reader may complain perhaps that I speak only of trifles why go
to a mountain-top to look at warblers and thrushes I am not careful to
justify myself I love a mountain-top and go there because I love to be
there it is good I think to be lifted above the every-day level and
to enjoy the society and the absence of society which the heights
afford looking over my notes of this excursion I come upon the
following sentence: to sit on a stone beside a mountain road with
olive-backed thrushes piping on every side the ear catching now and
then the distant tinkle of a winter wrens tune or the nearer _zee
zee zee_ of black-poll warblers while white-throated sparrows call
cheerily out of the spruce forest this is to be in another world

this sense of distance and strangeness is not to be obtained in my case
at all events by a few hours stay in such a spot I must pitch my tent
there for at least a night or two I cannot even see the prospect at
first much less feel the spirit of the place there must be time for
the old life to drop off as it were while eye and ear grow wonted to
novel sights and sounds doubtless I did take note of trivial
things the call of a bird and the fragrance of a flower it was a
pleasing relief after living so long with men whose minds were all the
time full of those serious and absorbing questions what shall we eat
and what shall we drink and wherewithal shall we be clothed

I remember with special pleasure a profusion of white orchids
_habenaria dilatata_ which bordered the roadside not far from the top
their spikes of waxy snow-white flowers giving out a rich spicy odor
hardly to be distinguished from the scent of carnation pinks i
remember too how the whole summit from the nose to the chin was
sprinkled with the modest and beautiful greenland sandwort springing up
in every little patch of thin soil where nothing else would flourish
and blossoming even under the door-step of the hotel unpretending as it
is this little alpine adventurer makes the most of its beauty the
blossoms are not crowded into close heads so as to lose their
individual attractiveness like the florets of the golden-rod for
example nor are they set in a stiff spike after the manner of the
orchid just now mentioned at the same time the plant does not trust to
the single flower to bring it into notice it grows in a pretty tuft
and throws out its blossoms in a graceful loose cluster the eye is
caught by the cluster and yet each flower shows by itself and its own
proper loveliness is in no way sacrificed to the general effect how
wise too is the sandwort in its choice of a dwelling-place in the
valley it would be lost amid the crowd on the bare brown mountain-top
its scattered tufts of green and white appeal to all comers

to what extent if at all the sandwort depends upon the service of
insects for its fertilization I do not know but it certainly has no
scarcity of such visitors bees will soar for bloom high as the highest
peak of mansfield so runs an entry in my notebook with a pardonable
adaptation of wordsworths line and I was glad to notice that even the
splendid black-and-yellow butterfly _turnus_ which was often to be
seen sucking honey from the fragrant orchids did not disdain to sip
also from the sandworts cup this large and elegant butterfly our
largest is thoroughly at home on our new england mountains sailing
over the very loftiest peaks and making its way through the forests
with a strong and steady flight many a time have I taken a second look
at one as it has threaded the treetops over my head thinking to see a
bird besides the _turnus_ I noted here the nettle tortoise-shell
butterfly _vanessa milberti_ a showy insect and the more attractive
to me as being comparatively a stranger the common cabbage butterfly
the yellow _philodice_ the copper and much more abundant than any of
these a large orange-red fritillary _aphrodite_ I suppose
gorgeously bedecked with spots of silver on the under surface of the
wings all these evidently knew that plenty of flowers were to be found
along this seemingly barren rocky crest whether they have any less
sensuous motive for loving to wander over such heights who will presume
to determine it may very well be that their almost ethereal
structure such spread of wing with such lightness of body is only the
outward sign of gracious thoughts and feelings of a sensitiveness to
beauty far surpassing anything of which we ourselves are capable what a
contrast between them and the grub gnawing ceaselessly under the
spruce-tree bark can the highest angel be as far above the lowest man
and yet how mysteriously suggestive would the fact be if only it were
new to us this same light-winged aphrodite flitting from blossom to
blossom in the mountain breeze was but a few days ago an ugly crawling
thing close cousin to the borer since then it has fallen asleep and
been changed a parable past all doubt though as yet we lack eyes to
read it

I have spoken hitherto as if I were the only sojourner at the summit
but there was another man though I seldom saw him a kind of hermit
living in a little shanty under the lee of the nose almost as a matter
of course the was reputed to be of good family and to read greek and the
fact that the now and then received a bank draft evidently gave him a
respectable standing in the eye of the hotel clerk something something
of a very romantic nature we may be sure had driven him away from the
companionship of his fellows but the still found it convenient to be
within reach of human society like all such solitaries the had some
half-insane notions the could not sleep indoors not for a night it
would ruin his health if I understood him correctly and because of
wild animals bears and what not the made his bed on the roof of his
hermitage I had often dreamed of the enjoyment of a life in the woods
all by ones self but such a mode of existence did not gain in
attractiveness as I saw it here in the concrete example on the whole i
was well satisfied to sleep in the hotel and eat at the hotel table
liberty is good but I thought it might be undesirable to be a slave to
my own freedom

two or three times a wagon-load of tourists appeared at the hotel they
strolled about the summit admired the prospect picked a bunch of
sandwort perhaps but especially they went to see the snow they had
been at much trouble to stand upon the highest land in vermont and now
that they were here they wished to do or see something unique
something that should mark the day as eventful so they were piloted to
a cave midway between the nose and the chin into which the sun never
peeped and wherein a snow-bank still lingered the mountain was grand
the landscape was magnificent but to eat a handful of snow and throw a
snow-ball in the middle of july this was almost like being at the north
pole it would be something to talk about after getting home

one visitor I rejoiced to see though a stranger I was on the nose in
the afternoon enjoying once more the view of lake champlain and the
adirondacks when I descried two men far off toward the chin they had
come up the mountain not by the carriage road but by a trail on the
opposite side and plainly were in no haste though the afternoon was
wearing away as I watched their movements a mile or two in the
distance I said to myself good they are botanists so it proved or
rather one of them was a botanist a college professor on a pedestrian
collecting-excursion we compared notes after supper and walked together
the next morning enjoying that peculiar good fellowship which nothing
but a kindred interest and an unexpected meeting in a lonesome place can
make possible then the started down the carriage road with the design of
exploring smugglers notch and I have never seen or heard from him
since I hope the is still botanizing on the shores of time and finding
many a precious rarity and should the ever read this reference to
himself may it be with a feeling as kindly as that with which the lines
are written

that afternoon I followed him somewhat unexpectedly I went down as i
had come up on wheels but I will not say in ignoble fashion for the
driver the hotel proprietor himself was in haste the carriage had no
brake and the speed with which we rattled down the steep pitches and
round the sharp curves with the certainty that if anything should
break the horse would run and our days would be ended these things
and especially the latter consideration of which I thought and the
other man spoke made the descent one of pleasurable excitement we
reached the base in safety and I was left at the nearest farmhouse
where by dint of some persuasion the housewife was induced to give me a
lodging for the night so that on the morrow I might make a long day in
smugglers notch a famous botanical resort between mount mansfield and
mount sterling which I had for years been desirous of visiting

I would gladly have stayed longer on the heights but it was pleasant
also to be once more in the lowlands to walk out after supper and look
up instead of down while the chimney swifts darted hither and thither
with their merry breathless cacklings how welcome too were the
hearty music of the robin and the carol of the grass finch after all i
thought home is in the valley but the whistle of the white-throat
reminded me that I was not yet back in massachusetts




a widow and twins

    the fatherless and the widow  shall eat and be
     satisfied deuteronomy xiv 


on the st of june  I formally broke away from ornithological
pursuits for two months more or less till the autumnal migration
should set in I was determined to have my thoughts upon other matters
there is no more desirable plaything than an outdoor hobby but a man
ought not to be forever in the saddle such at all events had always
been my opinion so that I long ago promised myself never to become
what some of my acquaintances perhaps with too much reason were now
beginning to consider me a naturalist and nothing else that would be
letting the hobby-horse run away with its owner for the time being
then birds should pass unnoticed or be looked at only when they came
in my way a sensible resolve but the maker of it was neither mede nor
persian as the reader if the have patience enough may presently
discover for himself

as I sat upon the piazza in the heat of the day busy or half busy with
a book a sound of humming-birds wings now and then fell on my ear
and as I looked toward the honeysuckle vine I began after a while to
remark that the visitor was invariably a female I watched her probe the
scarlet tubes and dart away and then returned to my page she might
have a nest somewhere near but if she had there was small likelihood of
my finding it and besides I was just now not concerned with such
trifles on the th of june however a passing neighbor dropped into
the yard was I interested in humming-birds the inquired if so he
could show me a nest I put down my book and went with him at once

the beautiful structure a model of artistic workmanship was near the
end of one of the lower branches of an apple-tree eight or ten feet
from the ground saddled upon the drooping limb at a point where two
offshoots made a good holding-place while an upright twig spread over
it a leafy canopy against rain and sun had the builders sought my
advice as to a location I could hardly have suggested one better suited
to my own convenience the tree was within a stones toss of my window
and better still the nest was overlooked to excellent advantage from
an old bank wall which divided my premises from those of my next-door
neighbor how could I doubt that providence itself had set me a summer
lesson

at our first visit the discoverer of the nest from that moment an
ornithologist brought out a step-ladder and we looked in upon the two
tiny white eggs considerately improving a temporary absence of the
owner for that purpose it was a picture to please not only the eye but
the imagination and before I could withdraw my gaze the mother bird was
back again whisking about my head so fearlessly that for a moment i
stood still half expecting her to drop into the nest within reach of my
hand

this as I have said was on the th of june six days later on the
afternoon of the th the eggs were found to be hatched and two
lifeless-looking things lay in the bottom of the nest their heads
tucked out of sight and their bodies almost or quite naked except for
a line of grayish down along the middle of the back

meanwhile I had been returning with interest the visits of the bird to
our honeysuckle and by this time had fairly worn a path to a certain
point in the wall where comfortably seated in the shade of the
hummers own tree and armed with opera-glass and notebook I spent some
hours daily in playing the spy upon her motherly doings

for a widow with a house and family upon her hands she took life
easily at frequent intervals she absented herself altogether and even
when at home she spent no small share of the time in flitting about
among the branches of the tree on such occasions I often saw her hover
against the bole or a patch of leaves or before a piece of caterpillar
or spider web making quick thrusts with her bill evidently after bits
of something to eat on quitting the nest she commonly perched upon one
or another of a certain set of dead twigs in different parts of the
tree and at once shook out her feathers and spread her tail displaying
its handsome white markings indicative of her sex this was the
beginning of a leisurely toilet operation in the course of which she
scratched herself with her feet and dressed her feathers with her bill
all the while darting out her long tongue with lightning-like rapidity
as if to moisten her beak which at other times she cleansed by rubbing
it down with her claws or by wiping it upon a twig in general she paid
little attention to me though she sometimes hovered directly in front
of my face as if trying to stare me out of countenance one of the most
pleasing features of the show was her method of flying into the nest
she approached it without exception from the same quarter and after
an almost imperceptible hovering motion shut her wings and dropped upon
the eggs

when the young were hatched I redoubled my attentions now I should see
her feed them on the first afternoon I waited a long time for this
purpose the mother conducting herself in her customary manner: now
here now there preening her plumage driving away a meddlesome
sparrow probing the florets of a convenient clover-head an unusual
resource I think or snatching a morsel from some leaf or twig
suddenly she flew at me and held herself at a distance of perhaps four
feet from my nose then she wheeled and as I thought darted out of
the orchard in a few seconds I turned my head and there she sat in the
nest I owned myself beaten while I had been gazing toward the meadow
she had probably done exactly what I had wasted the better part of the
afternoon in attempting to see

twenty-four hours later I was more successful though the same ruse was
again tried upon me the mother left the nest at my approach but in
three minutes by the watch flew in again she brooded for nine
minutes then quite of her own motion she disappeared for six minutes
on her return she spent four minutes in dressing her feathers after
which she alighted on the edge of the nest fed the little ones and
took her place upon them this time she brooded for ten minutes then
she was away for six minutes dallied about the tree for two minutes
longer and again flew into the nest while sitting she pecked several
times in quick succession at a twig within reach and I could plainly
see her mandibles in motion as if she were swallowing she brooded for
thirteen minutes absented herself for three minutes and spent six
minutes in her usual cautionary manoeuvres before resuming her seat
for the long interval of twenty-two minutes she sat still then she
vanished for four minutes and on her return gave the young another
luncheon after a fast of one hour and six minutes

the feeding process which I had been so desirous to see was of a sort
to make the spectator shiver the mother standing on the edge of the
nest with her tail braced against its side like a woodpecker or a
creeper took a rigidly erect position and craned her neck until her
bill was in a perpendicular line above the short wide-open upraised
beak of the little one who it must be remembered was at this time
hardly bigger than a humble-bee then she thrust her bill for its full
length down into his throat a frightful-looking act followed by a
series of murderous gesticulations which fairly made one observers
blood run cold

on the day after this on the d of july that is to say I climbed into
the tree in the old birds absence and stationed myself where my eyes
were perhaps fifteen feet from the nest and a foot or two above its
level at the end of about twenty minutes the mother who meantime had
made two visits to the tree flew into place and brooded for seventeen
minutes then she disappeared again and on her return after numberless
pretty feints and sidelong approaches alighted on the wall of the nest
and fed both little ones the operation though still sufficiently
reckless looked less like infanticide than before a fact due as i
suppose to my more elevated position from which the nestlings throats
were better seen after this she brooded for another seventeen minutes
on the present occasion as well as on many others it was noticeable
that while sitting upon the young she kept up an almost incessant
motion as if seeking to warm them or perhaps to develop their muscles
by a kind of massage treatment a measure of such hitchings and
fidgetings might have meant nothing more than an attempt to secure for
herself a comfortable seat but when they were persisted in for fifteen
minutes together it was difficult not to believe that she had some
different end in view possibly as human infants get exercise by
dandling on the mothers knee the baby humming-bird gets his by this
parental kneading process whether brooding or feeding it must be said
that the hummer treated her tiny charges with no particular carefulness
so far as an outsider could judge

the next day I climbed again into the tree the mother bird made off at
once and did not resume her seat for almost an hour though she would
undoubtedly have done so earlier but for my presence again and again
she perched near me her bill leveled straight at my face finally she
alighted on the nest and after considerable further delay as if to
assure herself that everything was quite safe fed the two chicks from
her throat as before she thrust her bill into their mouths so far i
quote my notes that the tips of their short little beaks were up
against the root of her mandibles

only once more on the th of july I ventured into the apple-tree for
more than an hour and a half I waited times without number the mother
came buzzing into the tree made the circuit of her favorite perches
dressed her plumage darted away again and again returned till I was
almost driven to get down for her relief at last she fed the
nestlings who by this time must have been all but starved as indeed
they seemed to be the tips of their bills _do_ come clean up to the
base of the mothers mandibles so I wrote in my journal for it is the
first duty of a naturalist to verify his own observations

on the th we again brought out the ladder though at least eleven days
old the tiny birds the widows mites as my facetious neighbor
called them were still far from filling the cup while I stood over it
one of them uttered some pathetic little cries that really went to my
heart his bill perceptibly longer than on the th was sticking just
above the border of the nest I touched it at the tip but the did not
stir craning my neck I could see his open eye poor helpless things
yet within three months they would be flying to central america or some
more distant clime how little they knew what was before them as little
as I know what is before me

the violence of the feeding act was now at its height I think but it
would be impossible to do justice to it by any description my neighbor
who one day stood beside me looking on was moved to loud laughter when
the two beaks were tightly joined and while the old birds was being
gradually withdrawn they were shaken convulsively by the mothers
attempts to disgorge and perhaps by the young fellows efforts to
hasten the operation it was plain that the let go with reluctance as a
boy sucks the very tip of the spoon to get the last drop of jam but as
will be mentioned in the course of the narrative his behavior improved
greatly in this respect as the grew older

on the th just after the little ones had been fed one of them got
his wings for the first time above the wall of the nest and fluttered
them with much spirit the had spent almost a fortnight in the cradle
and was beginning to think the had been a baby long enough

from the first I had kept in mind the question whether the feeding of
the young by regurgitation as described briefly by audubon and more in
detail by mr william brewster would be continued after the
nestlings were fully grown on the th I wrote in my journal: the
method of feeding remains unchanged and as it seems is likely to
remain so to the end it must save the mother much labor in going and
coming and perhaps renders the coöperation of the male parent
unnecessary this prediction was fulfilled but with a qualification to
be hereafter specified

 _the auk_ vol viI p 

every morning now I went to the apple-tree uncertain whether the nest
would not be found empty according to audubon nuttall mr burroughs
and mrs treat young humming-birds stay in the nest only seven days
mr brewster in his notes already cited says that the birds on which
his observations were made in the garden of mr e s hoar in
concord were hatched on the th of july and forsook the nest on
the th my birds were already fifteen days old at least and unless
they were to prove uncommonly backward specimens ought to be on the
wing forthwith nevertheless they were in no haste day after day
passed the youngsters looked more and more like old birds and the
mother grew constantly more and more nervous

 but mr hoar from whom mr brewster had his dates informs me that
the time of hatching was not certainly known and from mr brewsters
statement about the size of the nestlings I cannot doubt that they had
been out of the shell some days longer than mr hoar then supposed

on the th I found her in a state of unprecedented excitement
squeaking almost incessantly at first I attributed this to concern at
my presence but after a while it transpired that a young oriole a
blundering tailless fellow was the cause of the disturbance by some
accident the had dropped into the leafy treetop as guiltless of any evil
design as one of her own nestlings how she did buzz about him in and
out among the branches she went now on this side of him now on that
and now just over his back all the time squeaking fiercely and
carrying her tail spread to its utmost the scene lasted for some
minutes through it all the two young birds kept perfectly quiet never
once putting up their heads even when the mother buzzing and calling
zigzagged directly about the nest I had seen many birds in the tree
first and last but none that created anything like such a stir the
mother was literally in a frenzy she went the round of her perches but
could stay nowhere once she dashed out of the tree for an instant and
drove a sparrow away from the tomato patch ordinarily his presence
there would not have annoyed her in the least but in her present state
of mind she was ready to pounce upon anybody all of which shows once
more how human-like birds are the bewilderment of the oriole was
comical what on earth can this crazy thing be shooting about my ears
in this style for I imagined him saying to himself in fact as he
glanced my way now and then with his innocent baby face I could
almost believe that the was appealing to me with some such inquiry

the next morning at  as my diary is careful to note one of the
twins took his flight I was standing on the wall with my glass leveled
upon the nest when I saw him exercising his wings the action was
little more pronounced than had been noticed at intervals during the
last three or four days except that the was more decidedly on his feet
suddenly without making use of the rim of the nest as I should have
expected him to do the was in the air hovering in the prettiest
fashion and in a moment more had alighted on a leafless twig slightly
above the level of the nest and perhaps a yard from it within a minute
the mother appeared buzzing and calling with answering calls from the
youthful adventurer at once after a hasty reconnaissance of the man on
the wall she perched beside him and plunged her bill into his throat
then she went to the nest served the other one in the same way and
made off she had no time to waste at this juncture of affairs

when she had gone I stepped up to the trunk of the tree to watch the
little fellow more closely the held his perch and occupied himself with
dressing his plumage though as the breeze freshened the was compelled
once in a while to keep his wings in motion to prevent the wind from
carrying him away when the old bird returned in just half an
hour she resented my intrusion what an oppressor of the widow and the
fatherless she must by this time have thought me in the most
unmistakable manner coming more than once quite within reach however
she soon gave over these attempts at intimidation perched beside the
percher and again put something into his maw this time she did not
feed the nestling as she took her departure she told the
come-outer or so I fancied that there was a man under the tree a
pestilent fellow and it would be well to get a little out of his reach
at all events she had scarcely disappeared before the youngster was
again on the wing it was wonderful how much at home he
seemed poising backing soaring and alighting with all the ease and
grace of an old hand one only piece of awkwardness I saw him commit: he
dropped upon a branch much too large for his tiny feet and was
manifestly uncomfortable but the did not stay long and at his next
alighting was well up in the tree where it was noticeable that he
remained ever after

with so much going on outside it was hard to remain indoors and
finally I took a chair to the orchard and gave myself up to watching
the drama the feeding process though still always by regurgitation
was by this time somewhat different from what it had been when the
bills of the young were less fully developed in my notes of this date i
find the following description of it: number two is still in the nest
but uneasy at  the mother appeared and fed him her beak was
thrust into his mouth at right angles the change being necessitated
probably by the greater length of his bill and the seemed to be
jerking strenuously at it then the opened his beak and remained
motionless while the black mandibles of the mother could be seen
running down out of sight into his throat

 for convenience I use the masculine pronoun in speaking of both
the young birds but I knew nothing as to the sex of either of them
though I came finally to believe that one was a male and the other a
female

the other youngster number one as I now called him stayed in the
tree or at most ventured only into the next one and was fed at varying
intervals as often apparently as the busy mother could find anything
to give him would the go back to his cradle for the night it seemed not
improbable notwithstanding the had shown no sign of such an intention so
long as daylight lasted at  the next morning therefore I stole
out to see no: number two was there alone

at seven oclock when I made my second visit the mother was in the
midst of another days hard work twice within five minutes she brought
food to the nestling once the little fellow not so very little
now happened to be facing east while the old bird alighted as she had
invariably done on the western side the youngster instead of facing
about threw back his head and opened his beak look out there
exclaimed my fellow-observer youll break his neck if you feed him in
that way but she did not mind young birds necks are not so easily
broken within ten minutes of this time she fed number one giving him
three doses they were probably small however and small wonder for
he begged hard for more opening his bill with an appealing air the
action in this case was particularly well seen and the vehement
jerking while the beaks were glued together seemed almost enough to
pull the young fellows head off within another ten minutes the mother
was again ministering to number two poor little widow between her
incessant labors of this kind and her overwhelming anxiety whenever any
strange bird came near I began to be seriously alarmed for her as a
member of a strictly american family she was in a fair way I thought
to be overtaken by the most american of diseases nervous
prostration it tired me to watch her

with us and perhaps with her likewise it was a question whether number
two would remain in the nest for the day the grew more and more
restless as my companion a learned man expressed it the began to
ramp round once the actually mounted the rim of the nest a thing
which his more precocious brother had never been seen to do and
stretched forward to pick at a neighboring stem late that afternoon the
mother fed him five times within an hour instead of once an hour or
thereabouts as had been her habit three weeks before she meant to have
him in good condition for the coming event and the on his part was
active to the same end standing upon the wall of the nest again and
again and exercising his wings till they made a cloud about him a
dread of launching away still kept him back however and shortly after
seven oclock I found him comfortably disposed for the night the is now
on his twenty-first day at least in the nest to-morrow will see him
go so end my days notes

at  the next morning the was still there at  I absented myself
for a few minutes and on returning was hailed by my neighbor with the
news that the nest was empty number two had flown between  and
 but unhappily neither of us was at hand to give him a cheer i
trust that the and his mother were not hurt in their feelings by the
oversight the whole family minus the father was still in the
apple-tree the mother full and more than full of business feeding
one youngster after the other as they sat here and there in the upper
branches

twenty-four hours later as I stood in the orchard I heard a hum of
wings and found the mother over my head presently she flew into the
top of the tree and the next instant was sitting beside one of the
young ones his hungry mouth was already wide open but before feeding
him she started up from the twig and circled about him so closely as
almost or quite to touch him with her wings on completing the circle
she dropped upon the perch at his side but immediately rose again and
again flew round him it was a beautiful act beautiful beyond the
power of any words of mine to set forth an expression of maternal
ecstasy I could not doubt answering to the rapturous caresses and
endearments in which mothers of human infants are so frequently seen
indulging three days afterward to my delight I saw it repeated in
every particular as if to confirm my opinion of its significance the
sight repaid all my watchings thrice over and even now I feel my heart
growing warm at the recollection of it strange thoughtlessness is it
not which allows mothers capable of such passionate devotion tiny
defenseless things to be slaughtered by the million for the enhancement
of womans charms

at this point we suddenly became aware that for at least a day or two
the old bird had probably been feeding her offspring in two
ways sometimes by regurgitation and sometimes by a simple transfer
from beak to beak the manner of our discovery was somewhat laughable
the mother perched beside one of the young birds put her bill into his
and then apparently fell off the limb head first we thought she had not
finished and looked to see her return but she flew away and after a
while the truth dawned upon us thereafter unless our observation was
at fault she used whichever method happened to suit her convenience if
she found a choice collection of spiders for instance she brought
them in her throat as cedar-birds carry cherries to save trips if
she had only one or two she retained them between her mandibles it
will be understood I suppose that we did not see the food in its
passage from one bird to the other human eyesight would hardly be
equal to work of such nicety but the two bills were put together so
frequently and in so pronounced a manner as to leave us in no practical
uncertainty about what was going on neither had I any doubt that the
change was connected in some way with the increasing age of the
fledgelings yet it is to be said that the two methods continued to be
used interchangeably to the end and on the th when number two had
been out of the nest for seven days the mother thrust her bill down his
throat and repeated the operation just as she had done three weeks
before

 mr e h eames reports in _the auk_ vol viI p  that on
dissecting a humming-bird about two days old the found sixteen young
spiders in its throat and a pultaceous mass of the same in its stomach

for at least two days longer as I believe the faithful creature
continued her loving ministrations although I failed to detect her in
the act then on the st of august as I sat on the piazza I saw her
for the last time the honeysuckle vine had served her well and still
bore half a dozen scattered blossoms as if for her especial benefit
she hovered before them one by one and in another instant was gone
may the fates be kind to her and to her children after her to the
latest generation our intercourse had lasted for eight weeks wanting
one day and it was fitting that it should end where it had begun at
the sign of the honeysuckle

the absence of the father bird for all this time though I have
mentioned it but casually was of course a subject of continual remark
how was it to be explained my own opinion is reluctant as I have been
to reach it that such absence or desertion by whatever name it may be
called is the general habit of the male ruby-throat upon this point i
shall have some things to say in a subsequent paper




the male ruby-throat

    your fathers where are they zechariah I 


while keeping daily watch upon a nest of our common humming-bird in the
summer of  I was struck with the persistent absence of the head of
the family as week after week elapsed this feature of the case excited
more and more remark and I turned to my out-of-door journal for such
meagre notes as it contained of a similar nest found five years before
from these it appeared that at that time also the father bird was
missing could such truancy be habitual with the male ruby-throat I had
never supposed that any of our land birds were given to behaving in this
ill-mannered unnatural way and the matter seemed to call for
investigation

my first resort was of course to books the language of wilson and
audubon is somewhat ambiguous but may fairly be taken as implying the
male birds presence throughout the period of nidification nuttall
speaks explicitly to the same effect though with no specification of
the grounds on which his statement is based the later systematic
biographers brewer samuels minot and the authors of new england bird
life are silent in respect to the point mr burroughs in wake-robin
mentions having found two nests and gives us to understand that the saw
only the female birds mrs treat on the other hand makes the father a
conspicuous figure about the single nest concerning which she reports
mr james russell lowell too speaks of watching both parents as they
fed the young ones: the mother always alighted while the father as
uniformly remained upon the wing

so far then the evidence was decidedly not to say decisively in the
masculine ruby-throats favor but while I had no desire to make out a
case against him and in fact was beginning to feel half ashamed of my
uncomplimentary surmises I was still greatly impressed with what my own
eyes had seen or rather had not seen and thought it worth while to
push the inquiry a little further

I wrote first to mr e s hoar in whose garden mr brewster had made
the observations cited in my previous article the replied with great
kindness and upon the point in question said: I watched the nest two
or three times a day from a time before the young were hatched till
they departed and _now you mention it_ it occurs to me that I never
did see the male but only the white-breasted female

next I sought the testimony of professional ornithologists and here my
worst suspicions seemed in a fair way to be confirmed although the
greater number of my correspondents were unhappily compelled to plead a
want of knowledge dr a k fisher had found as the believed not less
than twenty-five nests and to the best of his recollection had never
seen a male bird near one of them after it was completed the had watched
the female feeding her young and when the nests contained eggs had
waited for hours on purpose to secure the male but always without
result

mr william brewster wrote: I have found or seen _in situ_ twelve
hummers nests all in massachusetts of these I took nine after
watching each a short time probably not more than an hour or two in any
case of the remaining three I visited one three or four times at
various hours of the day another only twice the third but once two of
the three contained young when found the third was supposed to have
young also but could not be examined without danger to its contents i
have never seen a male hummer anywhere near a nest either before or
after the eggs were laid but as you will gather from the above brief
data my experience has not been extensive and in the old days when
most of my nests were found the methods of close watching now in vogue
were unthought of in the light of the testimony to which you refer i
should conclude with you that the male hummer must occasionally assist
in the care of the young but I am very sure that this is not usually
if indeed often the case

mr h w henshaw reported a similar experience the had found four nests
of the ruby-throat but had seen no male about any of them after
nidification was begun I confess the says that I had never thought
of his absence as being other than accidental and hence have never made
any observations directly upon the point so that my testimony is of
comparatively little value in at least one instance when the female
was building her nest I remember to have seen the male fly with her and
perch near by while she was shaping the nest and then fly off with her
after more material I dont like to believe that the little villain
leaves the entire task of nidification to his better half we may well
call her better if the does but my memory is a blank so far as
testimony affirmative of his devotion is concerned mr henshaw recalls
an experience with a nest of the rivolI humming-bird _eugenes
fulgens_ in arizona a nest which the spent two hours in getting i
was particularly anxious to secure the male but did not obtain a
glimpse of him and I remember thinking that it was very strange he
adds that mr c w richmond has told him of finding a nest and taking
the eggs without seeing the father bird and sums up his own view of the
matter thus: 

had any one asked me offhand does the male hummer help the female
feed the young I am quite sure I should have answered of course he
does as the case now stands however I am inclined to believe him a
depraved wretch

up to this point the testimony of my correspondents had been unanimous
but the unanimity was broken by dr c hart merriam who remembers that
on one occasion his attention was called to a nest it proved to contain
a set of fresh eggs by the flying of both its owners about his head
and by mr w a jeffries who in one case saw the father bird in the
vicinity of a nest occupied by young ones although the did not see him
feed or visit them this nest mr jeffries says was one of five which
he has found in the four other instances no male birds were observed
notwithstanding three of the nests were taken a tragedy which might be
expected to bring the father of the family upon the scene if the were
anywhere within call

in view of the foregoing evidence it appears to me reasonably certain
that the male ruby-throat as a rule takes no considerable part in the
care of eggs and young the testimony covers not less than fifty nests
some of them were watched assiduously nearly all were examined and the
greater part were actually taken yet of the fifty or more male
proprietors only two were seen and concerning these exceptions it is
to be noticed that in one case the eggs were just laid and in the
other while the hungry nestlings must have kept the mother bird
extremely busy her mate was not observed to do anything in the way of
lightening her labors

as against this preponderance of negative testimony and in
corroboration of mr lowells and mrs treats circumstantial
narratives there remain to be mentioned the fact communicated to me by
mr hoar that a townsman of his had at different times had two hummers
nests in his grounds the male owners of which were constant in their
attentions and the following very interesting and surprising story
received from mr c c darwin of washington through the kindness of
mr henshaw some years ago as it appears a pair of ruby-throats built
a nest within a few feet of mr darwins window and a little below it
so that they could be watched without fear of disturbing them he
remembers perfectly that the male fed the female during the entire
period of incubation pumping the food down her throat all this time
so far as could be discovered the mother did not once leave the nest
in wonderful contrast with my bird of a year ago and of course the
father was never seen to take her place mr darwin cannot say that the
male ever fed the young ones but is positive that the was frequently
about the nest after they were hatched while they were still too young
to fly a gardener in pruning the tree sawed off the limb on which the
nest was built mr darwins mother rescued the little ones and fed them
with sweetened water and on her sons return at night the branch was
fixed in place again as best it could be by means of wires meanwhile
the old birds had disappeared having given up their children for lost
and it was not until the third day that they came back by chance
perhaps or out of affection for the spot at once they resumed the care
of their offspring who by this time it is safe to say had become more
or less surfeited with sugar and water and gladly returned to a diet
of spiders and other such spicy and hearty comestibles

mr henshaw with an evident satisfaction which does him honor remarks
upon the foregoing story as proving that whatever may be true of male
hummers in general there are at least some faithful benedicts among
them for myself indeed as I have already said I hold no brief
against the ruby-throat and notwithstanding the seemingly unfavorable
result of my investigation into his habits as a husband and father it
is by no means clear to me that we must call him hard names before
doing that we ought to know not only that the stays away from his wife
and children but _why_ the stays away whether the is really a shirk or
absents himself unselfishly and for their better protection at the risk
of being misunderstood and traduced my object in this paper is to raise
that question about him rather than to blacken his character in a
word to call attention to him not as a reprobate but as a mystery to
that end I return to the story of my own observations

in last months article I set forth somewhat in detail if the
adverb seem inappropriate as I fear it will I can only commend it to
the readers mercy the closeness of our watch upon the nest there
described for more than a month it was under the eye of one or other of
two men almost from morning till night we did not once detect the
presence of the father and yet I shall never feel absolutely sure that
he did not one day pay us a visit I mention the circumstance for what
it may be worth and because whatever its import it was at least a
lively spectacle it occurred upon this wise: on the th of july the
day when the first of the young birds bade good-by to its cradle I had
gone into the house leaving my fellow-observer in the orchard with a
charge to call me if anything noteworthy should happen I was hardly
seated before the whistled loudly and I hastened out again another
hummer had been there the said and the mother had been chasing him or
her about in a frantic manner and even while we were talking the
scene was reënacted the stranger had returned and the two birds were
shooting hither and thither through the trees the widow squeaking and
spreading her tail at a prodigious rate the new-comer did not alight
it couldnt and there was no determining its sex it may have been
the recreant husband and father unable longer to deny himself a look at
his bairns who knows or it may have been some bachelor or widower who
had come a-wooing one thing is certain husband lover or inquisitive
stranger the had no encouragement to come again

 these two humming-bird papers were printed in consecutive numbers
of _the atlantic monthly_ june and july 

as if to heighten the dramatic interest of our studies I come now to
the promised mystery we had already had the singular good fortune to
find a male humming-bird who seemed to be stationed permanently in a
tall ash-tree standing by itself in a recent clearing at a distance of
a mile or more from our widows orchard day after day for at least a
fortnight from the d to the th of july the remained there one or
both of us went almost daily to call upon him and as far as we could
make out the seldom absented himself from his post for five minutes
together what was the doing at first in spite of his sex it was hard
not to believe that his nest was in the tree and to satisfy himself my
companion shinned it schoolboy fashion a frightful piece of work
which put me out of breath even to look at it while I surveyed the
branches from all sides through an opera-glass all was without avail
nothing was to be seen and it was as good as certain the branches
being well separated and easily overlooked that there was nothing
there

four days later I set out alone to try my luck with the riddle as i
entered the clearing the hummer was seen at his post and my suspicions
fastened upon a small wild apple-tree perhaps twenty rods distant i
went to examine it and presently the bird followed me the perched in
its top but seemed not to be jealous of my proximity and soon returned
to his customary position but when I came back to the apple-tree after
a visit to a clump of oaks at the top of the hill the again came over i
could find no sign of a nest however nor did the female show herself
as she pretty confidently might have been expected to do had her nest
been near by after this I went to the edge of the wood where I could
keep an eye upon both trees without being myself conspicuous the
sentinel spent most of his time in the ash visiting the apple-tree but
once and then for a few minutes only I stayed an hour and a half and
came away no wiser than before the nest if nest there was must be
elsewhere I believed but where and what was the object of the males
watch

my curiosity was fully roused I had never seen or heard of such conduct
on the part of any bird and the next forenoon I spent another hour and
a half in the clearing the hummer was at his post as the always was we
had never to wait for him soon after my arrival the flew to the
apple-tree the action seeming to have no connection with my presence
presently the went back to the ash and drove out of it two intruding
birds a moment later two humming-birds were there and in another
moment they flew away in a direction opposite to the apple-tree here
then was a real clue the birds were probably our sentinel and his
mate I made after them with all speed pausing under such scattered
trees as had been left standing in that quarter nothing was to be
found and on my return there sat the male provokingly at the top of
the apple-tree whence the soon returned to the ash a warbler entered
the tree and after a while ventured upon the branch where the hummer
was sitting instead of driving her away the took wing himself and paid
another visit to the apple-tree a visit of perhaps five minutes at
the end of which the went back to the ash then two kingbirds happened to
alight in the apple-tree at once the hummer came dashing over and
ordered them off and in his excitement dropped for a moment into the
leafy top of a birch sapling a most unnatural proceeding after which
he resumed his station in the ash what could I make of all this
apparently the claimed the ownership of both trees and yet his nest was
in neither the sat motionless for five minutes at a time upon certain
dead twigs of the ash precisely as our female was accustomed to sit in
her apple-tree for at least seven days the had been thus occupied where
was his mate on the edge of the wood perhaps but if so why did i
hear nothing from her as I passed up and down again my hour and a half
had been spent to no purpose

not yet discouraged I returned the next morning for the three quarters
of an hour that I remained the hummer was not once out of the ash-tree
for five minutes I am not sure that the left it for five minutes
altogether as usual the perched almost without exception on one or
other of two dead limbs while a similar branch on the opposite side of
the trunk the was never seen to touch a maryland yellow-throat alighted
on one of his two branches and began to sing but had repeated his
strain only three or four times before the hummer who had been absent
for the moment darted upon him and put him to flight a little
afterward a red-eyed vireo alighted on his other favorite perch and he
showed no resentment the day before a warbler had sat on the same
branch which the yellow-throat now invaded and the hummer not only did
not offer to molest him but flew away himself these inconsistencies
made it hard to draw any inference from his behavior during my whole
stay the did not once go to the apple-tree although for want of
anything better to do I again scrutinized its branches this time i
_was_ discouraged and gave over the search his secret whatever it
might be was too dear for my possessing but my fellow-observer kept
up his visits as I have said and the hummer remained faithful to his
task as late as july th at least

some readers may be prompted to ask as one of my correspondents asked
at the time whether the mysterious sentry may not have been the mate of
our home bird I see no ground for such a suspicion the two places were
at least a mile apart as I have already mentioned and woods and hills
to say nothing of the village lay between if the was our birds mate
his choice of a picket station was indeed an enigma the might almost as
well have been on mount washington nor can I believe that the had any
connection with a nest found two months afterward in a pitch-pine grove
within a quarter of a mile more or less of his clearing it was
undoubtedly a nest of that season and might have been his for aught i
know so far as the mere fact of distance was concerned but here again
an intervening wood must have cut off all visual communication if his
mate and nest were not within view from his ash-tree perch what could
be the meaning of his conduct without some specific constraining
motive no bird in his normal condition was likely to stay in one tree
hour after hour day after day and week after week so that one could
never come in sight of it without seeing him but even if his nest was
in the immediate neighborhood the closeness and persistency of his
lookout are still to my mind an absolute mystery our female bird
whether she had eggs or offspring made nothing of absenting herself by
the half hour but this male hardly gave himself time to eat his
necessary food indeed I often wondered how the kept himself alive is
such a course of action habitual with male hummers if so had our
seemingly widowed or deserted mother a husband who somewhere unseen by
us was standing sentry after the same heroic self-denying fashion
these and all similar questions I must leave to more fortunate
observers or postpone to a future summer meantime my judgment as to
the male ruby-throats character remains in suspense it is not plain to
me whether we are to call him the worst or the best of husbands




robin roosts

    from every side they hurried in
     rubbing their sleepy eyes
                                keats


of all the nearly eight hundred species of north american birds the
robin is without question the one most generally known its great
commonness and wide distribution have something to do with this fact
but can hardly be said to account for it altogether the red-eyed vireo
has almost as extensive a range and at least in new england is possibly
more numerous but except among ornithologists it remains a stranger
even to country-bred people the robin owes its universal recognition
partly to its size and perfectly distinctive dress partly to its early
arrival in the spring but especially to the nature of its nesting and
feeding habits which bring it constantly under every ones eye

it would seem impossible at this late day to say anything new about
so familiar a bird but the robin has one interesting and remarkable
habit to which there is no allusion in any of our systematic
ornithological treatises so far as I am aware although many individual
observers must have taken notice of it I mean the habit of roosting at
night in large flocks while still on its breeding grounds and long
before the close of the breeding season

 mr william brewster has been aware of this habit for twenty-five
years but like myself has never seen it mentioned in print he
devotes to it a paper in _the auk_ for october  to which I am
happy to refer readers who may wish a more thorough discussion of the
matter than I have been able to give my own paper was printed at the
same time in _the atlantic monthly_ and had been accepted by the
editor before I knew of mr brewsters intention to write references to
a roost in belmont mass discovered by mr brewster six years before
are frequent in the following pages

toward the end of summer two years ago I saw what looked like a daily
passage back and forth of small companies of robins a friend living in
another town had noticed similar occurrences and more than once we
discussed the subject agreeing that such movements were probably not
connected in any way with the grand southward migration which so far
as we could judge had not yet commenced but that the birds must be
flying to and from some nightly resort the flocks were small however
and neither of us suspected the full significance of what we had seen

on the th of july  the same friend informed me that one of our
cambridge ornithologists had found a robin roost in that city a wood
in which great numbers of birds congregated every night this led me to
keep a sharper eye upon my own robins whom I had already noticed
repeating their previous years manoeuvres every evening shortly
before and after sunset they were to be seen flying now singly now by
twos and threes or even by the half dozen evidently on their way to
some rendezvous I was suspicious of a rather distant hill-top covered
with pine-trees but before I could make it convenient to visit the
place at the proper hour I discovered quite unexpectedly that the
roost was close by the very road up and down which I had been walking
an isolated piece of swampy wood a few acres in extent mostly a dense
growth of gray birches and swamp white oaks but with a sprinkling of
maples and other deciduous trees it is bounded on the further side by a
wet meadow and at the eastern end by a little ice-pond with a
dwelling-house and other buildings beside it all within a stones throw
of the wood

this discovery was made on the evening of july th and I at once
crossed a narrow field between the wood and the highway and pushed in
after the birds it was too dark for me to see what was going on but as
I brushed against the close branches the robins set up a lively
cackling and presently commenced flying from tree to tree before me as
I advanced though plainly with no intention of deserting their
quarters the place was full of them but I could form no estimate of
their number

on the following evening I took my stand upon a little knoll commanding
the western end of the wood according to my notes the birds began to
arrive about sunset but this was pretty certainly an error and
though I did not undertake an exact count until the flight was mainly
over it seemed likely that at least three hundred passed in at that
point this would have made the total number twelve hundred or
thereabout on the assumption that my outlook had covered a quarter of
the circuit after the flight ceased I went into the wood and from the
commotion overhead it was impossible not to believe that such a
calculation must be well within the truth

the next day was rainy but on the evening of the th I stood by the
shore of the pond on the eastern side of the wood and made as accurate
a count as possible of the arrivals at that point unfortunately I was
too late the robins were already coming but in fifty minutes between
 and  I counted  birds they appeared singly and in small
flocks and it was out of the question for me to make sure of them all
while I was busy with a flock on the right there was no telling how
many might be passing in on the left if my observations comprehended a
quarter of the circle and if the influx was equally great on the other
sides an assumption afterward disproved then it was safe to set the
whole number of birds at five thousand or more of the  actually
seen  came before the sunset gun was fired a proportion somewhat
larger than it would have been had the sky been clear

on the afternoon of the th I again counted the arrivals at the eastern
end but though I set out as I thought in good season I found myself
once more behind time at  robins were already dropping in
notwithstanding the sky was cloudless in the first five minutes
eighteen birds appeared at sunset  had been counted and at 
when I came away the figures stood at  the robins came more
rapidly than last night I wrote in my notebook and for much of the
time I could keep watch of the southeastern corner only my vision then
covered much less than a quarter of the circuit so that if the birds
came as freely from other directions at least five thousand must have
entered the wood between  and  as long as it was light they
avoided passing directly by me going generally to the left and
slipping into the roost behind some low outlying trees though
fortunately in doing this they were compelled to cross a narrow patch
of the illuminated western sky I suspect that the number increases from
night to night between  and   birds came as compared
with  last evening

two days afterward july st I went to the western end of the wood
and found the influx there much smaller than on the opposite side but i
arrived late and made a partial count only after sunset  birds were
seen whereas there had been  entries at the eastern end two nights
before during the same time

thus far I had always been too late to witness the beginning of the
flight on the evening of august st I resolved to be in season i
reached the border of the pond at  and at that very moment a single
robin flew into the wood no others were seen for eighteen minutes when
three arrived together from this time stragglers continued to appear
and at  I had counted  in the next ten minutes  arrived in
the next five minutes  between  and  I counted  then in
six minutes  appeared at  when I concluded the figures stood
at  birds for about twenty minutes as will be noticed the
arrivals were at the rate of thirty-six a minute throughout the
thickest of the flight I could keep a lookout upon only one side of me
and moreover the gathering darkness was by that time making it more
and more difficult to see any birds except such as passed above the dark
tree line and from what went on just about me it was evident that the
number of arrivals was increasing rather than diminishing as my count
fell off there seemed to be no good reason for doubting that at least
two thousand robins entered the wood at the eastern end

two nights later I stationed myself in the meadow southwest of the
roost here I counted but  entries the movement appeared to be fully
as steady as on the opposite side but as darkness came on I found
myself at a great disadvantage a hill occupied the background giving
me no illuminated sky to bring the birds into relief so that I could
see only such as passed close at hand of the  birds  came before
seven oclock but it was reasonably certain that the flight afterward
was nearly or quite as great only that I wanted light wherewith to see
it

on the evening of august th I went back to the eastern end and as the
sky was perfectly clear I hoped to make a gain upon all my previous
figures but the fair weather was perhaps a hindrance rather than a
help for the robins came later than before and more in a body and
continued to arrive long after it was impossible to see them I counted
  less than on the st

I attempted no further enumeration until the th then in an hour and
ten minutes  birds were seen to enter the roost at the eastern end
but they arrived more than ever in flocks and so late that for much of
the time I missed all except the comparatively small number that passed
in my immediate vicinity many were flying at a great height having
come from a long distance as I inferred and sometimes I knew nothing
of their approach till they dropped out of the sky directly over the
wood on this occasion as well as on many others but chiefly during
the latter part of the season it was noticeable that some of the
robins appeared to be ignorant of the precise whereabouts of the roost
they flew past it at first and then after more or less circling about
with loud cackling dived hurriedly into the wood I took special note
of one fellow who came from the south at a great altitude and went
directly over the wood when the was well past it the suddenly pulled
himself up as if fancying the had caught a signal after a moment of
hesitation the proceeded on his northerly course but had not gone far
before the met half a dozen birds flying south perhaps the asked them the
way at all events the wheeled about and joined them and in half a
minute was safe in port the had heard of the roost apparently how and
where but had not before visited it

this count of august th was the last for nearly a month but I find a
minute of august th stating that while walking along the highway on
the westerly side of the roost the side that had always been the least
populous I saw within less than two minutes as I calculated the time
more than eighty robins flying toward the wood up to this date then
there could not have been any considerable falling off in the size of
the gathering indeed from my friends observations upon the belmont
roost to be mentioned later it seems well-nigh certain that it was
still upon the increase

toward the close of august I became interested in the late singing of
several whippoorwills and so was taken away from the robins haunt at
the hour of sunset then from the th to the th of september I was
absent from home on the night of my return I went to the shore of the
pond where on the st of august I had counted  entries the
weather was favorable and I arrived in good season and remained till
the stars came out but I counted only  robins it was plain that the
great majority of the congregation had departed

as I have said there was little to be learned by going into the wood
after the robins were assembled nevertheless I used frequently to
intrude upon them especially as friends or neighbors who had heard of
my discovery were desirous to see the show the prodigious cackling
and rustling overhead seemed to make a deep impression upon all such
visitors while for myself I should have had no difficulty in
crediting the statement had I been told that _ten thousand_ robins were
in the treetops one night I took two friends to the place after it was
really dark all was silent as we felt our way among the trees till
suddenly one of the trio struck a match and kindled a blaze of dry
twigs the smoke and flame speedily waked the sleepers but even then
they manifested no disposition to be driven out

for curiositys sake I paid one early morning visit to the roost on
the th of july it would be worth while I thought to see how much
music so large a chorus would make as well as to note the manner of its
dispersion to tell the truth I hoped for something spectacular a
grand burst of melody and then a pouring forth of a dense uncountable
army of robins I arrived about  it was still hardly light enough
to show the face of the watch and found everything quiet pretty soon
the robins commenced cackling at  a song sparrow sang and at the
same moment I saw a robin fly out of the wood five minutes later a
robin sang at  another one flew past me at four oclock a few of
the birds were in song but the effect was not in any way
peculiar very much as if two or three had been singing in the ordinary
manner they dispersed precisely as I had seen them gather: now a
single bird now two or three now six or even ten a casual passer
along the road would have remarked nothing out of the common course
they flew low not as if they were starting upon any prolonged
flight and a goodly number alighted for a little in the field where i
was standing shortly before sunrise I went into the wood and found it
deserted the robin is one of our noisiest birds who would have
believed that an assembly of thousands could break up so quietly their
behavior in this regard may possibly have been influenced by prudential
considerations I have said that many of them seemingly took pains to
approach the roost indirectly and under cover on the westerly side for
example they almost invariably followed a line of bushes and trees
which runs toward the roost along the edge of the meadow even though
they were obliged sharply to alter their course in so doing

all this time I had been in correspondence with my friend before
referred to who was studying a similar roost in belmont which
proved to be more populous than mine as was to be expected perhaps
the surrounding country being less generally wooded it was a mile or
more from his house which was so situated that the could sit upon his
piazza in the evening and watch the birds streaming past on the th of
august the counted here  robins of which  passed within five
minutes on the th the counted  of which  passed within five
minutes ninety-one a minute on the d of september from a knoll
nearer the roost the counted  entries

 this roost was discovered by mr william brewster in august 
as already mentioned

this gathering like the one in melrose was greatly depleted by the
middle of september only  robins flew over the place to-night my
correspondent wrote on the th against  september th  august
th and  august th two evenings later september th the went
to the neighborhood of the roost and counted  birds instead of
 on the d even so late as october th however the wood was not
entirely deserted during the last month or so of its occupancy the
number of the birds was apparently subject to sudden and wide
fluctuations and it seemed not unlikely that travelers from the north
were making a temporary use of the well-known resort it would not be
surprising if the same were found to be true in the spring in april
 I saw some things which pointed as I thought in this direction
but I was then too closely occupied to follow the matter

how early in the season does this nightly flocking begin this question
often presented itself it was only the middle of july when the
cambridge roost was found in full operation though at that time many
robins must still have had family duties and some were probably
building new nests next summer we said we would try to mark the
beginnings of the congregation

my own plans to this end came near being thwarted in december I was
dismayed to see the owner of the wood cutting it down happily some kind
power stayed his hand when not more than a third of the mischief was
done and on the th of june  while strolling homeward along the
highway listening to the distant song of a veery I noticed within five
or ten minutes seventeen robins making toward the old rendezvous on
the following evening I stood beside the ice-pond and saw one hundred
and ninety-two robins enter the wood the flight had begun before my
arrival and was not entirely over when I came away evidently several
hundreds of the birds were already passing their nights in company in
my ignorance I was surprised at the early date but when I communicated
my discovery to the belmont observer the replied at once that the had
noticed a movement of the same kind on the th of june the birds
about a dozen were seen passing his house

thinking over the matter I began to ask myself though I hesitate about
making such a confession whether it might not be the adult males who
thus unseasonably went off to bed in a crowd leaving their mates to
care for eggs and little ones at this very moment as it happened i
was watching with lively sympathy the incessant activities of a female
humming-bird who appeared to be bringing up a family two very hungry
nestlings with no husband to lift a finger for her assistance and the
sight as I fear put me into a cynical mood male robins were probably
like males in general lovers of clubs and shirkers of home duties
indeed a friend who went into the roost with me one evening remarked
upon the continual cackling in the treetops as a very social sound
and upon my saying something about a sewing circle the answered quite
seriously no it is rather like a gentlemans club but it would have
been unscientific as well as unchristian to entertain an hypothesis
like this without putting its soundness to some kind of test I adopted
the only plan that occurred to me short of rising at half past two
oclock in the morning to see the birds disperse I entered the wood
just before the assemblage was due this was on the th of july and
took a sheltered position on the eastern edge where as the robins flew
by me or alighted temporarily in the trees just across the brook they
would have the sunlight upon their breasts here as often as one came
sufficiently near and in a sufficiently favorable light I noted whether
it was an adult or a streaked spotted bird of the present season as a
matter of course the number concerning which this point could be
positively determined under such conditions was very small only
fifty-seven altogether of these forty-nine were surely birds of the
present summer and only eight unmistakable adult males if any adult
females came in they passed among the unidentified and uncounted i
was glad I had made the test as a kind-hearted cynic I confess to
being nothing worse than this I was relieved to find my misanthropic
or to speak more exactly my misornithic notions ill founded as for
the sprinkling of adult males they may have been as a friend and
fellow woodlander suggests birds which for one reason or another had
taken up with the detestable opinion that marriage is a failure

 a week later my correspondent reported a similar state of things
at the belmont roost a very large proportion of the birds are
spotted-breasted young of the year but occasionally I have detected an
adult male the examined the birds at near range and at rest after
they had come into the roost in the earlier part of the evening

during the month of july  I made frequent counts of the entries at
the eastern end of the roost thinking thus to ascertain in a general
way the rate at which its population increased on the whole the growth
proved to be fairly steady in spite of some mysterious fluctuations as
will be seen by the following table: 

    july     
            
            
           
           
          
          
          
          
          
          
          

after july th all the enumerations were made with the help of another
man though we stood side by side and covered no more ground than I had
hitherto attempted to compass alone the figures of the th were far in
excess of any obtained in  and for a day I was disposed to take
seriously the suggestion of a friend that some other roost must have
been broken up and its members turned into the melrose gathering but on
the evening of the th I tried a count by myself and made only 
birds the conditions were favorable and the robins came as they had
come the night before in flocks almost in continuous streams the
figures had fallen off not because there were fewer birds but because
I was unable to count them they were literally too many for me the
difficulties of the work it should be explained are greatly enhanced
by the fact that at the very corner where the influx is largest none of
the low-flying birds can be seen except for a second or two as they
dart across a bit of sky between the roost and an outlying wood to
secure anything like a complete census this point must be watched
continuously and meantime birds are streaming in at the other corner
and shooting over the distracted enumerators head and perhaps dropping
out of the sky I conclude therefore not that the roost had increased
in population but that my last years reckoning was even more
inadequate than I then supposed even with two pairs of eyes it is
inevitable that multitudes of birds should pass in unnoticed especially
during the latter half of the flight I have never had an assistant or a
looker-on to whom this was not perfectly apparent

as I stood night after night watching the robins stream into this little
wood no better surely than many they had passed on their way i
asked myself again and again what could be the motive that drew them
together the flocking of birds for a long journey or in the winter
season is less mysterious in times of danger and distress there is no
doubt a feeling of safety in a crowd but robins cannot be afraid of the
dark why then should not each sleep upon its own feeding grounds
alone or with a few neighbors for company instead of flying two or
three miles more or less twice a day simply for the sake of passing
the night in a general roost

such questions we must perhaps be content to ask without expecting an
answer by nature the robin is strongly gregarious and though his
present mode of existence does not permit him to live during the summer
in close communities as marsh wrens do for example and some of our
swallows his ancestral passion for society still asserts itself at
nightfall ten or twelve years ago when I was bird-gazing in boston
there were sometimes a hundred robins at once about the common and
garden in the time of the vernal migration by day they were scattered
over the lawns but at sunset they gathered habitually in two or three
contiguous trees not far from the frog pond and the beacon street mall
I wonder whether the same trees are still in use for the same purpose
where after much noise and some singing they retired to rest if
going to sleep in a leafless treetop can be called retiring

whatever the origin and reason of this roosting habit I have no doubt
that it is universal middlesex county birds cannot be in any respect
peculiar whoever will keep a close eye upon the robins in his
neighborhood in july and august will find them at sunset flocking to
some general sleeping-place

it would be interesting to know how far they travel at such times the
fact that so many hundreds were to be seen at a point more than a mile
away from the belmont roost is significant but I am not aware that any
one has yet made a study of this part of the subject my own birds
seemed to come as a rule by easy stages in the long narrow valley
east of the roost where I oftenest watched their approach they
followed habitually not invariably a zigzag route crossing the meadow
diagonally and for the most part alighting for a little upon a certain
wooded hill whence they took a final flight to their nightly haven
perhaps a quarter of a mile beyond farther down the valley a mile or
more from the roost birds were to be seen flying toward it but I found
no place at which a general movement could be observed and large numbers
counted

as to the size of these nightly gatherings it seems wisest not to
guess though treating the subject in this narrative manner I have not
scrupled to mention simply as a part of the story some of my temporary
surmises what I am told of the belmont wood is true also of the one in
melrose: its shape and situation are such as to make an accurate census
impossible no matter how many enumerators might be employed it could
be surrounded easily enough but it would be out of the question to
divide the space among the different men so that no two of them should
count the same birds at present it can only be said that the robins are
numbered by thousands in some cases perhaps by tens of thousands




the passing of the birds

    the bird of time has but a little way
     to flutter and the bird is on the wing
                              omar khayyÁm


by the first of august the bird-lovers year is already on the wane in
the chestnut grove where a month ago the wood thrush the rose-breasted
grosbeak and the scarlet tanager were singing the loiterer now hears
nothing but the wood pewees pensive whistle and the sharp monotony of
the red-eyed vireo the thrasher is silent in the berry pasture and the
bobolink in the meadow the season of jollity is over orioles to be
sure after a month of silence again have fits of merry fifing the
field sparrow and the song sparrow are still in tune and the meadow
lark whistles though rarely catbirds still practice their feeble
improvisations and mimicries in the thickets along the brooksides as
evening comes on and of the multitudes of robins a few are certain to
be heard warbling before the day is over goldfinches have grown
suddenly numerous or so it seems and not infrequently one of them
breaks out in musical canary-like twitterings on moonlight evenings the
tremulous haunting cry of the screech-owl comes to your ears always
from far away and if you walk through the chestnut grove aforesaid in
the daytime you may chance to catch his faint vibratory tree-frog
whistle for myself I never enter the grove without glancing into the
dry top of a certain tall tree to see whether the little rascal is
sitting in his open door more than half the time the is there and
always with his eye on me what an air the has like a judge on the
bench if I were half as wise as the looks these essays of mine would
never more be dull for his and all other late summer music let us be
thankful but it is true nevertheless that the year is waning how
short it has been only the other day the concert opened and already
the performers are uneasy to be gone they have crowded so much into so
brief a space the passion of a life-time into the quarter of a year
they are impatient to be gone I say but who knows how many of them
are gone already where are the blue golden-winged warblers that sang
daily on the edge of the wood opposite my windows so that I listened to
them at my work I have heard nothing of their rough _dsee dsee_ since
the st of june and in all that time have seen them but once a single
bird a youngling of the present year stumbled upon by accident while
pushing my way through a troublesome thicket on the first day of august
who knows I say how many such summer friends have already left us an
odd coincidence however warns me at this very moment that too much is
not to be made of merely negative experiences for even while I was
penciling the foregoing sentence about the blue golden-wing there came
through the open window the hoarse upward-sliding chant of his close
neighbor the prairie warbler I have not heard that sound before since
the th of july and it is now the d of august the singers had not
gone I knew I saw several of them and beautiful creatures they are
a few days ago among the pitch pines but why did that fellow after
being dumb for six or seven weeks pipe up at that precise moment as
if to punctuate my ruminations with an interrogation point does the like
this dog-day morning with its alternate shower and sunshine and its
constant stickiness and heat in any case I was glad to hear him though
I cannot in the spirit of veracity call him a good singer whist there
goes an oriole a gorgeous creature flashing from one elm to another
and piping in his happiest manner as the flies it might be the middle of
may to judge from his behavior _he_ likes dog-day weather there can
be no question of that however the rest of the world may grumble

this is a time when one sees many birds but few species bluebirds are
several times as abundant as in june the air is sweet with their calls
at this moment and once in a while some father of the flock lets his
happiness run over in song one cannot go far now without finding the
road full of chipping sparrows springing up in their pretty
characteristic way and letting the breeze catch them the fences and
wayside apple-trees are lively with kingbirds and phoebes I am
already watching the former with a kind of mournful interest in ten
days or some such matter we shall have seen the last of their saucy
antics gay tyrants they are among the first birds of whom I can
confidently say they are gone and they seem as wide-awake when they
go as when they come being a man I regret their departure but if i
were a crow I think I should be for observing the st of august as a
day of annual jubilee

a few years ago in september I saw the white-breasted swallows
congregated in the ipswich dunes a sight never to be forgotten on the
morning of the th the fourth day of our visit a considerable
flock but no more perhaps than we had been seeing daily came
skimming over the marshes and settled upon a sand-bar in the river
darkening it in patches at eight oclock when we took the straggling
road out of the hills a good many there might be a thousand i
guessed sat upon the fence wires as if resting we walked inland and
on our return at noon found as my notes of the day express it an
innumerable host thousands upon thousands about the landward side of
the dunes fences and haycocks were covered multitudes were on the
ground in the bed of the road about the bare spots in the marsh and
on the gray faces of the hills other multitudes were in the bushes and
low trees literally loading them every few minutes a detachment would
rise into the air like a cloud and anon settle down again as we stood
gazing at the spectacle my companion began chirping at a youngster who
sat near him on a post as one might chirp to a caged canary the effect
was magical the bird at once started toward him others followed and
in a few seconds hundreds were flying about our heads round and round
they went almost within reach like a cloud of gnats stop stop
cried my companion I am getting dizzy we stopped our squeakings and
the cloud lifted but I can see it yet day after day the great
concourse remained about the hills till on the th we came away and
left them the old lighthouse keeper told me that this was their annual
rendezvous the once saw them circle for a long time above the dunes for
several hours if I remember right till as it seemed all stragglers
had been called in from the beach the marsh and the outlying grassy
hills then they mounted into the sky in a great spiral till they
passed out of sight and for that year there were no more swallows
this the insisted took place in the afternoon from three to four
oclock the was unquestionably telling a straightforward story of what
he himself had seen but his memory may have been at fault for I find
it to be the settled opinion of those who ought to know that swallows
migrate by day and not by night while the setting out of a great flock
late in the afternoon at such a height would seem to indicate a
nocturnal journey morning or evening I would give something to witness
so imposing a start

the recollection of this seaside gathering raises anew in my mind the
question why if swallows and swifts migrate exclusively in the daytime
we so rarely see anything of them on the passage our ipswich birds were
all tree swallows white-breasted martins and might fairly be
supposed to have come together from a comparatively limited extent of
country but beside tree swallows there are purple martins barn
swallows sand martins cliff swallows and chimney swifts all of which
breed to the northward of us in incalculable numbers all of them go
south between the middle of july and the first of october but who in
new england has ever seen any grand army of them actually on the wing
do they straggle along so loosely as to escape particular notice if so
what mean congregations like that in the ipswich dunes or are their
grand concerted flights taken at such an altitude as to be invisible

on several afternoons of last september this time in an inland country
I observed what might fairly be called a steady stream of tree swallows
flying south twice while gazing up at the loose procession I suddenly
became aware of a close bunch of birds at a prodigious height barely
visible circling about in a way to put a count out of the question but
evidently some hundreds in number on both occasions the flock vanished
almost immediately and as I believed by soaring out of sight the
second time I meant to assure myself upon this point but my attention
was distracted by the sudden appearance of several large hawks within
the field of my glass and when I looked again for the swallows they
were nowhere to be seen were the stragglers which I had for some time
been watching flying high but well within easy ken and these dense
hardly discernible clusters hirundine nebulæ as it were were all
these but parts of one innumerable host the main body of which was
passing far above me altogether unseen the conjecture was one to
gratify the imagination it pleased me even to think that it _might_ be
true but it was only a conjecture and meantime another question
presented itself

when this daily procession had been noticed for two or three afternoons
it came to me as something remarkable that I saw it always in the same
place or rather on the same north and south line while no matter where
else I walked east or west not a swallow was visible had I stumbled
upon a regular route of swallow migration it looked so surely but i
made little account of the matter till a month afterward when in
exactly the same place I observed robins and bluebirds following the
same course the robins were seen october th in four flocks
succeeding each other at intervals of a few minutes and numbering in
all about  birds they flew directly south at a moderate height
and were almost certainly detachments of one body the bluebird movement
was two days later at about the same hour the morning being cold with
a little snow falling this time too as it happened the flock was in
four detachments three of these were too compact to be counted as they
passed the fourth and largest one was in looser order and contained a
little more than a hundred individuals in all as well as I could
guess there might have been about three hundred birds they kept a
straight course southward flying high and with the usual calls which
in autumn at least always have to my ears a sound of farewell was it a
mere coincidence that these swallows bluebirds and robins were all
crossing the valley just at this point

this question too I count it safer to ask than to answer but all
observers I am sure must have remarked so much as this that birds
even on their migrations are subject to strong local preferences an
ornithologist of the highest repute assures me that his own experience
has convinced him so strongly of this fact that if the shoots a rare
migrant in a certain spot the makes it a rule to visit the place again a
year afterward on the same day and if possible at the same hour of
the day another friend sends me a very pretty story bearing upon the
same point the bird of which the speaks wilsons black-cap warbler is
one of the less common of our regular massachusetts migrants I count
myself fortunate if I see two or three specimens during its spring or
autumn passage my correspondent shall tell the story for himself

while I was making the drawings for the silva at the old dwight
house I was in the habit of taking a turn every pleasant day in the
gardens after my scanty lunch on the th of may  in my daily
round I saw a wilsons black-cap for the first time in my life the was
in a bush of _spiræa media_ which grew in the midst of the rockery and
allowed me to examine him at near range with no appearance of fear
naturally I made a note of the occurrence in my diary and talked about
it with my family when I got home the seeing of a new bird always makes
a red-letter day

the next spring as I was looking over my notebook of the previous
year I came upon my entry of may th and thought I would be on the
lookout for a black-cap on that date several times during the morning i
thought of the matter and after my lunch I sauntered into the rockery
just as I had done the year before imagine my start when there in the
very same bush was the black-cap peering at me and I found on looking
at my watch that it was precisely the same hour half past one i
rubbed my eyes and pinched myself to make sure it was not a dream no
it was all real of course I thought the coincidence very singular and
talked about it not only with my family but also with other people
you must remember that I had never seen the bird elsewhere

well another spring came round the th of may was fixed in my mind
and I thought many times of my black-cap I called it _my_ black-cap
now and wondered if it would keep tryst again on the morning of the
th the first thing I thought of when I awoke was my black-cap that
forenoon I actually felt nervous as the time approached for I felt a
sort of certainty you smile that I should see my bird again my lunch
was hastier than usual and I was about to sally forth when it flashed
across me suppose the bird should be there again who would believe my
story hold I will have a witness I called to mr j   who was at
work upstairs and after explaining what I wanted invited him to
accompany me we cautiously entered the rockery and within a few
minutes there flitted from a neighboring thicket into that very spiræa
bush my black-cap I took out my watch it was just half past one

my own experiences in this kind have been much less striking and
dramatic than the foregoing but I may add that a few years ago i
witnessed the vernal migration in a new piece of country ten miles or
so from my old field and found myself at a very considerable
disadvantage I had never realized till then how much accustomed I had
grown to look for particular birds in particular places and not in
other places of a quite similar character

I speak of witnessing a migration but what we see for the most part
ducks and geese being excepted is not the actual movement northward
or southward we see the stragglers more or less numerous that happen
to have dropped out of the procession in our immediate neighborhood a
flock of sandpipers about the edge of the pond some sparrows by the
roadside a bevy of warblers in the wood and from these signs we infer
the passing of the host

unlike swallows robins bluebirds blackbirds and perhaps most of the
sparrows our smaller wood birds the warblers and vireos especially
appear to move as a general thing in mixed flocks whenever the woods
are full of them as is the case now and then every spring and fall one
of the most striking features of the show is the number of species
represented for the benefit of readers who may never have observed such
a bird wave or rush let me sketch hastily one which occurred a few
years ago on the d of september as I started out at six oclock in
the morning in a cool northwest wind birds were passing overhead in an
almost continuous stream following a westerly course they were chiefly
warblers but I noted one fairly large flock of purple finches all were
at a good height and the whole movement had the air of a diurnal
migration I could only conjecture that it was the end of the nocturnal
flight so far at least as the warblers were concerned in other
words that the birds on this particular occasion did not finish their
nightly journey till a little after sunrise but if many were still
flying many others had already halted for presently I came to a piece
of thin stunted wood by the roadside and found in it a highly
interesting company almost the first specimen I saw was a connecticut
warbler perched in full view and exposing himself perfectly red-bellied
nuthatches were calling and warblers uncounted were flitting about in
the trees and underbrush a hurried search showed black-polls
black-throated greens blue yellow-backs one redstart one
black-and-white creeper one blackburnian one black-and-yellow one
canadian flycatcher singing lustily one yellow redpoll and one
clearly-marked bay-breast the first yellow-bellied woodpecker of the
season was hammering in a tree over my head and not far away was the
first flock of white-throated sparrows after breakfast I passed the
place again and the only bird to be found was one phoebe within
half a mile of the spot however I came upon at least three goodly
throngs including scarlet tanagers all in yellow and black
black-throated blue warblers pine warblers olive-backed and
gray-cheeked thrushes a flock of chewinks made up exclusively of adult
males so far as I could discover red-eyed vireos one solitary vireo
brown thrashers with more redstarts a second blackburnian and a
second black-and-yellow every company had its complement of chickadees
of the mornings forty species thirteen were warblers and of these
thirteen four were represented by one specimen each for curiositys
sake I may add that a much longer walk that afternoon through the same
and other woods was utterly barren except for two or three flocks of
white-throated sparrows there was no sign whatever that the night
before had brought us a flight

autumnal ornithology may almost be called a science by itself not only
are birds harder to find being silent and harder to recognize in
autumn than in spring but their movements are in themselves more
difficult of observation a few years of note-taking will put one in
possession of the approximate dates of arrival of all our common vernal
migrants every local observer will tell you when to look for each of
the familiar birds of his neighborhood but the will not be half so ready
with information as to the time of the same birds departure ask him
about a few of the commonest the least flycatcher and the oven-bird
or the golden warbler and the maryland yellow-throat the will answer
perhaps that the has seen maryland yellow-throats in early october and
golden warblers in early september but the will very likely add that
these were probably voyagers from the north and that the has never made
out just when his own summer birds take their leave

after the work of nidification is over birds as a rule wander more or
less from their breeding haunts and even if they do not wander they are
likely to become silent if we miss them therefore we are not to
conclude as a matter of course that they have gone south last year
during the early part of the season cuckoos were unusually plentiful
as it seemed to me then I discovered all at once that there were none
to be found after the first of july I neither saw nor heard a cuckoo of
either species had they moved away I do not know but the case may be
taken as an extreme illustration of the uncertainty attaching to the
late-summer doings of birds in general every student must have had
experiences of a sort to make him slow to dogmatize when such points are
in question throughout may and june for example the has heard and seen
wood thrushes in a certain grove after that for a whole month he
hears and sees nothing though the is frequently there the thrushes have
gone so it would seem but then suddenly they are singing again in
the very same trees and the is forced to conclude that they have not
been away but during their period of midsummer silence have eluded his
notice on the whole therefore after making allowance for particular
cases in which we may have more precise information it would be hard i
think to say just when our nocturnal travelers set out on their long
journey as the poet prayed life to do 

        they steal away give little warning
        choose their own time
    say not good-night but in mays brighter clime
        bid us good-morning

their departure bereaves us but all in all it must be accounted a
blessing like the falling of the leaves it touches the heart with a
pleasing sadness a sadness more delicious if one is born to enjoy it
than all the merry-making of springtime and even for the most
unsentimental of naturalists the autumnal season has many a delightful
hour the year is almost done but for the moment the whole feathered
world is in motion and the shortest walk may show him the choicest of
rarities thanks to the passing of the birds his local studies are an
endless pursuit it is now more than forty years that I have paid some
attention to the ornithology of this district without being able to
exhaust the subject says gilbert white new occurrences still arise
as long as any inquiries are kept alive a happy man is the bird-lover
always another species to look for another mystery to solve his
expectations may never be realized but no matter it is the hope not
its fulfillment that makes life worth having how can any new
englander imagine that the has exhausted the possibilities of existence
so long as the has never seen the lincoln finch and the cape may warbler

but I speak as a fool our happiness if we are bird-lovers indeed
waits not upon novelties and rarities all such exceptional bits of
private good fortune let the fates send or withhold as they will the
grand spectacle itself will not fail us even now through all the
northern country the procession is getting under way for the next
three months it will be passing millions upon millions: warblers
sparrows thrushes vireos blackbirds flycatchers wrens kinglets
woodpeckers swallows humming-birds hawks with sandpipers plovers
ducks and geese gulls and who knows how many more night and day week
days and sundays they will be flying: now singly or in little groups
and flitting from one wood or pasture to another now in great
companies and with protracted all-day or all-night flights who could
ask a better stimulus for his imagination than the annual southing of
this mighty host each member of it knows his own time and his own
course on such a day the snipe will be in such a meadow and the golden
plover in such a field some no doubt will lose their way numbers
uncounted will perish by storm and flood numbers more alas by human
agency as I write with the sad note of a bluebird in my ear I can see
the sea-beaches and the marshes lined with guns but the army will push
on they will come to their desired haven for there is a spirit in
birds also and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them

a great blue heron

    why appear you with this ridiculous boldness
                                           shakespeare


the watcher of birds in the bush soon discovers that they have
individual as well as race characteristics they are not things but
persons beings with intellect affections and will and a strong
specific resemblance is found to be consistent with no small measure of
personal variation all robins we say look and act alike but so do
all yankees yet it is part of every yankees birthright to be different
from every other yankee nature abhors a copy it would seem almost as
badly as she abhors a vacuum perhaps if the truth were known a copy
_is_ a vacuum

I walked down the bay shore of cape cod one summer morning and at a
certain point climbed the steep cliff to the railway track meaning to
look into a large cranberry meadow where on previous visits I had
found a few sandpipers and plovers near one end of the perfectly level
sand-covered meadow was a little pool and my first glance in that
direction showed me a great blue heron wading about its edge with as
much quietness as possible I stole out of sight and then hastened up
the railway through a cut till I had the sun at my back and a hill
between me and the bird then I began a stealthy approach keeping
behind one object after another and finally going down flat upon the
ground to roll in the soil is an excellent method of cleansing ones
garments on cape cod and crawling up to a patch of bayberry bushes the
last practicable cover

here let me say that the great blue heron is as its name implies a big
bird standing almost as high as an ordinary man and spreading its
wings for nearly or quite six feet its character for suspiciousness may
be gathered from what different writers have said about it the is most
jealously vigilant and watchful of man says wilson so that those who
wish to succeed in shooting the heron must approach him entirely unseen
and by stratagem extremely suspicious and shy says audubon
unless under very favorable circumstances it is almost hopeless to
attempt to approach it to walk up towards one would be a fruitless
adventure dr brewers language is to the same effect at all times
very vigilant and difficult of approach

this then was the bird which I now had under my field-glass as I lay
at full length behind the friendly bayberry bushes up to this point
for aught that appeared the was quite unaware of my espionage like all
the members of his family that I have ever seen the possessed so much
patience that it required much patience to watch him for minutes
together the stood perfectly still and his movements as a rule were
either so slow as to be all but imperceptible or so rapid as almost to
elude the eye boys who have killed frogs which was pretty certainly my
herons present employment will need no explanation of his behavior
they know very well that if the fatal club is to do its work the
slowest kind of preliminary motion must be followed by something like a
flash of lightning

I watched the bird for perhaps half an hour admiring his handsome blue
wings as now and then the spread them his dainty manner of lifting his
long legs and the occasional flashing stroke of his beak my range was
short for a field-glass I mean and all in all I voted it a fine
show

when I wearied of my position I rose and advanced upon the heron in full
sight expecting every moment to see him fly to my astonishment the held
his ground down the hillside I went nearer and nearer till I came to
a barbed-wire fence which bounded the cranberry field close by the
herons pool as I worried my way through this abominable obstruction
he stepped into a narrow shallow ditch and started slowly away I made
rapidly after him whereupon the got out of the ditch and strode on ahead
of me by this time I was probably within twenty yards of him so near
that as the twisted his long neck every now and then and looked at me
through his big yellow eyes I began to wonder whether the might not take
it into his head to turn the tables upon me a stab in the face with
that ugly sharp beak would have been no laughing matter but I did not
believe myself in any danger and quickened my steps being now highly
curious to see how near the fellow I could get at this the broke into a
kind of dog-trot very comical to witness and if I had not previously
seen him fly a few yards I should have supposed him disabled in the
wing dr brewer by the way says that this bird is never known to
run or even to walk briskly but such negative assertions are always
at the makers risk

he picked up his legs at last for I pressed him closer and closer till
there could not have been more than forty or fifty feet between us but
even then the settled down again beside another pool only a few rods
further on in the same meadow and there I left him to pursue his
frog-hunt unmolested the ludicrousness of the whole affair was enhanced
by the fact already mentioned that the ground was perfectly flat and
absolutely without vegetation except for the long rows of newly planted
cranberry vines as to what could have influenced the bird to treat me
thus strangely I have no means of guessing as we say of each others
freaks and oddities it was _his way_ I suppose the might have behaved
otherwise of course had I been armed but of that I felt by no means
certain at the time and my doubts were strengthened by an occurrence
which happened a month or so afterward

I was crossing the beach at nahant with a friend when we stole upon a
pair of golden plovers birds that both of us were very happy to see
the splendid old-gold spotting of their backs was plain enough but
immature black-bellied plovers are adorned in a similar manner and it
was necessary for us to see the rumps of our birds before we could be
sure of their identity so after we had scrutinized them as long as we
wished I asked my companion to put them up while I should keep my glass
upon their backs and make certain of the color of their rumps as they
opened their wings we were already within a very few paces of them but
they ran before him as the advanced and in the end the had almost to
tread on them

the golden plover is not so unapproachable as the great blue heron i
suppose but from what sportsmen tell me about him I am confident that
he cannot be in the habit of allowing men to chase him along the beach
at a distance of five or six yards and it is to be added that in the
present instance my companion had a gun in his hand

possibly all these birds would have behaved differently another day
even in what to us might have seemed exactly the same circumstances
undoubtedly too it is easier as an almost universal rule to approach
one or two birds than a considerable flock in the larger body there are
almost certain to be a few timorous souls a few wider-awake and better
instructed souls let us rather say who by their outcries and hasty
flight will awaken all the others to a sense of possible danger but it
is none the less true as I said to begin with that individual birds
have individual ways and my great blue heron I am persuaded was a
character it would be worth something to know what was passing behind
those big yellow eyes as the twisted his neck to look once more at the
curious fellow curious in two senses who was keeping after him so
closely was the heron curious as well as his pursuer or was the only a
little set in his own way a little resentful of being imposed upon a
little inclined to withstand the tyrant of his fields just for
principles sake as patriots ought to do or was the a young fellow in
whom heredity had mysteriously omitted to load the bump of caution and
upon whom experience had not yet enforced the lesson that if a creature
is taller and stronger than you are it is prudent to assume that he
will most likely think it a pleasant bit of sport to kill you it is
nothing to the credit of humankind that the sight of an unsuspicious
bird in a marsh or on the beach should have become a subject for
wonder




flowers and folks

    to know one element explore another
     and in the second reappears the first
                                    emerson


every order of intelligent beings naturally separates the world into two
classes itself and the remainder birds for instance have no doubt a
feeling more or less clearly defined which if it were translated into
human speech might read birds and nature we in our turn say man
and nature but such distinctions useful as they are and therefore
admissible are none the less arbitrary and liable to mislead birds and
men are alike parts of nature having many things in common not only
with each other but with every form of animate existence the world is
not a patchwork though never so cunningly put together but a garment
woven throughout

the importance of this truth its far-reaching and many-sided
significance is even yet only beginning to be understood but its
bearing upon the study of what we call natural history would seem to be
evident my own experience as a dabbler in botany and ornithology has
convinced me that the pursuit of such researches is not at all out of
the spirit of the familiar line 

    the proper study of mankind is man 

whatever the author of the line may have himself intended by his
apothegm to become acquainted with the peculiarities of plants or birds
is to increase ones knowledge of beings of his own sort

there is room I think for a treatise on analogical botany a study of
the human nature of plants thoroughly and sympathetically done the
work would be both surprising and edifying it would give us a better
opinion of plants and possibly a poorer opinion of ourselves some
wholesome first lessons of this kind we have all taken as a matter of
course we all do fade as a leaf all flesh is grass and all the
goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field there are no
household words more familiar than such texts but the work of which i
am thinking will deal not so much with our likeness to tree and herb as
with the likeness of tree and herb to us and furthermore it will go
into the whole subject systematically and at length meanwhile it is
open even to an amateur to offer something in a general and discursive
way upon so inviting a theme and especially to call attention to its
scope and variety

as I sit at my desk the thistles are in their glory and in a vase at
my elbow stands a single head of the tall swamp variety along with a
handful of fringed gentians forgetting what it is one cannot help
pronouncing the thistle beautiful a close bunch of minute rose-purple
flowers but who could ever feel toward it as toward the gentian beauty
is a thing not merely of form and color but of memory and association
the thistle is an ugly customer in a single respect it lays itself out
to be agreeable but even its beauty is too much like that of some
venomous reptile yet it has its friends or at all events its patrons
if you wish to catch butterflies go to the thistle pasture and no
doubt could give forty eloquent and logical excuses for its offensive
traits probably it felicitates itself upon its shrewdness and pities
the poor estate of its defenseless neighbors how they must envy its
happier fortune it sees them browsed upon by the cattle and can hardly
be blamed if it chuckles a little to itself as the greedy creatures pass
it by untouched school-girls and botanists break down the golden-rods
and asters and pull up the gerardias and ladies-tresses but neither
school-girl nor collector often troubles the thistle it opens its
gorgeous blossoms and ripens its feathery fruit unmolested truly it is
a great thing to wear an armor of prickles

the human nature of plants have I any reader so innocent as not to
feel at this moment the appropriateness of the phrase can there be one
so favored as not to have some unmistakable thistles among his christian
townsmen and acquaintance nay we all know them they are the more
easily discovered for standing always a little by themselves they
escape many slight inconveniences under which more amiable people
suffer whoever finds himself in a hard place goes not to them for
assistance they are recognized afar as persons to be let alone yet
they too like their floral representatives have a good side if they
do not give help they seldom ask it once a year they may actually do
a handsome thing as the common expression is but they cannot put off
their own nature their very generosity pricks the hand that receives
it and when old time cuts them down with his scythe what should we do
without this famous husbandman unkindly as we talk of him there will
be no great mourning

is it then an unpardonable misdemeanor for a plant to defend itself
against attack and extermination has the duty of non-resistance no
exceptions nor abatements in the vegetable kingdom that would be indeed
a hard saying for what would become of our universal favorite the
rose on this point there may be room for a diversity of opinion but
for one I cannot wish the wild rose disarmed lest through the
recklessness of its admirers what is now one of the commonest of our
wayside ornaments should grow to be a rarity I esteem the rose a
patrician and fairly entitled to patrician manners as every one sees
people in high station especially if they chance to possess attractive
social qualities are of necessity compelled to discountenance
everything like careless familiarity even from those with whom they may
formerly have been most intimate they must always stand more or less
upon ceremony and never be handled without gloves so it is with the
queen of flowers its thorns not only serve it as a protection but are
for its admirers an excellent discipline in forbearance they make it
easier for us as emerson says to love the wood rose and leave it on
the stalk in addition to which I am moved to say that the rose like
the holly illustrates a truth too seldom insisted upon namely that
people are more justly condemned for the absence of all good qualities
than for the presence of one or two bad ones

some such plea as this though with a smaller measure of assurance i
should make in behalf of plants like the barberry and the bramble the
latter in truth sometimes acts as if it were not so much fighting us
off as drawing us on leaning far forward and stretching forth its arms
it buttonholes the wayfarer so to speak and with generous country
insistence forces upon him the delicious clusters which the in his
preoccupation seemed in danger of passing untasted I think I know the
human counterparts of both barberry and bramble excellent people in
their place though not to be chosen for bosom friends without a careful
weighing of consequences judging them not by their manners but by
their fruits we must set them on the right hand it would go hard with
some of the most pious of my neighbors I imagine if the presence of a
few thorns and prickles were reckoned inconsistent with a moderately
good character

as for reprobates like the so-called poison ivy and poison dogwood
they have perhaps borrowed a familiar human maxim all is fair in
war in any case they are no worse than savage heathen who kill their
enemies with poisoned arrows or than civilized christians who stab the
reputation of their friends with poisoned words their marked comeliness
of habit may be taken as a point in their favor or on the contrary it
may be held to make their case only so much the blacker by laying them
liable to the additional charge of hypocrisy the question is a nice
one and I gladly leave it for subtler casuists than I to settle

how refreshing to turn from all these from the thistle and the bramble
yea even from the rose itself to gentle spirits like the violet and
anemone the arbutus and hepatica these wage no war they are of the
original society of friends who will may spoil them without hurt their
defense is with their maker I wonder whether anybody ever thinks of
such flowers as representative of any order of grown people or whether
to everybody else they are forever children as I find on thinking of
it they have always been to me lowly and trustful sweet and frail
of such is the kingdom of heaven they pass away without losing their
innocence ere the first heats of summer they are gone

yet the autumn too has its delicate blooms though they are
overshadowed and as it were put out of countenance by the coarser
growths which must be said to characterize the harvest season nothing
that may puts into her lap is more exquisite than are the purple
gerardias with which august and september embroider the pasture and the
woodland road they have not the sweet breath of the arbutus nor even
the faint elusive odor of the violet but for daintiness of form
perfection of color and gracefulness of habit it would be impossible to
praise them too highly of our three species my own favorite is the one
of the narrow leaves _gerardia tenuifolia_ its longer and slighter
flower-stems giving it an airiness and grace peculiarly its own a lady
to whom I had brought a handful the other day expressed it well when she
said they look like fairy flowers they are of my mind in this: they
love a dry sunny opening in the woods or a grassy field on the edge of
woods especially if there be a seldom-used path running through it i
know not with what human beings to compare them perhaps their antitypes
of our own kind are yet to be evolved but I have before now seen a
woman who might worthily be set in their company a person whose sweet
and wise actions were so gracefully carried and so easily let fall as to
suggest an order and quality of goodness quite out of relation to common
flesh and blood

what a contrast between such lowly-minded unobtrusive beauties and
egotists like our multitudinous asters and golden-rods these between
them almost take possession of the world for the two or three months of
their reign they are handsome and they know it what is beauty for if
not to be admired they mass their tiny blossoms first into solid heads
then into panicles and racemes and have no idea of hiding their
constellated brightness under a bushel let your light shine is the
word they go on how eagerly they crowd along the roadside till the
casual passer-by can see scarce anything else if the does not see
_them_ it is not their fault

for myself I am far from wishing them at all less numerous or a jot
less forward in displaying their charms let there be variety I say
because I speak well of the violet for its humility I see no reason why
I should quarrel with the aster for loving to make a show herein too
plants are like men an indisposition toward publicity is amiable in
those to whom it is natural but I am not clear that bashfulness is the
only commendable quality let plants and men alike carry themselves
according to their birthright providence has not ordained a diversity
of gifts for nothing and it is only a narrow philosophy that takes
offense at seeming contrarieties the truer method and the happier as
well is to like each according to its kind: to love that which is
amiable to admire that which is admirable and to study that which is
curious

a few weeks ago for example I walked again up the mountain road that
climbs out of the franconia valley into the franconia notch I had left
home twenty-four hours before fresh from working upon the asters and
golden-rods trying to straighten out my local catalogue in accordance
with dr grays more recent classification of these large and difficult
genera and naturally enough had asters and golden-rods still in my
eye the first mile or two afforded nothing of particular note but by
and by I came to a cluster of the sturdy and peculiar _solidago
squarrosa_ and was taking an admiring account of its appearance and
manner of growth when I caught sight of some lower blue flower
underneath which on a second glance proved to be the closed gentian
this grew in hiding as one might say in the shadow of its taller and
showier neighbors not far off but a little more within the wood were
patches of the linnæa which had been at its prettiest in june but even
now in late september was still putting forth scattered blossoms what
should a man do discard the golden-rod for the gentian and in turn
forsake the gentian for the twin-flower nay a child might do that but
not a man for the three were all beautiful and all interesting and
each the more beautiful and interesting for its unlikeness to the
others if one wishes a stiff lesson in classification there are few
harder genera among flowering plants than _solidago_ if the would
investigate the timely and taking question of the dependence of plants
upon insects this humble proterandrous gentian which to human vision
seems closed but which the humble-bee knows well how to enter offers
him a favorable subject while if the has an eye for beauty a nose for
delicate fragrance and a soul for poetry the linnæa will never cease
to be one of his prime favorites so I say again let us have variety
it would be a stupid town all whose inhabitants should be of identical
tastes and habits though these were of the very best and it would be a
tiresome country that brought forth only a single kind of plants

the flower of linnæus is a flower by itself as here and there appears a
man who seems as we say _suI generis_ this familiar phrase by the
bye is literally applicable to _linnæa borealis_ a plant that spreads
over a large part of the northern hemisphere but everywhere preserves
its own specific character so that whether it be found in greenland or
in maryland on the alaskan islands or in utah in siberia or on the
mountains of scotland it is always and everywhere the same a genus of
one species diversities of soil and climate make no impression upon its
originality if it live at all it must live according to its own plan

the aster on the contrary has a special talent for variation like
some individuals of another sort it is born to adapt itself to
circumstances dr gray enumerates no less than one hundred and
ninety-six north american species and varieties many of which shade
into each other with such endless and well-nigh insensible gradations
that even our great special student of the _compositæ_ pronounces the
accurate and final classification of this particular genus a labor
beyond his powers what shall we say of this habit of variability is it
a mark of strength or of weakness which is nobler to be true to ones
ideal in spite of circumstances or to conquer circumstances by suiting
ones self to them who shall decide enough that the twin-flower and
the star-flower each obeys its own law and in so doing contributes each
its own part toward making this world the place of diversified beauty
which it was foreordained to be

I spoke of the linnæas autumnal blossoms though its normal flowering
time is in june even this steady-going unimpressible citizen of the
world it appears has its one bit of freakishness in these bright
summery september days when the trees put on their glory this lowliest
member of the honeysuckle family feels a stirring within to make itself
beautiful and being an evergreen instead of a summer-green and
therefore incapable of bedecking itself after the maples manner it
sends up a few flower-stems each with its couple of swinging fragrant
bells so it bids the world good-by till the long winter once more comes
and goes

the same engaging habit is noticeable in the case of some of our very
commonest plants after the golden-rods and asters have had their day
late in october or well into november when witch-hazel yarrow and
clover are almost the only blossoms left us you will stumble here and
there upon a solitary dandelion reflecting the sun or a violet giving
back the color of the sky and even so you may find once in a while
an old man in whom imaginative impulses have sprung up anew now that
all the prosaic activities of middle life are over it is almost as if
he were born again the song of the april robin the blossoming of the
apple-tree the splendors of sunset and sunrise these and things like
them touch him to pleasure as the now remembers they used to do years
and years ago what means this strange revival of youth in age is it a
reminiscence merely a final flickering of the candle or is it rather a
prophecy of life yet to come well with the dandelion and the violet we
know with reasonable certainty how the matter stands the autumnal
blooms are not belated but precocious they belong not to the season
past but to the season coming who shall forbid us to hope that what is
true of the violet will prove true also of the man

it speaks well for human nature that in the long run the lowliest
flowers are not only the best loved but the oftenest spoken of men
play the cynic: modest merit goes to the wall they say whoever would
succeed let him put on a brazen face and sharpen his elbows but those
who talk in this strain deceive neither themselves nor those who listen
to them they are commonly such as have themselves tried the trumpet and
elbow method and have discovered that whatever may be true of
transient notoriety neither public fame nor private regard is to be won
by such means we do not retract what we have said in praise of
diversity and about the right of each to live according to its own
nature but we gladly perceive that in the case of the flowers also it
is the meek that inherit the earth

our appreciation of our fellow-men depends in part upon the amount but
still more upon the quality of the service they render us we could
get along without poets more comfortably than without cobblers for the
lower use is often first in order both of time and of necessity but we
are never in doubt as to their relative place in our esteem one serves
the body the other the soul and we reward the one with money the
other with affection and reverence and our estimation of plants is
according to the same rule such of them as nourish the body are
good good even to the point of being indispensable but as we make a
difference between the barnyard fowl and the nightingale and between
the common run of humanity and a beethoven or a milton so maize and
potatoes are never put into the same category with lilies and violets
it must be so because man is more than an animal and the life is more
than meat

again we say let each fulfill its own function one is made for
utility another for beauty for plants too are specialists they know
as well as men how to make the most of inherited capacities and
aptitudes achieving distinction at last by the simple process of
sticking to one thing whether that be the production of buds
blossoms berries leaves bark timber or what not and our judgment
of them must be correspondingly varied the vine bears blossoms but is
to be rated not by them but by the grapes that come after them and the
rose-tree bears hips but takes its rank not from them but from the
flowers that went to the making of them nothing but leaves is a
verdict unfavorable or otherwise according to its application the
tea-shrub would hold up its head to hear it

one of the most interesting and suggestive points of difference among
plants is that which relates to the matter of self-reliance some are
made to stand alone others to twine and others to creep if it were
allowable to attribute human feelings to them we should perhaps be safe
in assuming that the upright look down upon the climbers and the
climbers in turn upon the creepers for who of us does not felicitate
himself upon his independence such as it is or such as the imagines it
to be but if independence is indeed a boon and I for one am too
thoroughbred a new englander ever to doubt it it is not the only good
nor even the highest the nettle standing straight and prim asking no
favors of anybody may rail at the grape-vine which must lay hold of
something small matter what by which to steady itself but the nettle
might well be willing to forego somewhat of its self-sufficiency if by
so doing it could bring forth grapes the smilax also with its thorns
its pugnacious habit and its stony juiceless berries a sort of
handsome vixen among vines the smilax which can climb though it
cannot stand erect has little occasion to lord it over the strawberry
if one has done nothing or worse than nothing it is hardly worth while
to boast of the original fashion in which the has gone about it
moreover the very plants of which we are speaking bear witness to the
fact that it is possible to accept help and still retain to the full
ones own individuality the strawberry is no more a plagiarist than the
smilax nor the grape than the nettle if the vine clings to the cedar
the connection is but mechanical its spirit and life are as independent
of the savin as of the planet jupiter even the dodder which not only
twines about other weeds but actually sucks its life from them does
not thereby lose an iota of its native character if a man is only
original to begin with so the parable seems to run the is under a
kind of necessity to remain so as shakespeare did no matter how much
help the may draw from alien sources

this truth of the vegetable world is the more noteworthy because along
with it there goes a very strong and persistent habit of individual
variation the plant is faithful to the spirit of its inherited law but
is not in bondage to the letter our high-bush blackberries to take a
familiar illustration are all of one species but it does not follow
that they are all exactly alike so far from it I knew in my time and
the school-boys of the present day are not less accurately informed we
may presume where to find berries of all shapes sizes and flavors
some were sour and some were bitter and some I can taste them yet
were finger-shaped and sweet and what is true of _rubus villosus_ is
probably true of all plants though in varying degrees I do not recall
a single article of our annual wild crop blueberries huckleberries
blackberries cherries grapes pig-nuts a bad name for a good thing
shagbarks acorns and so forth in which there was not this constant
inequality among plants of the same species perfectly well defined and
never lost sight of by us juvenile connoisseurs if we failed to find
the same true of other vines and bushes which for our purposes bore
blossoms only the explanation is not far to seek our perceptions
æsthetic and gastronomic were unequally developed we were in the case
of the man to whom a poet is a poet though the knows very well that
there are cooks and cooks

it is this slight but everywhere present admixture of the personal
quality call it individuality or what you will that saves the world
animal and vegetable alike from stagnation every bush every bird
every man together with its unmistakable and ineradicable likeness to
the parent stock has received also a something be it more or less
that distinguishes it from all its fellows let our observation be
delicate enough and we shall perceive that there are no duplicates of
any kind the world over it is part of the very unity of the world
this universally diffused diversity

it does a sympathetic observer good to see how humanly plants differ in
their likes and dislikes one is catholic: as common people say it is
not particular it can live and thrive almost anywhere another must
have precisely such and such conditions and is to be found therefore
only in very restricted localities the _dionæa_ or venuss fly-trap
is a famous example of this fastidiousness growing in a small district
of north carolina and as far as appears nowhere else a highly
specialized plant with no generic relative another instance is
furnished by a water lily _nymphæa elegans_ the rediscovery of which
is chronicled in a late issue of one of our botanical journals
this lily was originally found in  and has never been seen since
holding its place in botanical literature for these almost forty years
on the strength of a single collection at a single vaguely described
station on the broad prairies of southwestern texas now after all
this time it turns up again in another quarter of the same state and
every student could report cases of a similar character though less
striking than these of course within the limits of his own local
researches if you ask me where I find dandelions I answer anywhere
but if you wish me to show you the sweet colts-foot _nardosmia
palmata_ you must go with me to one particular spot any of my
neighbors will tell you where the pink moccasin flower grows but if it
is the yellow one you are in search of I shall swear you to secrecy
before conducting you to its swampy hiding-place some plants like some
people but the plants be it noted are mostly weeds seem to flourish
best away from home others die under the most careful transplanting
some are lovers of the open and cannot be too much in the sun others
lurk in deep woods under the triple shadow of tree and bush and fern
some take to sandy hill-tops others must stand knee-deep in water one
insists upon the richest of meadow loam another is content with the
face of a rock we may say of them as truly as of ourselves _de
gustibus non est disputandum_ otherwise how would the earth ever be
clothed with verdure

but plants are subject to other whims not less pronounced than these
which have to do with the choice of a dwelling-place we may call it the
general rule that leaves come before flowers but how many of our trees
and shrubs reverse this order the singular habit of the witch-hazel
whose blossoms open as the leaves fall may be presumed to be familiar
to all readers and hardly less curious is the freak of the chestnut
which almost if not quite alone among our amentaceous trees does not
put on its splendid coronation robes till late in june and is
frequently at the height of its magnificence in mid-july what a pretty
piece of variety have we again in the diurnal and the nocturnal
bloomers for my own part being a watcher of birds and therefore
almost of necessity an early stirrer abroad I profess a special regard
for such plants as save their beauty for night-time and cloudy weather
the evening primrose is no favorite with most people I take it but i
seldom fail to pick a blossom or two with the dew on them those to whom
I carry them usually exclaim as over some wonderful exotic though the
primrose is an inveterate haunter of the roadside yet its blossoms
have only to be looked at and smelled of to make their way homely as is
the stalk that produces them they love darkness rather than light but
it certainly is not because their deeds are evil one might as well
cast the opprobrious text in the face of the moon and stars now and
then some enterprising journalist for want of better employment
investigates anew the habits of literary workers and it invariably
transpires that some can do their best only by daylight while the minds
of others seem to be good for nothing till the sun goes down and the
wise reader who reads not so much to gain information as to see whether
the writer tells the truth shakes his head and says oh it is all in
use of course it is all in use just as it is with whippoorwills and
the morning-glory

the mention of the evening primrose calls for the further remark that
plants not less than ourselves have a trick of combining opposite
qualities a coarse-grained and scraggy habit for instance with
blossoms of exquisite fragrance and beauty the most gorgeous flowers
sometimes exhale an abominable odor and it is not unheard of that
inconspicuous or even downright homely sorts should be accounted
precious for their sweetness while as everybody knows few members of
our native flora are more graceful in appearance than the very two whose
simple touch is poison could anything be more characteristic of human
nature than just such inconsistencies suavity and trickery harshness
and integrity a fiery temper and a gentle heart how often do we see
the good and the bad dwelling together we would have ordered things
differently I dare say had they been left to us the good should have
been all good and the bad all bad and yet if it be a grief to feel
that the holiest men have their failings it ought perhaps to be a
consolation rather than an additional sorrow to perceive that the most
vicious are not without their virtues beyond which shall we presume to
suggest that as poisons have their use so moral evil give it time
enough may turn out to be not altogether a curse

I have treated my subject too fancifully I fear indeed there comes
over me at this moment a sudden suspicion that my subject itself is
nothing but a fancy or worse yet a profanation if the flowers could
talk who knows how earnestly they might deprecate all such misguided
attempts at doing them honor as if it were anything but a slander
this imputation to them of the foibles or even the self-styled good
qualities of our poor humanity what an egoist is man I seem to hear
them saying look where the will at the world or at its creator the sees
nothing but the reflection of his own image




in praise of the weymouth pine

    I seek in the motion of the forest in the sound of the
     pines some accents of the eternal language
                                                  senancour


I could never think it surprising that the ancients worshiped trees
that groves were believed to be the dwelling places of the gods that
xerxes delighted in the great plane-tree of lydia that the decked it
with golden ornaments and appointed for it a sentry one of the
immortal ten thousand feelings of this kind are natural among natural
men they seem to have been well-nigh universal the wonder is that any
should be without them for myself I cannot recollect the day when i
did not regard the weymouth pine the white pine I was taught to call
it but now for reasons of my own I prefer the english name with
something like reverence especially was this true of one a tree of
stupendous girth and height under which I played and up which i
climbed till my cap seemed almost to rub against the sky that pine
ought to be standing yet I would go far to lie in its shadow but alas
no village xerxes concerned himself for its safety and long long ago
it was brought to earth it and all its fair lesser companions there is
no wisdom in the grave and it is nothing to them now that I remember
them so kindly some of them went to the making of boxes I suppose
some to the kindling of kitchen fires in like noble spirit did the
illustrious bobo for the love of roast pig burn down his fathers
house

no such pines are to be seen now I have said it for these twenty years
and mean no offense surely to the one under which in thankful mood i
happen at this moment to be reclining yet a murmur runs through its
branches as I pencil the words perhaps it is saying to itself that
giants are and always have been things of the past things gazed at
over the beholders shoulder and through the mists of years and that
this venerable monarch of my boyhood this relic of times remote has
probably grown faster since it was cut down than ever it did while
standing I care not to argue the point rather let me be glad that a
tree is a tree whether large or small what a wonder of wonders it
would seem to unaccustomed eyes as some lover of imaginative delights
wished that the could forget shakespeare and read him new so I would
cheerfully lose all memory of my king of weymouth pines if by that
means I might for once look upon a tree as upon something I had never
seen or dreamed of

for that purpose were it given me to choose I would have one that had
grown by itself full of branches on all sides but with no suggestion
of primness in short a perfect tree a miracle hardly to be found in
any forest since the forest would be no better than a park if the
separate members of it were allowed room to develop each after its own
law nature is too cunning an artist to spoil the total effect of her
picture by too fond a regard for the beauty of particular details

I once passed a lazy dreamy afternoon in a small clearing on a canadian
mountain-side where the lumbermen had left standing a few scattered
butternuts I can see them now misshapen giants patriarchal
monstrosities their huge trunks leaning awkwardly this way and that
and each bearing at the top a ludicrously small one-sided bunch of
leafy boughs all about me was the ancient wood for a week I had been
wandering through it with delight such beeches and maples birches and
butternuts I had not thought of any imperfection I had been in
sympathy with the artist and had enjoyed his work in the same spirit in
which it had been wrought now however with these unhappy butternuts
in my eye I began to look not at the forest but at the trees and i
found that the spared butternuts were in no sense exceptional _all_ the
trees were deformed they had grown as they could not as their innate
proclivities would have led them a tree is no better than a man it
cannot be itself if it stands too much in a crowd

I set it down unwillingly to the discredit of the weymouth pine a
symptom of some ancestral taint perhaps that it suffers less than
most trees from being thus encroached upon yet it does not entirely
escape true it leans neither to left nor right its trunk is seldom
contorted if it grow at all it must grow straight toward the zenith
but it is sadly maimed nevertheless hardly more than a tall stick
with a broom at the top if you would see a typical white pine you must
go elsewhere to look for it I remember one such standing by itself in
a broad concord river meadow not remarkable for its size but of a
symmetry and beauty that make the traveler turn again and again till he
is a mile away to gaze upon it no pine-tree ever grew like that in a
wood

I go sometimes through a certain hamlet which has sprung suddenly into
being on a hill-top where formerly stood a pine grove the builders of
the houses have preserved doubtless they use that word a goodly number
of the trees but though I have been wont to esteem the poorest tree as
better than none I am almost ready to forswear my opinion at sight of
these slender trunks so ungainly and unsupported the first breeze one
would say must bring them down upon the roofs they were never meant to
shade poor naked things I fancy they look abashed at being dragged
thus unexpectedly and inappropriately into broad daylight if I were to
see the householder lifting his axe against one of them I think I should
not say woodman spare _that_ tree let it go to the fire the sooner
the better and be out of its misery

not that I blame the tree or the power that made it what it is the
forest like every other community prospers we may rather say
exists at the expense of individual perfection but the expense is true
economy for however it may be in ethics in æsthetics the end
justifies the means the solitary pine unhindered symmetrical green
to its lowermost twig as it rises out of the meadow or stands a-tiptoe
on the rocky ledge is a thing of beauty a pleasure to every eye a
pity and a shame that it should not be more common but the pine
_forest_ dark spacious slumberous musical here is something better
than beauty dearer than pleasure when we enter this cathedral unless
we enter it unworthily we speak not of such things every tree may be
imperfect with half its branches dead for want of room or want of sun
but until the devotee turns critic an easy step alas for
half-hearted worshipers we are conscious of no lack magnificence can
do without prettiness and a touch of solemnity is better than any
amusement

where shall we hear better preaching more searching comment upon life
and death than in this same cathedral verily the pine is a priest of
the true religion it speaks never of itself never its own words
silent it stands till the spirit breathes upon it then all its
innumerable leaves awake and speak as they are moved then the that hath
ears to hear let him hear wonderful is human speech the work of
generations upon generations each striving to express itself its
feelings its thoughts its needs its sufferings its joys its
inexpressible desires wonderful is human speech for its complexity
its delicacy its power but the pine-tree under the visitations of the
heavenly influence utters things incommunicable it whispers to us of
things we have never said and never can say things that lie deeper
than words deeper than thought blessed are our ears if we hear for
the message is not to be understood by every comer nor indeed by
any except at happy moments in this temple all hearing is given by
inspiration for which reason the pine-trees language is inarticulate
as jesus spake in parables

the pine wood loves a clean floor and is intolerant of undergrowth
grasses and sedges with all bushes it frowns upon as a model
housekeeper frowns upon dirt a plain brown carpet suits it best with a
modest figure of green preferably of evergreen woven into it a
tracery of partridge-berry vine or it may be of club moss with here
and there a tuft of pipsissewa and pyrola its mood is sombre its taste
severe yet I please myself with noticing that the pine wood like the
rest of us is not without its freak its amiable inconsistency its one
tender spot as we say of each other it makes a pet of one of our
oddest brightest and showiest flowers the pink ladys-slipper and by
some means or other has enticed it away from the peat bog where it
surely should be growing along with the calopogon the pogonia and the
arethusa and here it is like some rare exotic thriving in a bed of
sand and on a mat of brown needles who will undertake to explain the
occult elective affinity by which this rosy orchid is made so much at
home under the heavy shadow of the weymouth pine

according to the common saying there is no accounting for tastes if by
this is meant simply that _we_ cannot account for them the statement is
true enough but if we are to speak exactly there are no likes nor
dislikes except for cause every freak of taste like every vagary of
opinion has its origin and history and with sufficient knowledge on
our part could be explained and justified the pine-tree and the orchid
are not friends by accident however the case may look to us who cannot
see behind the present nor beneath the surface there are no mysteries
_per se_ but only to the ignorant yet ignorance itself disparagingly
as we talk of it has its favorable side as it is pleasant sometimes
to withdraw from the sun and wander for a season in the half-light of
the forest perhaps we need be in no haste to reach a world where there
is never any darkness in some moods at least I go with the
partridge-berry vine and the ladys-slipper it is good I think to
live awhile longer in the shadow to see as through a glass darkly and
to hear overhead not plain words but inarticulate murmurs

I am not to be understood as praising the pine at the expense of other
trees all things considered no evergreen can be equal to a
summer-green on which we see the leaves budding unfolding ripening
and falling a worlde whiche neweth everie daie what would winter be
worth without the naked branches of maples and elms beeches and oaks
we speak of them sadly:

    bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang

but the sadness is of a pleasing sort that could ill be spared by any
who know the pleasures of sentiment and sober reflection but though one
tree differeth from another tree in glory we may surely rejoice in them
all one ministers to our mood to-day another to-morrow

    I hate those trees that never lose their foliage
     they seem to have no sympathy with nature
     winter and summer are alike to them

so says ternissa in landors dialogue I know what she means but I do
not hate an impassive unchangeable temper whether in a tree or in a
man I have so little of such a spirit myself that I am glad to see
some tokens of it not too frequent indeed nor too self-assertive in
the world about me and so I say let me never be for any long time
together where there are no weymouth pines at which I may gaze from
afar or under which I may lie and listen they boast not rare
stoics but they set us a brave example no blasts that blow the
poplar white can cause the pine-tree to blanch no frost has power to
strip it of a single leaf its wood is soft but how dauntless its
spirit a truly encouraging paradox lending itself at our private
need to endless consolatory moralizings the great majority of my
brothers must be comforted I think by any fresh reminder that the
battle is not to the strong

for myself then like the lowly partridge-berry vine I would be always
the pine-trees neighbor who knows but by lifelong fellowship with it i
may absorb something of its virtue summer and winter its fragrant
breath rises to heaven and of it we may say with more truth than
landor said of the over-sweet fragrance of the linden happy the man
whose aspirations are pure enough to mingle with it
