last night the great bird
was steady in his boat
i have got my shit together
and i am ready to go
oh but they way i been acting
i’d have to be lucky
last night the gray moon
i’m right down in this hole
how on earth did you get down here?
you say you know that still ain’t clear
but i have my shit together
and i was ready to go
i must be doing something wrong
gonna say this once for the both of us
there’s a lot of people out there you can’t trust
there’s a lot of people out there who don’t trust us
just get your shit together
get ready to go
everybody’s doing something wrong 
dark don't hide it
something held me down it made me make a promise
that i wouldn't tell if the truth forgets about us
saying it now comes easily
after finding out how you've been using me
at least the dark don't hide it
you only said you wanted friends
for long enough to get rid of them
you found the kind you knew would only kill you
so you surrounded yourself with them
at least the dark don't hide it
now the world was empty on the day when they made it
but heaven needed someplace to throw all the shit
human hearts and pain should never be separate
they wouldn't tear themselves apart both trying to fit
at least the dark don't hide it
now death is gonna hold us up in the mirror
and say we're so much alike we must be brothers
see i had a job to do but people like you
been doing it for me to one another
at least i don't hide it

night shift lullabye lay down
lay down lay down
no more running round
sleep away the morning hours
lay down lay down
sparrow sing ears ring
my baby doesn't hear a thing
work that long old night away
lay down sleep another day
lay down lay down
no more running round
sleep away the morning hours
lay down lay down
every muscle vein and bone
answers to that endless drone
i can hear my old machine
still running even in my dreams
lay down lay down
no more running round
sleep away the morning hours
lay down lay down

leave the city
broke my heart to leave the city
i mean it broke what wasn't broken in there already
thought of all my great reasons for leaving
now i can't think of any
it's true it was a hard time that i've come through
it's made me thankful for the blues
half my life spent on a highway
half my life i didn't choose
and i have seen the north star
shining in the freight yard
and i knew it was a hard time that it'd come through
it's made him thankful for the blues
it broke my heart to know you waited
i had so many things to do
it's true as far as a lot of stuff
you could have had a little better luck
you just called and just hung it up
one of us has had enough
it's true as far as a lot of stuff
you could have had a little better luck
you just called and just hung it up
baby both of us have had enough

hard to love a man
it was hard to love a man like you
goodbye was half the words you knew
while you was waiting for me not to call
i sent my love
in a life built out of only goodbye
is there even room for you to try
while you was waiting for me not to call
i sent my love
it was hard to love a man like you
goodbye is just what you do
in a life built out of only goodbye
is there even room for you
while you was waiting for me not to call
i sent my love

give something else away everyday
born to give it away
i'll take to my grave
no heart at all
i find a new kind every day
i will find in my grave
no new pain
it was easy making my self the same
it was easy making my self less
but to get better
that's the hardest thing
born to give it away
i will take to my grave
no heart at all
it's only the moon that breaks it
not your heart
it's only the moon that breaks it
not your heart
let the night in baby
not the dark

north star blues
where were the rest of my songs tonight
i only remember the north star blues
that simple old tune on the stage each night
marking the time that i lost you
no one should forgive me
i knew what i stood to lose
am i better off now
just forgetting how
i came to earn the north star blues
how can i be the only one
whose life can't live up to the lie
how can i be the only one
whose heart refuses to try
no one should forgive me
i knew what i stood to lose
am i better off now
just forgetting how
i came to have the north star blues
how can i be the only one
whose life can't live up to the lie
how can i be the only one
whose heart refused to try

hammer down
hammer down
heaven bound
i saw the light
on the old grey town
hammer down
heaven bound
sometimes i forget how i've always been sick
and i don't have the will to keep fighting it
hammer down
heaven bound
hammer down
heaven bound
when it's been my ghost on the empty road
i think the stars are just the neon lights
shining through the dance floor
of heaven on a saturday night
i saw the light
hammer down
heaven bound
hammer down
heaven bound
pyramid electric co
when the great pyramids
dragged themselves out to this spot
a sickness sank into the little one's heart
mama said son
that's just the cold
that's just the emptiness
it's being alone
in the dark
you'll get used to it
you'll have friends who won't come home
you'll see their bones
not separate yet from death
but you'll get used to it
you'll get used to it
we all get used to it
see the bloody arrow above us
see the blood that underlines it
dark repetition

red comet dust
the endless blue
shadow inside you
gathered in you
disappeared in you
into the solid earth
into the solid earth
i want to be true
like the solid earth
i want to be true
a red comet's dust
falls in the field
re-marking the trail
now you follow that trail
i want to be true
like the solid earth
the constant old witness
to accept what i see in it
what i think i see 
looking out at me
from the primal dust

division st girl
painted up division street girl
she's a pretty denim queen
bird of paradise eyes
bird of paradise dying eyes
but i could sight read those slangy lips
i could sight right those hips
and anyway out loud she says
hey sucker
are you lonely
well that's alright
you don't have to say anything
i can always tell when
you lost something big
something real big
well we all did
a jukebox in an empty room
conjures up the blues
they got my song on it
want to dance
cause it's just you and me and the gravity
you and me down on division street
and it's like we've landed on the enemy's side
and the other guys all quit
and they left us with nothing when they split
except the cold and the quiet
and the blues to sing about it

honey watch your ass
the smoke tastes like gray lead
it's killing her head
she finally let him have it
here practice yelling at yourself instead
she nearly burned the town again
with the look that she gave him
she covers her heart with her hands and says
a little useless praying never hurts anything
it's like nothing's got a pulse
in this whole damn place
right down to the clocks
nothing's got a pulse
remember darling how quiet it got
leave her alone let her go home
so she don't have to see you
how pathetic you can be
so she won't hate herself to death
know what i mean
she's covering he heart with her hands and says
a little useless praying never hurts anything
that must be her up there
perfume and cigarette smoke in her wild hair
she smells a little like a train
hauling lilacs through the rain
i can't tell that she's crying
i'll pretend again
but she sees them total destruction
as she goes running to them
i'm finally showing her the switch
how i learned to hold it
in my teeth
how she's got to keep
one razor sharp bloody piece
of her old broken heart
how she's got to use that edge to carve
across her new heart
something deep enough to hurt
so it always reminds her
deep enough to last
darlin' honey watch your ass

song of the road
the halos lights
look good with the ringing
fog bells
orion dead in the arc
but you can't tell
lead gray eclipse above
hiss of the snakes
rolling beside us
we are thrown into the shade
i think we'll be okay
the echo of the muffled drums
don't be overwhelmed by that
if you think this is hard work
you've never seen work
feel for your charm
take out your good luck
we're getting close to the edge
do what you know
do a good job
you're getting closer to the end
what do you know
i know the song of the road
the song of the road

spectral alphabet
emptiness and blue
beside the city moon
empty black cat eyes
cat's cradle eyes
keep an eye on you
heavy spanish moss
a hanging veil across the graceland get
the ancestors of the world
think it looks great
their names inscribed by death
in a spectral alphabet
their names look foreign
and they are forgotten by the world again
emptiness and blue
beside the city moon
the empty streets
hardly remember you
the rest of us do
a promise inscribed by death
in a sprectral alphabet
the words look foreign
and they are forgotten by the world again
what it says could that have kept us out of fiery hands 
the farewell transmission
the whole place is dark
every light on this side of the town
suddenly it all went down
now we'll all be brothers of the fossil fire of the sun
now we will all be sisters of the fossil blood of the moon
someone must have set us up
now they'll be working in the cold grey rock in the hot mill steam in the concrete
in the sirens and the silences now all the great set up hearts - all at once start to beat
after tonight if you don't want us to be a secret out of the past
i will resurrect it i'll have a good go at it
i'll streak his blood across my beak and dust my feathers with his ashes
i can feel his ghost breathing down my back
i will try and know whatever i try i will be gone but not forever
the real truth about it is no one gets it right
the real truth about it is we're all supposed to try
there ain't no end to the sands i've been trying to cross
the real truth about it is my kind of life's no better off
if i've got the maps or if i'm lost
the real truth about it is there ain't no end to the desert i'll cross
i've really known that all along
mama here comes midnight with the dead moon in its jaws
must be the big star about to fall
long dark blues
will o the wisp
the big star is falling
through the static and distance
a farewell transmission
listen

i’ve been riding with the ghost
while you was gone you must have done a lot of favors
you've got a whole lot of things i don't think
that you could ever have paid for
while you've been busy crying
about my past mistakes
i've been busy trying to make a change
i made a change
i've been riding with the ghost
i've been doing whatever he told me
i've been looking door to door to see
if there was someone who'd hold me
i never met a single one who didn't see through me
none of them could love me if they thought they might lose me
unless i made a change
see i ain't getting better i am only getting behind
i am standing on a crossroad trying to make up my mind
i'm trying to remember how it got so late
why every night pain comes from a different place
now something's got to change
i put my foot to the floor
to make up for the miles i've been losing
see i'm running out of things
i didn't even know i was using
and while you've been busy
learning how to complain
i've been busy learning
how to make a change
i made it almost again

just be simple
you never hear me talk about one day getting out
why put a new address on the same old loneliness
everybody knows where that is
we built that house of his
and when he's not home
someone else you know always is
if heaven's really coming back
i hope it has a heart attack
when they see how dangerous it is for guys like that
the night has always known when it's time to get going
when it's really been so long that it starts showing
it's always had that ghost who always almost
tells me the secret
how there's really no difference in who he was once
and who he's become
everything you hated me for honey there was so much more
i just didn't get busted
but i'm not looking for an easy way out
this whole life it's been about
try and try and try
and try and try and try
to be simple again

almost was good enough once
it's been hard doing anything
winter stuck around so long
i kept trying anyhow and i'm still trying now
just to keep working just to keep working
i remember when it didn't use to be so hard
this used to be impossible
a new season has to begin
i can feel it leaning in whispering nothing's lonely now
nothing anymore in pain
a tall shadow dressed how secrets always dress
when they want everyone to know that they 're around
leaning in whispering my friend over there
don't know what he's talking about
did you really believe
that everyone makes it out?
almost no one makes it out
i'm going to use that street to hide
from that human doubt
to hide from what was shining
and has finally burned us out
but if no one makes it out
how come you're talking to one right now
for once almost was good enough

the old black hen
old black hen is that you again
singing the bad luck lullaby
come right on in  it's midnight again
time for the bad luck lullaby
you know the one it's the same one you sung
when you wrote down the revelations
now sing it over the cradle of the child who's born next
leave all the truth in so they know what comes next
leave in the true love that they'll never find
show how we're looking for it all of our lives
when i saw the banner hanging over my door
i already knew who the party was for
all of my pain found a partner in that room
and the devil's tail swayed with the tune
make that black record
roll the tapes all night long
make that black record
and we'll all sing along
look down the long street
and see who's that crying
tell them that every day i lived
i was trying to sing the blues
the way i find them

peoria lunchbox blues
gwendolyn i wonder what you'd've called them
i think a name you might choose is nobody's blues
you see when you are just a kid
they think you won't remember what they did
they think you won't rememberbut you did
then you learned how to say everything you love
tries to get away
everything you love finally does
its finally looking good up there our skyline
see how if fits right in there with heaven
the constellations and comiskey's lights
two old friends in the night
who always knew they would if they could
meet one last time in the old neighborhood
hey wait a minute things ain't looking that good
its getting quiet and the light's getting dim
this ain't like no place i've ever been
what kind of trouble am i in?
oh gwen here they come again
it's nobody's blues
here they come again

john henry split my heart
i stood on the  hwy
wysteria magnolia beside the green line track
said don't come back
i found myself standing on the mountain
beneath my full moon heart
john henry split this heart split this full moon heart
swing the heaviest hammer you got
hit this one out of the park
he says boy what you going to do
with your heart in two
if its good enough
but only if its good enough
half i'm going to use
to pay this band
half i'm saving because i'm going to owe them
didn't it rain
no matter how dark the storm gets overhead
they say someone's watching from the calm at the edge
what about us when we're down here in it
we gotta watch our own backs
but if you do see that golden light
that it shines in its fiery eye
go on and catch it while you can
go on and catch it if you can
let it course through you
and let it burn through you
if it's the light of truth
if they think you got it they're going to beat it out of you
with work and debt whatever all else there is
you got to watch your own back
try to see the light of goodness burning down the track
through the blinding rain through the swaying wires
if i see you struggle i will not turn my back
i've seen a good man and a bad man down the same path
i've seen the light of truth keeping out of it and told them to watch their own backs
if i see you struggle and givin all that you got
i see you work all night burning your light to the last of its dim watts
i'm gonna help you how i can if you see me struggle all night
and give me a hand cause i'm in need i'll call you friend indeed
but i'm going to watch my own back
didn't it rain

steve albini's blues
on the bridge out of hammond
see them brake lights burning feel my motor turnin
on the bridge out of hammond
see the big city moon
see how it close comes
watch my wiper blades pound it like a drum
on the bridge out of hammond
think about what's darkening my life
see the light of the afterworld shining on the ruins
it's the light of nowhere else burning to the west
see its sulphery shine
from the bridge out of hammond
see the big city moon 
between the radio towers
between the big diesel rigs
in the midwest's witching hour
i watch the whole town eclipse
from the bridge out of hammond

ring the bell
help does not just walk up to you i could have told you that
i'm not an idiot
i could have told you that
in every serpent's eye watch you go where you go
every serpents double tongue takes a turn with your soul
if you let them ring your bell
they're ringing the bell
why wouldn't i be trying to figure it out
everyone tells you that
everyone tells you not to quit
i can't even see it to fight it
if it looks like i'm not trying i don't care what it looks like
cause i stood at the alter and everything turned white
all i heard was the sound of the world coming down around me
why wouldn't i be trying
why wouldn't i try
cause those double tongues are singing hear the wail of the choir through the fog
the sound of that choir through the fog
they're always close they're always so close always close always so close
if there's a way out it will be step by step through the black
why wouldn't i be trying to figure it out it don't mean i'm not trying if i don't make it back
i know serpents will cross universes to circle around our necks
i know hounds will cross universes to circle around our feet
i know they're close
step by step one's beside me to kill me or to guide me
why wouldn't i be trying to figure which one out

cross the road molina
wolf headed conjurour in the cross roads
green eyes and alien chant brought the lightning down
set my pulse to the short waves pulse
set my pulse to the great lakes pulse
to wreath the moon in a head dress of neon flames
must take concentration from that heavy old bird
blue chicago moon swings like a blade above the midwest's heart
swings like a blade
swing that blade above us
show us how close it can get
show us close you can get
show us how fast we can lose it how bad we're out numbered
set my pulse an electric pulse
set my pulse to the blues
them black sad eyes
if i never see them again tell them goodbye
and i set my pulse to an electric pulse
i set my pulse to the blues
i send my pulse to the vixen's hearts
i concentrate like that heavy old bird

blue factory flame
when i die put my bones in an empty street to remind me of how it used to be
don't write my name on a stone bring a coleman lantern and a radio
cleveland game and two fishing poles and watch with me from the shore
ghostly steel and iron ore ships coming home
where i am paralyzed by the emptiness
clearly iron age beasts you can tell by the rust and the chains
and by the oil that they bleed the crew and crows fly the skulls and bones
they fly the colors of their homes i fly the cross of the blue factory flame
stitched with heavy sulpher thread/threat
they ain't proud colors but they're true colors of my home
where i am paralyzed by the emptiness
every mile for ten thousand miles and every year for a thousand years
every night for a thousand more i hear them calling
they never say to come home
where i am paralyzed by the emptiness

two blue lights
two blue lights
one's the blue light of the late night bus
one's the blue light of the moon over us
one's got the diesel fuel on her breath
one's got the damp taste of the earth on it
two blue lights
there's a dead archer in the tower you can't hear it but you can tell
when the bells ring twelve times in hell the bells ring twelve times in this town as well
two blue lights
lightning risked it all
still no guides
it's not a generous world
it is a separate world
the bad luck taste of the dark
the broad luck of blood on the water
i can see it will be red the choice if it is a choice
it's too hard to tell 
lightning standing drained and like us deeply risked it all
and like us deeply risked it all 

the body burned away
death as it shook you
you gave it a fool's look
you said i am an empty page to you
give me your hand give me you blood
don't misunderstand
i once had all the words
i forgot all the words
held the binding lightning
began to burn away
we began to burn away
held the binding the lightning
began to burn away
the body burns away 

no limits on the words
put no limits on the words
simply to live that is my plan
in a city that breaks us
i will say nothing
i can tell that the shadow likes you still
like the memory my heart keeps remembering
that simply to live that was my plan
and i will say nothing

the ocean's nerves
this place is trouble waiting
the light hangs so weakly on to the quiet
drag myself in a long line
in a long line
in a lonely line
and i jealously want the ocean's deep nerve
i am a red flame hanging low to be close to it
hanging low to be close to you

not just a ghost's heart
after all this work she's still built to sail
the curve of the whole coast her curve's the whole coast
how she could read the map showing only the sea
only empty houses empty houses
are we still able at night to watch
with human heart's at all
how she could read the map showing only the bells
she's still able at night to watch
with a human heart
not just a ghost's heart
trouble will find you
trouble will find you
it's hard work to avoid you
it is the hardest work i know
whatever we are now seem hardly aware
of what we're used to being
of what we planned on being
and i'd trade it all
for you to come home

the moon undoes it all
in the dusk
bloody mane and tail
in the dawn
cold that aches in his belly
the sun that scarred his back
it was doubtful it would end
i came here out of common sense
the future enough behind me
and i stay here out of another sense
with the future enough in front of me
this one walks alone 
the silver wind makes a desperate effort to say
the moon undoes it all
this belongs to no one 
but you

darkness that strong
darkness that oblique darkness that strong
the moon in it's cradle is casual is distinct
from the stars
they are his father upon the land
and i made an estimate of the secret laid plan
and i make an estimate of the secret that they bare
when they are down here
darkness that oblique darkness that strong
and that is my report

keep only one of us free
the space you gave to me
you marked out dividing lines
keep only one of us free
the frame that held me
has rotted away
now we are paired again
back with friction 
and black angel falls in with one of us again
and light is barely breathing its breath between us
between black angel black angel black
we have lost what we had marked
out for ambition
now only one of us are free
only one of us are free

the world at the end of the world
it runs the length of the world
and it gets heavy like woman's secret
and full of sorrow like a sudden thing
the ancestors of shadow the ancestors of smoke
the memory at night
the strength to face the world at the edge of the world

fire on the shore
shut you eyes across the uneven road
the sun shuts his eyes
he is asking everywhere for you
but i keep a wide eye open to the flame
tonight there is a fire
tonight there is a fire on the spanish shore
the fire is not my home it has come to be my home
and if the fire is not my home it has come to mean my home

mighty like love mighty like sorrow
a stray star yielding on her back
as much as she can
it is so hard
a stray star yielding on her back
do not leave me
it is dull hot hours
it is hurting like the winter
stars do spangle the sky here
and the moon is burning between us
and it is so hard
the weight of the distance comes down between us
mighty like love and mighty like sorrow
the black crow
through sparrow black wind
a dead crow calls out to his wing
we were lightning across the whole world
we were lightning
and the guise to black cats we made a cross when our shadows met
and the guise to black cats we made a pact when our shadows passed
through sparrow black wind
a dead crow calls out to its wings
i'm getting weaker i'm getting thin
i hate how obvious i have been
i'm getting weaker
and i look down and see the whole world
and it's fadingrepeat

tigress
it's difficult not to worry about what happens next
certain looks sort out confused looks
and certain looks sport confused looks
and i watched us talking in the mirror
and you put on that look
that says this little star wishes she weren't single
it is the eye that catches me a man protesting his worth
it is the year that catches you putting the shake on your words
you are alert as a tigress at a common table with her fate
you can almost taste it
we'll be gone be morning or be together by then
and i believe every woman has made up her mind to win

nervous bride
the women are dressed up and they are up to no good
you're dressed up for liberation
you flash that fire flag you fly above
the bright hot sails of your eyes
they say vaguely goodbye
there is a long delay in our words
then there are no words
and i lay down tonight as nervous as a bride
she's not nervous but she tries
and it's vaguely goodbye

being in love
being in love means you are completely broken
then put back together the one piece that was yours
is beating in your lovers breast
she says the same thing about hers
however i have gotten here i have plans to be with you
and for the first time it is working
and i am proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn
yeah we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn
what's left after that's all gone i hope to never learn
but if you stick with me you can help me
i'm sure we'll find new things to burn
cause we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn
yeah we are proof that the heart is a risky fuel to burn

lioness
it is for me the eventual truth
of that look of the lioness to her man across the nile
it is that look of the lioness to her man across the nile
wanna feel my heart break if it must break in your jaws
want you to lick my blood off your paws
you can't get her fast enough
i will swim to you
whether you save you me
whether you savage me
want my last look to be the moon in your eyes
want my heart to break if it must break in your jaws
want you to lick my blood off your paws
it is for me the eventual truth
it is that look of the lioness to her man across the nile
and you can't get here fast enough
i will swim to yourepeat

coxcomb red
and i wanted that heat so bad
i could taste the fire on your breath
and i wanted in your storm so bad
i could taste the lightning on your breath
i watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
he grew so pale next to you
the world is so pale next to you
your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
you said every road is a good road
between the next road and your last road
every love is your best love and every love is your last love
and every kiss is a goodbye
i watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
he grew so pale next to you
the world is so pale next to you
your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black

back on top
there ain't nothing beyond hope
i've been thrashed by the hope of your body
i've been thrashed by the hope of your eyes
you looked me square in the eyes
you said don't take but one thing to be your truth
when i'm back on the top again
that is the truth
that is your truth
there ain't nothing beyond truth
i've been thrashed by the truth of your body
i've been thrashed by the truth of your eyes
you looked me square in the eyes
you said don't take but one thing to be your truth
when i'm back on the top again
that is the truth
the dark wrong turn
the moon and the owls reprise the ghost
and i'm even more afraid by its recent move
complete world beside him now
he lays a blue hand across a serious pale sky
and i now belong here
before they think of every endeavor
be it bright or be it subtle light
night and its insides sprawl across
the blue heart risin'
adding only black
to the face of a serious pale sky

ruby eyes in the fog
i have the courage to say i am confused
why you would build all of that up to tolerate
whatever will transpire in that place
and i have the courage to say it is
like separation a disease you should back away
how it lived so long
and i vow well enough to serve them well
though they produce invisible consequence
you can believe the regular way of words
their smallness and their trembling
they are small they are treacherous
when they are smallest they are treacherous
and i look straight through it like a line
and i have the courage to repeat it
but i respect it just enough not to repeat it

at certain hours it all breaks down
sooner or later a bright day comes
and it digs into the cellar of the darkest hearts
that it is more rare than it is true
at certain hours it all breaks down
you have less substance and less solid ground
you no longer suspiscious and you follow around
at certain hours it all breaks down
if you find me again open before you
and if you find me again with my head at the foot of the wall
i am sticking to what i personally saw
there were twelve of them
and they were circling around the image of me
and i was clad only in my faults
and i was in that hour all alone with twelve of them
and i was colorless the night was colorless but it had something
i wish i could find it again
the was made out of
so i left the city in the most subtle way

the wild wind
by the way you are behaving
i should be shaking my head
someone else will have to explain it
took at wind the dust was honest
took it in when the stars surround us
conversation is sloping off
and you know he must make a mistake
at this time they were slippery
and they were surrounded by them
and all they wore was their behavior
their bad behaviorbad behavior
you are looking humiliated
you say that i'm as naked as i am
as naked as a woman
naked as a man
and you must bring us half an hour
of good luck when you can
you must bring the appeal of laughter if you can
you're surrounded by a halo that is sloping offsloping off
you get that curious look clamped to your mouth
wipe it away with the back of your hand
you're back that way hating again
the falling light

the lost messenger
a little frightened of going near
a little distracted i hear
wouldn't you rather come back with me?
you never used to get worried and now i'm worried
it's never ending put it all away
that shit is never ending put it all away
when you aren't around you can never say you were trying to quit
you were trying to quit
that shit is never ending
you're already surrounded
that shit is never ending and you're already surrounded
and i ask and i am worried
you asked so i said i was frightened

one harrowing night
will that look be your only reply
you lower your head in reply
you mimic with your eye the moon
here it is white and full like a pale ghost across the sky
and here it is crescent like a dagger from your heart into mine
here it is just a spark to shine

you are not alone on the road
there is a silent role call that greets us in this bed
tonight it's waiting
still it's waiting for one of us
what about the one with the sharp edged mouth and eyes
the one that looked into me with the irresponsible look
the one that now is saying
i must depend on something
she whispered her future lover's name

why are we stopping in the storm
a resolute moment returns
and that's how close i got to you
it's as red as the target heart
even the sky's been influenced by you
and it ends all that doubt
it's true for any or all of us
there's never a good night to be
everything i've ever loved is here tonight
or the wish that it was here tonight is here tonight
everything that you need for truth is here tonight
or at least the wish for it is here tonight
and i am taken my chance here tonight
on that target heart
it is red as the target's heart
even the sky was influenced by you
see how the self can be made and remade
but the truth can either be made but can't be remade
love can't be made or remade

the far end of the bridge
there's a night that's a good night
for letting your friends down
there's never a good night for being cheap
there ain't never a good night for ripping people off
but there ain't no law against it
there has never been a good night for letting you friends down
there has never been a good night for being cheap
there has never been a good night for ripping people off
but there ain't no law against it
obviously you don't see no law against it
obviously you haven't seen nothing wrong with it
hot black silk
there will be trouble with me
there will be trouble more than these
and i warned you
ten times of these things
there ain't nothin' short of wisdom
in your hot black silk
and there won't be more
than one of me
is the only thing i can ever promise you
and i make enough lovin'
for three of me
there ain't nothin short of wisdom
in your hot black silk

captain badass
departure and worry
still shakes me
resistance failed
and friendship failed
as lovers we did not fail
brown eyes your pulse is getting hotter
brown eyes your pulse is getting quicker
quote captain badass
 i am setting you heart on fire
so when you leave me
i will burn on in your soul
you won't have to think twice
if it's love you will know
we get no second chance in this life
so a hot pulse is alright
so a quick pulse is alright
so a hot kiss is alright
so a long kiss is alright
so a long night is alright
and all night is alright
there ain't no contest
against the final day
we'll rise above us either way
we're either greeted
by life or its reverse
then each day greeted
by fortune or its reverse
will you stand up for your one chance
will you stand up for love
we get no second chance in this life
you won't have to think twice if its love
you will know

love and work
there are gaps between the light
and the dark roads we are on
no gaps between what's right
and the need that we have
somewhere under am
there is the room and
the events in this room
there is the dark
and these events in the dark
there is love and work and lovers work
love and work
and it took all of my strength
to ignore the need to stay
and it took all of my strength
to leave you either way
and we are constellations
in our own way
and there are these
three degrees of merit to us
there is love and work and lovers work
love and work

come back to your man
coaxingly closing to dangerous eyes
they hang their lighted
she feels the effort of h-a-n-d's
she feels the effort of e-y-e's
she feels the effort of l-i-e's
fumble across her
there are demands on spirit and flesh
and i've made the effort to survive them
now come back to your man

love leaves its abuser
you must have heard
that voice loud and plain
through all the thunder i surrounded you in
and i once had cause
and i once had strength
but i have been selfish
to say the least
i owned up to this
though leaving is a curious way
for you to love me
so my life and my whole waiting guilt
i enclose late with my dues to you
love leaves its abuser

champion
she with all her reasons
hardly spoke two words
let what's left of this relation
find its way to swiftest decay
let us rest in the decisions of this hour
champion
there are no claims on you

red head
the broken times
self-confidence must be
it's obviously
selfish to preserve
and selfish to pursue
i guess it's the proper way
to go on to loving
begin with nothing
and so here's the state
that love's left me in
in the estate of the redhead
and what does she mean
she don't need the proof
of my failures
or all the nights when
i earned my failure
and i suppose
i've not been rejected
and i suppose
we've not been a failure
and i suppose that we're proof of it

how to be perfect men
suppose my life has its plan
i choose to have women write my plan
and i have my reasons
they'll write that list
of all that i should be
and perfect men would never be
jealous or desperate
my ghost and i in our grave will lie
and we'll read that plan
on how to be perfect man
if anyone succeeds you
this will be her song to know that
i will get it wrong
be mine
'till you're reminded of something better
be mine
until it comes along
be mine
'till you're reminded of something better
until it comes along

the hangman's water is often sweeter
on these western roads
know the heat of their travelers
that go down go down

my eyes know the blinder is black

it's more than my companion should allow
right now
there's nothing my equal right now

my bones shall rise up muskettes
my feet are at the threshold

the boats they've pawned for stranding
we will drown them like their anchors
my bones shall rise up anchors
my feet are at the threshold
and disaster warms our sails

there are fewer greater losses known
they have their affect they have their ransom
this will survive
you're all i think this thing set troublin'
it will not end without brevity
against the smell of hope through measuring
there are fewer greater former ghosts
we have our affect we have our ranson
this we'll survive

 white sulfur
never forget it was triumph we once proposed
instead you would trade our mission for mission words
our several months alliance divergent invitations
then policies they were very low you see
we'll look of course to it
the ones you know you are building
so then i'd like to see a little low illumination
so i may go around : or :
who knows what
so then i have to be going
okay

close to the citadel she raises her laquered hooves
the long road division for lack of another route
and these then were all too good advantage lost
and i grow suspect as soon as your friendliness rises

but not a second chance
close to the citadel will hasten to affirm
for this congress we have ridden doubly against
and we'll grow suspect
as soon as their friendliness rises
and i alone stand a chance but not a second chance

trouble comes from a passionate word and
you should know
passion comes from a passing word
dark blue they our banners flayed
and burning to the base
submit to draw closer
the glance you'd once given me
an attempt of the old position
they impose their pushing in steep heroics
these fine others
i owe my lifted tho' wounded head
and every side of you to a man
there have been signals
these are now joined by a future
and only say which decayed
not live opposite the failed republic
time will meet and pass you by
you should know
trouble comes from a passionate word

passion comes from a troublesome word
you should know
trouble sounds like a comforting word
you should know
passion comes from a passing word

my blood's courage courses to rendezvous

judas they too would cry
oh oriole in the mile before dawn

right now the world suffers for you

set myself down on the frozen ground at dawn
pointed myself with my back to the sun
and thus were his eyes
his hands spoke misfortune
and these are his words
that brought me through my sickness
if i were my hands
i'd choke out these words
my dying breath
set yourself down on the dewy ground at dawn
and there point yourself with your back to the sun

same blue voice to sound it
how exactly jonesy do you declare we're bound
spend the lives that rise between us
we were once so constant
if you have been to constant
then i was this thing also
perhaps i will join that posture
you have braced around your smile

sailor dogwood gap
how goes it soldier
i'm too young to muster
though i know brown bonnet
who sweats like a soldier
when her boots come riding
on those nights that seem like the devil is riding
my halo for sabers over his shoulder
and he brings to me the rope and saw
one put to hang in put one to save in
and how goes it sailor i'm unwell for sailing
though i know the captain's bride
cause she comes to me and
she's handsome and wild as a hawk
and how goes it sister i do hate be botherin'
though i know you hate the fiends
they come to you and they're bearin' friendship
no lies could more have been
you come to me and
you're handsome you're wild as a hawk

for you greenbrier-lp only
an abuse of mercy is the action of
a survivor only
the stars that glow from port to portland
are not the same to abort their sting
when judgement comes to walk the earth
he will come with heaviest tidings
when he knocks on the door is for you
unless a friend were in deed to labor
his life alongside his greatest hazard
they'red always be room for you

sin and death blue jay
it seems that the older inhabitors never got out of you
the phantom broods were wronged in body
and in a state they will make their soon escape
by building a new inheiritence
it's likely more not to be
than sin and death and vipers to fill our beds
and as for liberty she will work or she will suffer
i am dense with the light of women
and i insist i'm not confused
i will not be going

fortunate man conscript or little beaver
conscript fathers when they were by to see
not inspired by our lack of honesty
only then could i lament their services as fortunate men
who's a fortunate man there's a fortunate man

as well as on the first occasion as well as in the end
only then could i regret my service as a fortunate man
who's a fortunate man
there are no fortunate men

runs for it blue stone
alone or in company the city makes me nervous
you know i'd rather be
with little sorrel or your house
or a little bit further
where i'd be standing with my reassurer
such an engine speaks such gear words
a sight for a civillians prayer
an american on the dorsett shore
runs for it
to risk the pathetic again tonight
such poverty compells us to perfect our pride
run for it
so you can see to go there will be distance
spoken word intro by darcie schoenman
wonder what that could mean
there will be distance
distance meet anxiety
anxiety meet the cold
the thing is still you will be gone and
i'll have to leave the lights on
so you can see to go

the arrogant truth it’s your win again
pilot and a friend to the lord comes aboard
'til silence comes again
and what i'd dare say
if such a journey should pass through me
it might not suit me to obey anything
'til silence comes again
and if that's prudent it's your win again
and let us hope
this lessens its whole appearance like truth
the arrogant truth

goodnight lover
you mistrusted what will bleed
what will not die will not leave
the heart was first in that line
though it was under those conditions
we were free
under those conditions
of pain that would not leave
you were all i ever trusted
you're self made
you made it on hard work and risk
hard work
how will i live on without you
without your customs
of working and thinking action through
these days are obvious to you budgetive
how selflish for time to conclude
what would be the day
for leaving to work it's charm on you
and i can tell by that look
you were thinking the same thing to
if this can't last just what can last
then it's lights out after this kiss
then time can't torment us
this will have to serve
goodnight lover
wherever you are
a widow sang the stars down
i know about how bleak it all can seem
when you look at good or bad
you say this is what i had
and i know it is ambitious but it's still the truth
i have something that's lasting in a man
my heart has survived an order through the ruins
the shadow and it's promise vibrates across the room
you said it's savage but it's my duty
to build something precious than to kill something precious
then the shadow and then the promise clearly lost its nerve
don't leave me now
just say you're practicing for how you would say goodbye
don't leave me now
baby take a look
baby take a look
look at your man
do i look like a man who doesn't understand
you are the one true thing
in a world full of untrue things
if you're down on your luck
i will hold till better times
so baby take that look
look at your man
do i look like a man who doesn't understand
you are the one

just a spark
will that look be your only reply
you lower your head in reply
here it is white and full like a pale ghost across the sky
and here it is crescent like a dagger from your heart into mine
here it is just a spark to shine
the one red star
blue news in the heart
you are the one red sister star
you are the flash across the water
one red sister star
black has marked the distance
black has marked out all the miles
across the world from you
and i'm afraid right down the middle
i am afraid right down the middle
it is black it is yellow
and it is black pittsburgh yellow
your soul the one red star
i am the one red star sister star

whenever i have done a thing in flames
in any house in the world there is background of flames
in any house in the world there is background of storms
and any house in the world a winter spent alone
wherever i have done a thing for love it has ruined me
rebuild the day out of flames
rebuild the day out of the silence of that day
i'm going to choose i will have to choose
whenever i have done a thing in flames
it has saved me
incantation
the sound of our feet against the road
it spreads through the night
and the city's ending
speak to me if we're near the bottom
work it out with me
caution like the moon hangs on the tracks
blood and the lightning hangs on the tracks and
it spreads through the night
to where the city's ending
an absent star
worked it out with me
spreads through the night
blue chicago moon
out of the ruins
blood grown heavy from his past
his wings stripped by thunder
but those storms keep coming back
singing birds in sickness
sing the same blues songs
when they fell out of the emptiness
they must have brought along
space's loneliness
gotten so good at hiding it
even he does not admit it
that glittering flash in his eyes
makes it look like he might be alright
if the blues are you hunter
then you will come face to face
with that darkness and desolation
and the endless depression
but you are not helpless
and you are not helpless
try to beat it
and live through space's loneliness
you are not helpless
i'll help you to try to beat it
hold on magnolia
hold on magnolia to that great highway moon
no one has to be that strong
but if you're stubborn like me
i know what you're trying to be
hold on magnolia i hear that station bell ring
you might be holding the last light i see
before the dark finally gets a hold of me
hold on magnolia i know what a true friend you've been
in my life i have had my doubts
but tonight i think i've worked it out with all of them
hold on magnolia to the thunder and the rain
to the lightning that has just signed my name to the bottom line
hold on magnolia i hear that lonesome whistle whine
hold on magnolia
i think its almost time
long desert train
yu used to love a lot of things
you used to love talking
this you never told me about
if it's what your eyes were saying
i already figured it out
i could just tell it was bad
i couldn't tell how bad
you never took off your shades
and you stayed like that for days
i guess your pain never weakened
your cool blood started burning
scorching most of us in the flames
but there are things you can't change
there are things you can't change
you called that the curse of a human's life
that you couldn't change
said you'd never be old enough
or young enough
tall enough
or thin enough
or smart enough
or brave enough
rich enough
pretty enough
strong enough
good enough
well you were to us
you wanted silence by itself
just the word
you wanted peace by itself
just to learn
there were things you couldn't change
you got the dull pounding rain
you got the last car in the long desert train
you almost made it
you almost made it again 
i can not have seen the light
again you're swinging low
and you hit me below the belt
alright since it's a fair fight
i'd say it's the best that i have felt
in a long long time
every now and then it happens again
i can't remember what comes first
is it the hurt
or knowing that it hurts
is it the hurt
or knowing that it hurts
ever since i turned my life around
it still happens time to time
don't know what pain was yours
or what pain was mine
what pain was yours
and what pain was mine
will i have to be alright all of the time
no one has to be alright all of the time
do i have to be alright all of the time
i thought i saw the light
i saw the light
