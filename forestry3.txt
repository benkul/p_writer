In the little volume called The Famous Men of Rome you have read
about the great empire which the Romans established Now we come to
a time when the power of Rome was broken and tribes of barbarians
who lived north of the Danube and the Rhine took possession of
lands that had been part of the Roman Empire These tribes were the
Goths Vandals Huns Franks and Anglo-Saxons From them have come
the greatest nations of modern times All except the Huns belonged
to the same race and are known as Teutons They were war-like
savage and cruel They spoke the same language though in different
dialects and worshiped the same gods Like the old Greeks and
Romans they had many gods

Woden who was also called Odin was the greatest of all His name
means mighty warrior and he was king of all the gods He rode
through the air mounted on Sleip'nir an eight-footed horse fleeter
than the eagle When the tempest roared the Teutons said it was
the snorting of Sleipnir When their ships came safely into port
they said it was Woden's breath that had filled their sails and
wafted their vessels over the blue waters

Illustration THOR THROWING HIS HAMMER

Thor a son of Woden ranked next to him among the gods He rode
through the air in a chariot drawn by goats The Germans called
him Donar and Thunar words which are like our word thunder From
this we can see that he was the thunder god In his hand he carried
a wonderful hammer which always came back to his hand when he threw
it Its head was so bright that as it flew through the air it made
the lightning When it struck the vast ice mountains they reeled
and splintered into fragments and thus Thor's hammer made thunder

Another great god of our ancestors was Tiew He was a son of Woden
and was the god of battle He was armed with a sword which flashed
like lightning when he brandished it A savage chief named Attila
routed the armies of the Romans and so terrified all the world
that he was called The Scourge of God His people believed that
he gained his victories because he had the sword of Tiew which
a herdsman chanced to find where the god had allowed it to fall
The Teutons prayed to Tiew when they went into battle

Frija freeya was the wife of Woden and the queen of the gods
She ruled the bright clouds that gleam in the summer sky and caused
them to pour their showers on meadow and forest and mountain

Four of the days of the week are named after these gods Tuesday
means the day of Tiew Wednesday the day of Woden Thursday the
day of Thor and Friday the day of Frija

Frija's son was Bald'ur who was the favorite of all the gods
Only Lo'ki the spirit of evil hated him Baldur's face was as
bright as sunshine His hair gleamed like burnished gold Wherever
he went night was turned into day

One morning when he looked toward earth from his father Woden's
palace black clouds covered the sky but he saw a splendid rainbow
reaching down from the clouds to the earth Baldur walked upon
this rainbow from the home of the gods to the dwellings of men
The rainbow was a bridge upon which the gods used to come to earth

When Baldur stepped from the rainbow-bridge to the earth he saw
a king's daughter so beautiful that he fell in love with her

But an earthly prince had also fallen in love with her So he and
Baldur fought for her hand Baldur was a god and hence was very
much stronger than the prince But some of Baldur's magic food
was given to the prince and it made him as strong as Baldur

Frija heard about this and feared that Baldur was doomed to be
killed So she went to every beast on the land and every fish of
the sea and every bird of the air and to every tree of the wood
and every plant of the field and made each promise not to hurt
Baldur

But she forgot the mistletoe So Loki who always tried to do mischief
made an arrow of mistletoe and gave it to the prince who shot and
killed Baldur with it

Then all the gods wept the summer breeze wailed the leaves fell
from the sorrowing trees the flowers faded and died from grief and
the earth grew stiff and cold Bruin the bear and his neighbors
the hedgehogs and squirrels crept into holes and refused to eat
for weeks and weeks

The pleasure of all living things in Baldur's presence means the
happiness that the sunlight brings The sorrow of all living things
at his death means the gloom of northern countries when winter
comes

The Val-kyr'ies were beautiful female warriors They had some of
Woden's own strength and were armed with helmet and shield and
spear Like Woden they rode unseen through the air and their horses
were almost as swift as Sleipnir himself They swiftly carried
Woden's favorite warriors to Valhalla the hall of the slain The
walls of Valhalla were hung with shields its ceiling glittered
with polished spearheads From its five hundred and forty gates
each wide enough for eight hundred men abreast to march through
the warriors rushed every morning to fight a battle that lasted
till nightfall and began again at the break of each day When the
heroes returned to Valhalla the Valkyries served them with goblets
of mead such as Woden drank himself

The Teutons believed that before there were any gods or any world
there was a great empty space where the world now is It was called
by the curious name Gin'nungagap which means a yawning abyss

Illustration ONE OF THE VALKYRIES BEARING A HERO TO VALHALLA

To the north of Ginnungagap it was bitterly cold Nothing was there
but fields of snow and mountains of ice To the south of Ginnungagap
was a region where frost and snow were never seen It was always
bright and was the home of light and heat The sunshine from the
South melted the ice mountains of the North so that they toppled
over and fell into Ginnungagap There they were changed into a
frost giant whose name was Ymir e'mir He had three sons They
and their father were so strong that the gods were afraid of them

So Woden and his brothers killed Ymir They broke his body in pieces
and made the world of them His bones and teeth became mountains
and rocks his hair became leaves for trees and plants out of
his skull was made the sky

But Ymir was colder than ice and the earth that was made of his
body was so cold that nothing could live or grow upon it So the
gods took sparks from the home of light and set them in the sky
Two big ones were the sun and moon and the little ones were the
stars Then the earth became warm Trees grew and flowers bloomed
so that the world was a beautiful home for men

Of all the trees the most wonderful was a great ash tree sometimes
called the world tree Its branches covered the earth and reached
beyond the sky till they almost touched the stars Its roots ran
in three directions to heaven to the frost giantshome and to
the under-world beneath the earth

Near the roots in the dark under-world sat the Norns or fates
Each held a bowl with which she dipped water out of a sacred spring
and poured it upon the roots of the ash tree This was the reason
why this wonderful tree was always growing and why it grew as
high as the sky

When Woden killed Ymir he tried to kill all Ymir's children too
but one escaped and ever after he and his family the frost giants
tried to do mischief and fought against gods and men

According to the belief of the Teutons these wicked giants will
some day destroy the beautiful world Even the gods themselves
will be killed in a dreadful battle with them First of all will
come three terrible winters without any spring or summer The sun
and moon will cease to shine and the bright stars will fall from the
sky The earth will be shaken as when there is a great earthquake
the waves of the sea will roar and the highest mountains will totter
and fall The trees will be torn up by the roots and even the
world tree will tremble from its roots to its topmost boughs
At last the quivering earth will sink beneath the waters of the
sea

Then Loki the spirit of evil will break loose from the fetters
with which the gods have bound him The frost giants will join him
They will try to make a secret attack on the gods But Heimdall the
sentry of heaven will be on guard at the end of the rainbow-bridge
He needs no more sleep than a bird and can see for a hundred miles
either by day or night He only can sound the horn whose blast
can be heard through heaven and earth and the under-world Loki
and his army will be seen by him His loud alarm will sound and
bring the gods together They will rush to meet the giants Woden
will wield his spear Tiew his glittering sword Thor his terrible
hammer These will all be in vain The gods must die But so must
the giants and Loki

And then a new earth will rise from the sea The leaves of its
forests will never fall its fields will yield harvests unsown
And in a hall far brighter than Woden's Valhalla the brave and
good will be gathered forever




THE NIBELUNGS

I

The time came when the people of Western Europe learned to believe
in one God and were converted to Christianity but the old stories
about the gods and Valkyries and giants and heroes who were half
gods and half men were not forgotten

These stories were repeated from father to son for generations
and in the twelfth century a poet whose name we do not know wrote
them in verse He called his poem the Nï'bel-ung'en-lied song
of the Nibelungs It is the great national poem of the Germans
The legends told in it are the basis of Wagner's operas

Nibelungs was the name given to some northern dwarfs whose king
had once possessed a great treasure of gold and precious stones but
had lost it Whoever got possession of this treasure was followed
by a curse The Nibelungenlied tells the adventures of those who
possessed the treasure

II

In the grand old city of Worms in Burgundy there lived long ago
the princess Kriemhilda Her eldest brother Gunther was king of
Burgundy

And in the far-away Netherlands where the Rhine pours its waters
into the sea dwelt a prince named Siegfried son of Siegmund
the king

Ere long Sir Siegfried heard of the beauty of fair Kriemhilda
He said to his father Give me twelve knights and I will ride to
King Gunther's land I must win the heart of Kriemhilda

After seven daysjourney the prince and his company drew near
to the gates of Worms All wondered who the strangers were and
whence they came Hagen Kriemhilda's uncle guessed He said
I never have seen the famed hero of Netherlands yet I am sure
that yonder knight is none but Sir Siegfried

And who asked the wondering people may Siegfried be

Siegfried answered Sir Hagen is a truly wonderful knight
Once when riding all alone he came to a mountain where lay the
treasure of the king of the Nibelungs The king's two sons had
brought it out from the cave in which it had been hidden to divide
it between them But they did not agree about the division So
when Seigfied drew near both princes saidDivide for us Sir
Siegfried our father's hoardThere were so many jewels that
one hundred wagons could not carry them and of ruddy gold there
was even more Seigfied made the fairest division he could and as
a reward the princes gave him their father's sword called Balmung
But although Siegfried had done his best to satisfy them with his
division they soon fell to quarreling and fighting and when he
tried to separate them they made an attack on him To save his
own life he slew them both Alberich a mountain dwarf who had
long been guardian of the Nibelung hoard rushed to avenge his
masters but Siegfried vanquished him and took from him his cap of
darkness which made its wearer invisible and gave him the strength
of twelve men The hero then ordered Alberich to place the treasure
again in the mountain cave and guard it for him

Hagen then told another story of Siegfried

Once he slew a fierce dragon and bathed himself in its blood
and this turned the hero's skin to horn so that no sword or spear
can wound him

When Hagen had told these tales he advised King Gunther and the
people of Burgundy to receive Siegfried with all honor

Illustration SIEGFRIED SLAYS THE DRAGON

So as the fashion was in those times games were held in the courtyard
of the palace in honor of Siegfried and Kriemhilda watched the
sport from her window

For a full year Siegfried stayed at the court of King Gunther
but never in all that time told why he had come and never once saw
Kriemhilda

At the end of the year sudden tidings came that the Saxons and
Danes as was their habit were pillaging the lands of Burgundy
At the head of a thousand Burgundian knights Siegfried conquered
both Saxons and Danes The king of the Danes was taken prisoner
and the Saxon king surrendered

The victorious warriors returned to Worms and the air was filled
with glad shouts of welcome King Gunther asked Kriemhilda to welcome
Siegfried and offer him the thanks of all the land of Burgundy

Siegfried stood before her and she said Welcome Sir Siegfried
welcome we thank you one and all He bent before her and she
kissed him

III

Far over the sea from sunny Burgundy lived Brunhilda queen of
Iceland Fair was she of face and strong beyond compare If a knight
would woo and win her he must surpass her in three contests leaping
hurling the spear and pitching the stone If he failed in even
one he must forfeit his life

King Gunther resolved to wed this strange princess and Siegfried
promised to help him But said Siegfried if we succeed I must
have as my wife thy sister Kriemhilda To this Gunther agreed
and the voyage to Iceland began

When Gunther and his companions neared Brunhilda's palace the gates
were opened and the strangers were welcomed

Siegfried thanked the queen for her kindness and told how Gunther
had come to Iceland in hope of winning her hand

If in three contests he gain the mastery she said I will become
his wife If not both he and you who are with him must lose your
lives

Brunhilda prepared for the contests Her shield was so thick and
heavy that four strong men were needed to bear it Three could
scarcely carry her spear and the stone that she hurled could just
be lifted by twelve

Siegfried now helped Gunther in a wonderful way He put on his
cap of darkness so that no one could see him Then he stood by
Gunther's side and did the fighting Brunhilda threw her spear
against the kings bright shield and sparks flew from the steel
But the unseen knight dealt Brunhilda such blows that she confessed
herself conquered

In the second and third contests she fared no better and so she
had to become King Gunther's bride But she said that before she
would leave Iceland she must tell all her kinsmen Daily her kinsfolk
came riding to the castle and soon an army had assembled

Then Gunther and his friends feared unfair play So Siegfried put
on his cap of darkness stepped into a boat and went to the Nibelung
land where Alberich the dwarf was guarding the wonderful Nibelung
treasure

Bring me here he cried to the dwarf a thousand Nibelung knights
At the call of the dwarf the warriors gathered around Sir Siegfried
Then they sailed with him to Brunhilda's isle and the queen and her
kinsmen fearing such warriors welcomed them instead of fighting
Soon after their arrival King Gunther and his men Siegfried and his
Nibelungs and Queen Brunhilda with two thousand of her kinsmen
set sail for King Gunther's land

As soon as they reached Worms the marriage of Gunther and Brunhilda
took place Siegfried and Kriemhilda also were married and after
their marriage went to Siegfried's Netherlands castle There they
lived more happily than I can tell

IV

Now comes the sad part of the Nibelung tale

Brunhilda and Gunther invited Siegfried and Kriemhilda to visit them
at Worms During the visit the two queens quarreled and Brunhilda
made Gunther angry with Siegfried Hagen too began to hate Siegfried
and wished to kill him

But Siegfried could not be wounded except in one spot on which
a falling leaf had rested when he bathed himself in the dragon's
blood Only Kriemhilda knew where this spot was Hagen told her to
sew a little silk cross upon Siegfried's dress to mark the spot
so that he might defend Siegfried in a fight

No battle was fought but Siegfried went hunting with Gunther and
Hagen one day and they challenged him to race with them He easily
won but after running he was hot and thirsty and knelt to drink
at a spring Then Hagen seized a spear and plunged it through the
cross into the hero's body Thus the treasure of the Nibelungs
brought disaster to Siegfried

Gunther and Hagen told Kriemhilda that robbers in the wood had slain
her husband but she could not be deceived

Illustration THE BODY OF SIEGFRIED IS CARRIED TO WORMS

Kriemhilda determined to take vengeance on the murderers of Siegfried
and so she would not leave Worms There too stayed one thousand
knights who had followed Siegfried from the Nibelung land

Soon after Siegfried's death Kriemhilda begged her younger brother
to bring the Nibelung treasure from the mountain cave to Worms

When it arrived Kriemhilda gave gold and jewels to rich and poor
in Burgundy and Hagen feared that soon she would win the love of
all the people and turn them against him So one day he took
the treasure and hid it in the Rhine He hoped some day to enjoy
it himself

As Hagen now possessed the Nibelung treasure the name Nibelungs
was given to him and his companions

V

Etzel or as we call him Attila king of the Huns heard of the
beauty of Kriemhilda and sent one of his knights to ask the queen
to become his wife

At first she refused However when she remembered that Etzel carried
the sword of Tiew she changed her mind because if she became
his wife she might persuade him to take vengeance upon Gunther
and Hagen

And so it came to pass

Shortly after their marriage Etzel and Kriemhilda invited Gunther
and all his court to a grand midsummer festival in the land of
the Huns

Hagen was afraid to go for he felt sure that Kriemhilda had not
forgiven the murder of Siegfried However it was decided that
the invitation should be accepted but that ten thousand knights
should go with Gunther as a body-guard

Shortly after Gunther and his followers arrived at Attila's court
a banquet was prepared Nine thousand Burgundians were seated at
the board when Attila's brother came into the banquet hall with a
thousand well-armed knights A quarrel arose and a fight followed

Thousands of the Burgundians were slain The struggle continued
for days At last of all the knights of Burgundy Gunther and
Hagen alone were left alive Then one of Kriemhilda's friends fought
with them and overpowered both He bound them and delivered them
to Kriemhilda

The queen ordered one of her knights to cut off Gunther's head and
she herself cut off the head of Hagen with Balmung Siegfried's
wonderful sword A friend of Hagen then avenged his death by killing
Kriemhilda herself

Of all the Nibelungs who entered the land of the Huns one only ever
returned to Burgundy


FAMOUS MEN OF THE MIDDLE AGES

                            

ALARIC THE VISIGOTH

KING FROM 394-410 AD

I

Long before the beginning of the period known as the Middle Ages
a tribe of barbarians called the Goths lived north of the River
Danube in the country which is now known as Roumania It was then a
part of the great Roman Empire which at that time had two capitals
Constantinople the new city of Constantine and Rome The Goths
had come from the shores of the Baltic Sea and settled on this
Roman territory and the Romans had not driven them back

During the reign of the Roman Emperor Va'lens some of the Goths
joined a conspiracy against him Valens punished them for this
by crossing the Danube and laying waste their country At last
the Goths had to beg for mercy The Gothic chief was afraid to
set foot on Roman soil so he and Valens met on their boats in the
middle of the Danube and made a treaty of peace

Illustration THE MEETING BETWEEN VALENS AND THE GOTHIC CHIEF ON
THE DANUBE

For a long time the Goths were at war with another tribe of barbarians
called Huns Sometimes the Huns defeated the Goths and drove them
to their camps in the mountains Sometimes the Goths came down
to the plains again and defeated the Huns

At last the Goths grew tired of such constant fighting and thought
they would look for new settlements They sent some of their leading
men to the Emperor Valens to ask permission to settle in some country
belonging to Rome The messengers said to the emperor

If you will allow us to make homes in the country south of the
Danube we will be friends of Rome and fight for her when she needs
our help

The emperor at once granted this request He said to the Gothic
chiefs

Rome always needs good soldiers Your people may cross the Danube
and settle on our land As long as you remain true to Rome we will
protect you against your enemies

These Goths were known as Visigoths or Western Goths Other tribes
of Goths who had settled in southern Russia were called Ostrogoths
or Eastern Goths

After getting permission from the Emperor Valens a large number
of the Visigoths crossed the Danube with their families and their
cattle and settled in the country now called Bulgaria

In course of time they became a very powerful nation and in the
year 394 they chose as their king one of the chiefs named Al'a-ric
He was a brave man and a great soldier Even when a child he took
delight in war and at the age of sixteen he fought as bravely
as the older soldiers

One night not long after he became king Alaric had a very strange
dream He thought he was driving in a golden chariot through the
streets of Rome amid the shouts of the people who hailed him as
emperor This dream made a deep impression on his mind He was
always thinking of it and at last he began to have the idea that
he could make the dream come true

To be master of the Roman Empire he said to himself that is
indeed worth trying for and why should I not try With my brave
soldiers I can conquer Rome and I shall make the attempt

So Alaric called his chiefs together and told them what he had made
up his mind to do

The chiefs gave a cry of delight for they approved of the king's
proposal In those days fighting was almost the only business of
chiefs and they were always glad to be at war especially when
there was hope of getting rich spoils And so the Visigoth chiefs
rejoiced at the idea of war against Rome for they knew that if
they were victorious they would have the wealth of the richest
city of the world to divide among themselves

Illustration ALARIC AT ATHENS

Soon they got ready a great army With Alaric in command they
marched through Thrace and Macedonia and before long reached Athens
There were now no great warriors in Athens and the city surrendered
to Alaric The Goths plundered the homes and temples of the Athenians
and then marched to the state of Elis in the southwestern part
of Greece Here a famous Roman general named Stil'i-cho besieged
them in their camp Alaric managed to force his way through the
lines of the Romans and escaped He marched to Epirus This was
a province of Greece that lay on the east side of the Ionian Sea
Arcadius the Emperor of the East now made Alaric governor of this
district and a large region lying near it The whole territory
was called Eastern Illyricum and formed part of the Eastern Empire

II

Alaric now set out to make an attack on Rome the capital of the
Western Empire As soon as Honorius Emperor of the West learned
that Alaric was approaching he fled to a strong fortress among
the mountains of North Italy His great general Stilicho came to
his rescue and defeated Alaric near Verona But even after this
Honorius was so afraid of Alaric that he made him governor of a
part of his empire called Western Illyricum and gave him a large
yearly income

Honorius however did not keep certain of his promises to Alaric
who consequently in the year 408 marched to Rome and besieged
it The cowardly emperor fled to Ravenna leaving his generals to
make terms with Alaric It was agreed that Alaric should withdraw
from Rome upon the payment of 5000 pounds of gold and 30000 pounds
of silver

When Honorius read the treaty he refused to sign it Alaric then
demanded that the city be surrendered to him and the people terrified
opened their gates and even agreed that Alaric should appoint another
emperor in place of Honorius

This new emperor however ruled so badly that Alaric thought it
best to restore Honorius Then Honorius when just about to be
treated so honorably allowed a barbarian chief who was an ally
of his to make an attack upon Alaric The attack was unsuccessful
and Alaric immediately laid siege to Rome for the third time The
city was taken and Alaric's dream came true In a grand procession
he rode at the head of his army through the streets of the great
capital

Then began the work of destruction The Goths ran in crowds through
the city wrecked private houses and public buildings and seized
everything of value they could find Alaric gave orders that no
injury should be done to the Christian churches but other splendid
buildings of the great city were stripped of the beautiful and
costly articles that they contained and all the gold and silver
was carried away from the public treasury

Illustration THE BURIAL OF ALARIC IN THE BED OF THE RIVER BUSENTO
AT MIDNIGHT

In the midst of the pillage Alaric dressed himself in splendid
robes and sat upon the throne of the emperor with a golden crown
upon his head

While Alaric was sitting on the throne thousands of Romans were
compelled to kneel down on the ground before him and shout out his
name as conqueror and emperor Then the theaters and circuses were
opened and Roman athletes and gladiators had to give performances
for the amusement of the conquerors After six days of pillage and
pleasure Alaric and his army marched through the gates carrying
with them the riches of Rome

Alaric died on his way to Sicily which he had thought to conquer
also He felt his death coming and ordered his men to bury him in
the bed of the river Busento and to put into his grave the richest
treasures that he had taken from Rome

This order was carried out A large number of Roman slaves were
set to work to dig a channel and turn the water of the Busento
into it They made the grave in the bed of the river put Alaric's
body into and closed it up Then the river was turned back to its
old channel As soon as the grave was covered up and the water
flowed over it the slaves who had done the work were put to death
by the Visigoth chiefs




ATTILA THE HUN

KING FROM 434-453 AD

I

The fierce and warlike tribe called the Huns who had driven the
Goths to seek new homes came from Asia into Southeastern Europe
and took possession of a large territory lying north of the River
Danube

During the first half of the fifth century the Huns had a famous
king named At'ti-la He was only twenty-one years old when he became
their king But although he was young he was very brave and ambitious
and he wanted to be a great and powerful king

Not far from Attila's palace there was a great rocky cave in the
mountains In this cave lived a strange man called the Hermit of
the Rocks No one knew his real name or from what country he
had come He was very old with wrinkled face and long gray hair
and beard

Many persons believed that he was a fortune-teller so people often
went to him to inquire what was to happen to them One day shortly
after he became king Attila went to the cave to get his fortune
told

Wise man said he look into the future and tell me what is before
me in the path of life

The hermit thought for a few moments and then said O King I
see you a famous conqueror the master of many nations I see you
going from country to country defeating armies and destroying
cities until men call you theFear of the WorldYou heap up
vast riches but just after you have married the woman you love
grim death strikes you down

With a cry of horror Attila fled from the cave For a time he thought
of giving up his idea of becoming a great man But he was young
and full of spirit and very soon he remembered only what had been
said to him about his becoming a great and famous conqueror and
began to prepare for war He gathered together the best men from
the various tribes of his people and trained them into a great
army of good soldiers

II

About this time one of the king's shepherds while taking care
of cattle in the fields noticed blood dripping from the foot of
one of the oxen The shepherd followed the streak of blood through
the grass and at last found the sharp point of a sword sticking
out of the earth He dug out the weapon carried it to the palace
and gave it to King Attila The king declared it was the sword of
Tiew the god of war He then strapped it to his side and said
he would always wear it

Illustration A HUNNIC INVASION

I shall never be defeated in battle he cried as long as I fight
with the sword of Tiew

As soon as his army was ready he marched with it into countries
which belonged to Rome He defeated the Romans in several great
battles and captured many of their cities The Roman Emperor
Theodosius had to ask for terms of peace Attila agreed that
there should be peace but soon afterwards he found out that
Theodosius had formed a plot to murder him He was so enraged at
this that he again began war He plundered and burned cities
wherever he went and at last the emperor had to give him a
large sum of money and a portion of country south of the Danube

This made peace but the peace did not last long In a few years
Attila appeared at the head of an army of 700000 men With this
great force he marched across Germany and into Gaul He rode on a
beautiful black horse and carried at his side the sword of Tiew
He attacked and destroyed towns and killed the inhabitants without
mercy The people had such dread of him that he was called the
Scourge of God and the Fear of the World

III

Attila and his terrible Huns marched through Gaul until they came to
the city of Orleans Here the people bravely resisted the invaders
They shut their gates and defended themselves in every way they
could In those times all towns of any great size were surrounded by
strong walls There was war constantly going on nearly everywhere
and there were a great many fierce tribes and chiefs who lived by
robbing their neighbors So the towns and castles in which there
was much money or other valuable property were not safe without
high and strong walls

Attila tried to take Orleans but soon after he began to attack
the walls he saw a great army at a distance coming towards the
city He quickly gathered his forces together marched to the
neighboring plain of Champagne and halted at the place where the
city of Châlons shah-lonnow stands

The army which Attila saw was an army of 300000 Romans and Visigoths
It was led by a Roman general name A-ë'ti-us and the Visigoth king
The-od'o-ric The Visigoths after the death of Alaric had settled
in parts of Gaul and their king had now agreed to join the Romans
against the common enemy the terrible Huns So the great army
of the Romans and Visigoths marched up and attacked the Huns at
Châlons It was a fierce battle Both sides fought with the greatest
bravery At first the Huns seemed to be winning They drove back
the Romans and Visigoths from the field and in the fight Theodoric
was killed

Illustration ATTILA AND HIS TERRIBLE HUNS

Aetius now began to fear that he would be beaten but just at that
moment Thor'is-mond the son of Theodoric made another charge
against the Huns He had taken command of the Visigoths when his
father was killed and now he led them on to fight They were all
eager to have revenge for the death of their king so they fought
like lions and swept across the plain with great fury The Huns
were soon beaten on every side and Attila himself fled to his
camp It was the first time he had ever been defeated Thorismond
the conqueror was lifted upon his shield on the battle-field and
hailed as king of the Visigoths

When Attila reached his camp he had all his baggage and wagons
gathered in a great heap He intended to set fire to it and jump
into the flames if the Romans should come there to attack him

Here I will perish in the flames he cried rather than surrender
to my enemies

But the Romans did not come to attack him and in a few days he
marched back to his own country

Very soon however he was again on the war path This time he
invaded Italy He attacked and plundered the town of Aq'ui-le'i-a
and the terrified inhabitants fled for their lives to the hills
and mountains Some of them took refuge in the islands and marshes
of the Adriatic Sea Here they founded Venice

Illustration THORISMOND LIFTED UPON THE SHIELD

The people of Rome and the Emperor Valentinian were greatly alarmed
at the approach of the dreaded Attila He was now near the city
and they had no army strong enough to send against him Rome would
have been again destroyed if it had not been for Pope Leo I who
went to the camp of Attila and persuaded him not to attack the
city It is said that the barbarian king was awed by the majestic
aspect and priestly robes of Leo It is also told that the apostles
Peter and Paul appeared to Attila in his camp and threatened him
with death if he should attack Rome He did not go away however
without getting a large sum of money as ransom

Illustration ST LEO HALTING ATTILA AT THE GATES OF ROME

IV

Shortly after leaving Italy Attila suddenly died Only the day
before his death he had married a beautiful woman whom he loved
very much

The Huns mourned their king in a barbarous way They shaved their
heads and cut themselves on their faces with knives so that their
blood instead of their tears flowed for the loss of their great
leader They enclosed his body in three coffins one of gold one
of silver and one of iron and they buried him at night in a
secret spot in the mountains When the funeral was over they killed
the slaves who had dug the grave as the Visigoths had done after
the burial of Alaric

After the death of Attila we hear little more of the Huns




GENSERIC THE VANDAL

KING FROM 427-477 AD

I

The Vandals were another wild and fierce tribe that came from the
shores of the Baltic and invaded central and southern Europe in
the later times of the Roman Empire

In the fifth century some of these people occupied a region in
the south of Spain One of their most celebrated kings was name
Gen'ser-ic He became king in 427 when he was but twenty-one years
of age He was lame in one leg and looked as if he were a very
ordinary person

Like most of the Vandals he was a cruel and cunning man but he
had great ability in many ways He fought in battles even when
a boy and was known far and wide for his bravery and skill as a
leader

About the time that Genseric became king the governor of the Roman
province in the north of Africa on the Mediterranean coast was
a man called Count Boniface This Count Boniface had been a good
and loyal officer of Rome but a plot was formed against him by
Aëtius the general who had fought Attila at Châlons The Roman
emperor at the time of the plot was Valentinian III He was then
too young to act as ruler so the affairs of government were managed
by his mother Placid'i-a

Aëtius advised Placidia to dismiss Boniface and call him home from
Africa He said the count was a traitor and that he was going
to make war against Rome At the same time he wrote secretly to
Count Boniface and told him that if he came to Rome the empress
would put him to death

Boniface believed this story and he refused to return to Rome
He also sent a letter to Genseric inviting him to come to Africa
with an army

Genseric was greatly delighted to receive the invitation from Boniface
He had long wanted to attack Rome and take from her some of the rich
countries she had conquered and now a good opportunity offered
So he got ready a great army of his brave Vandals and they sailed
across the Strait of Gibraltar to Africa

They soon gained possession of that part of the African coast on
which they had landed and marched into other parts of the coast
and captured towns and cities By this time Boniface had learned
all about the wicked plot of Aëtius He now regretted having invited
the Vandals to Africa and tried to induce them to return to Spain
but Genseric sternly refused

Never he said shall I go back to Spain until I am master of
Africa

Then cried Boniface I will drive you back

Soon afterwards there was a battle between the Romans and Vandals
and the Romans were defeated They were also defeated in several
other battles At last they had to flee for safety to two or three
towns which the Vandals had not yet taken One of these towns was
Hippo

Genseric captured this town after a siege of thirteen months Then
he burned the churches and other buildings and laid waste the
neighboring country This was what the Vandals did whenever they
took a town and so the word vandal came to mean a person who
needlessly or wantonly destroys valuable property

A great many of the natives of Africa joined the army of Genseric
They had for a long time been ill-treated by the Romans and were
glad to see them defeated Genseric continued his work of conquest
until he took the city of Carthage which he made the capital of
his new kingdom in Africa

But he was not content with conquering merely on land He built
great fleets and sailed over the Mediterranean capturing trading
vessels For many years he plundered towns along the coasts so
that the name of Genseric became a terror to the people of all
the countries bordering the Mediterranean

II

One day a Roman ship came to Carthage with a messenger from the
Empress Eudoxia to Genseric Eudoxia was the widow of Valentinian
III After ruling several years Valentinian had just been murdered
by a Roman noble named Maximus who had at once made himself emperor

When the messenger entered the room where Genseric was he said

Great king I bring you a message from the Empress Eudoxia She
begs your help She and her two beautiful daughters are in danger
in Rome She wishes you to protect them against Maximus She invites
you to come with an army to Rome and take the city She and her
friends will help you as much as they can

With a cry of joy Genseric sprang to his feet and exclaimed

Tell the empress that I accept her invitation I shall set out
for Rome immediately I shall set out for Rome immediately I shall
protect Eudoxia and her friends

Genseric then got ready a fleet and a great army and sailed across
the Mediterranean to the mouth of the Tiber When the Emperor Maximus
heard that the Vandals were coming he prepared to flee from the
city and he advised the Senate to do the same The people were
so angry at this that they put him to death and threw his body
into the river

Three days later Genseric and his army were at the gates of Rome
There was no one to oppose them and they marched in and took possession
of the city It was only forty-five years since Alaric had been there
and carried off all the valuable things he could find But since
then Rome had become again grand and wealthy so there was plenty
for Genseric and his Vandals to carry away They spent fourteen days
in the work of plunder They sacked the temples and public buildings
and private houses and the emperor's palace and they took off to
their ships immense quantities of gold and silver and jewels and
furniture and destroyed hundreds of beautiful and priceless works
of art

Illustration THE VANDALS IN ROME

The Vandal king also put to death a number of Roman citizens and
carried away many more as slaves He took Eudoxia and her daughters
with him to Carthage One of the daughters was soon afterwards
married to Genseric's eldest son Hunneric

III

Some years after the capture of Rome by Genseric there was a Roman
emperor named Ma-jo'ri-an He was a good ruler and a brave man
The Vandals still continued to attack and plunder cities in Italy
and other countries belonging to Rome and Majorian resolved to
punish them So he got together a great army and built a fleet
of three hundred ships to carry his troops to Carthage

But he first marched his men across the Alps through Gaul and
down to the seaport of Carthagena in Spain where his fleet was
stationed He took this route because he expected to add to his
forces as he went along Before sailing with his army for Carthage
he wished very much to see with his own eyes what sort of people
the Vandals were and whether they were so powerful at home as was
generally believed

So he dyed his hair and disguised himself in other ways and went
to Carthage pretending that he was a messenger or ambassador from
the Roman emperor coming to talk about peace Genseric received
him with respect and entertained him hospitably not knowing that
he was the Emperor Majorian Of course peace was not made The
emperor left Carthage after having got as much information as he
could

But Genseric did not wait for the Roman fleet to come to attack
him in his capital When he got word that it was in the Bay of
Carthagena he sailed there with a fleet of his own and in a single
day burned or sank nearly all the Roman ships

After this the Vandals became more than ever the terror of the
Mediterranean and all the countries bordering upon it Every year
their ships went round the coasts from Asia Minor to Spain attacking
and plundering cities on their way and carrying off prisoners

All the efforts of the Romans failed to put a stop to these ravages
The Emperor Leo who ruled over the eastern division of the Empire
fitted out a great fleet at Constantinople to make another attempt
to suppress the pirates There were more than a thousand ships in
this fleet and they carried a hundred thousand men The command
of the expedition was given to Bas-il'i-cus the brother of Emperor
Leo's wife

Basilicus sailed with his ships to Africa and landed the army not
far from Carthage Genseric asked for a truce for five days to
consider terms of peace and the truce was granted But the cunning
Vandal was not thinking of peace He only wanted time to carry
out a plan he had made to destroy the Roman fleet

One dark night during the truce he filled the largest of his
ships with some of the bravest of his soldiers and they sailed
silently and cautiously in among the Roman ships towing behind
them large boats filled with material that would easily burn

These boats were set on fire and floated against the Roman vessels
which also were soon on fire The flames quickly spread and in
a very short time a great part of the Roman fleet was destroyed
Basilicus fled with as many ships as he could save and returned
to Constantinople

This was the last attempt of the Romans to conquer the Vandals
Genseric lived to a good old age and when he died in 477 all
the countries he had conquered during his life still remained parts
of the Vandal dominions




THEODORIC THE OSTROGOTH

KING FROM 475-526 AD

I

The Ostrogoths or East Goths who had settled in Southern Russia
at length pushed southward and westward to the mouth of the Danube

They were continually invading countries belonging to the Romans
and their warlike raids were dreaded by the emperors of the Eastern
Roman Empire who lived at Constantinople One emperor gave them
land and money and thus stopped their invasions for a time

The most famous of the Ostrogoth kings was The-od'or-ic the Great
He was the son of The-od'e-mir who was also a king of the Ostrogoths
When Theodoric was eight years old he was sent to Constantinople to
be held as a hostage by Leo the Emperor of the East In former
times when kings made treaties with one another it was customary
for one to give to the other a pledge or security that he would
fulfill the conditions of the treaty The pledge usually given
was some important person or persons perhaps the king's son or a
number of his chief men Persons so given as a security were called
hostages When Theodoric was a boy he was given as a hostage for
his father's good faith in carrying out a treaty with the Emperor
and was sent to Constantinople to live Here the youth was well
treated by Leo He was educated with great care and trained in
all the exercises of war

Theodemir died in 475 and then Theodoric returned to his own country
and became king of the Ostrogoths At this time he was eighteen
years of age He was handsome and brave and people loved him for
in those days a man who was tall and strong and brave was liked
by everybody

II

For some years after he became king Theodoric had frequent wars
with other Gothic kings and also with the Roman Emperor Ze'no
He was nearly always successful in battle and at last Zeno began
to think it would be better to try to make friends with him So
he gave Theodoric some rich lands and made him commander of the
Imperial Guard of Constantinople

But the Emperor soon became tired of having the Ostrogoth king at
his court and to get rid of him he agreed that Theodoric should
go with his army to Italy and take that country from O-do-a'-cer
Theodoric was delighted at the proposal and began at once to make
his preparations

Odoacer was at that time king of Italy Before he became king he
had been a general in the army of Romulus Augustulus the Western
Roman Emperor The soldiers of the army were not satisfied with
their pay and when they asked for more they did not get it Then
they drove Romulus Augustulus from the throne and chose Odoacer
to succeed him But Odoacer would not take the name of emperor
He was called the patrician of Italy and he ruled the country
well

Theodoric started for Italy not only with a great army but with
all the people of his country He meant to take Italy and be its
king and settle in it with all his Ostrogoths When he set out he
had with him two hundred and fifty thousand persons men women
and children with a great number of horses and wagons to carry
them and their things He had also an army of sixty thousand brave
soldiers

It was a long and weary journey from the shores of the Black Sea
overland to the foot of the Alps Mountains and across the Alps
into Italy Here and there on the way they met savage tribes that
tried to stop them but Theodoric defeated the savages and took
a great many of them prisoners He made these prisoners women
as well as men help carry the baggage and do other work

Illustration INVASION OF BARBARIANS

The journey took months but at last the Ostrogoths reached the
top of the Alps Then they could see stretched out before them
the beautiful land of Italy They were all delighted They shouted
and danced with joy and Theodoric cried out

There is the country which shall be our home Let us march on
It certainly shall be ours

Then they passed quickly down and soon they were in Italy Odoacer
had heard of their coming and he got ready an army to drive them
away Theodoric also got his fighting men ready The two armies
met and there was a great battle near the town of Aquileia Odoacer
was defeated Then he tried to get Theodoric to leave Italy by
offering him a large sum of money

I will give you said he thousands of pounds of gold and silver
if you agree to go back to your own country

But Theodoric would not go He said he had as good a right to be
king of Italy as Odoacer and he would remain and conquer the country
and be its king Soon after there was another battle near Verona
and Odoacer was again defeated

Theodoric came very near being killed in battle He was saved only
by the courage of his mother She was in his camp and at one time
she saw a number of the Ostrogoths running away from that part
of the battle-field where her son was fighting thus leaving him
without support The mother rushed forward and stopped the fleeing
men She made them feel that it was a shame for them to desert
their leader and they at once returned to the field and fought
beside their king until the battle was won

After the battle of Verona Odoacer went with his army to the city
of Ravenna and remained there for some time Theodoric followed
with his Ostrogoths and tried to take the city but there was a
very strong wall around it and the Ostrogoths could not capture
it Although Theodoric was not able to take Ravenna he did not
remain idle He marched off to other parts of the country and
took possession of towns and districts wherever he went

After a while Odoacer got together a better army than he had before
and made another effort to defeat Theodoric But he again failed
Theodoric defeated him in another great battle which was fought
on the banks of the River Adda After this battle Odoacer again
fled to Ravenna Theodoric followed again and laid siege to the
city This time his army surrounded it and kept provisions from
being sent in and at last when there was no food in the city
for the soldiers or the people to eat Odoacer had to surrender

A treaty was then made between the two kings and both agreed that
they should rule together over Italy each to have equal power But
a few days afterwards Theodoric murdered Odoacer while sitting at
a banquet and then made himself the sole king of Italy He divided
one-third of the land of the country among his own followers So the
Ostrogoths settled in Italy and Ostrogoths Romans and Visigoths
were governed by Theodoric as one people

Theodoric died at the age of seventy-one after ruling Italy for
thirty-three years




CLOVIS

KING FROM 481-511 AD

I

While the power of the Roman Empire was declining there dwelt on
the banks of the River Rhine a number of savage Teuton tribes called
Franks The word Frank means free and those tribes took pride
in being known as Franks or freemen

The Franks occupied the east bank of the Rhine for about two hundred
years Then many of the tribes crossed the river in search of new
homes The region west of the river was at that time called Gaul
Here the Franks established themselves and became a powerful people
From their name the country was afterwards called France

Each tribe of the Franks had its own king The greatest of all
these kings was Chlodwig or Clovis as we call him who became
ruler of his tribe in the year 481 just six years after Theodoric
became king of the Ostrogoths Clovis was then only sixteen years
of age But though he was so young he proved in a very short time
that he could govern as well as older men He was intelligent and
brave No one ever knew him to be afraid of anything even when
he was but a child His father who was named Chil'der-ic often
took him to wars which the Franks had with neighboring tribes and
he was very proud of his son's bravery The young man was also a
bold and skillful horseman He could tame and ride the most fiery
horse

When Clovis became king of the Franks a great part of Gaul still
belonged to Rome This part was then governed by a Roman general
named Sy-ag'ri-us Clovis resolved to drive the Romans out of the
country and he talked over the matter with the head men of his
army

My desire said he is that the Franks shall have possession of
every part of this fair land I shall drive the Romans and their
friends away and make Gaul the empire of the Franks

II

At this time the Romans had a great army in Gaul It was encamped
near the city of Soissons swah-sonand was commanded by Syagrius
Clovis resolved to attack it and led his army at once to Soissons
When he came near the city he summoned Syagrius to surrender Syagrius
refused and asked for an interview with the commander of the Franks
Clovis consented to meet him and an arrangement was made that
the meeting should take place in the open space between the two
armies When Clovis stepped out in front of his own army accompanied
by some of his savage warriors Syagrius also came forward But
the moment he saw the king of the Franks he laughed loudly and
exclaimed

A boy A boy has come to fight me The Franks with a boy to lead
them have come to fight the Romans

Clovis was very angry at this insulting language and shouted back

Ay but this boy will conquer you

Then both sides prepared for battle The Romans thought that they
would win the victory easily but they were mistaken Every time
that they made a charge upon the Franks they were beaten back by
the warriors of Clovis The young king himself fought bravely at
the head of his men and with his own sword struck down a number
of the Romans He tried to find Syagrius and fight with him but
the Roman commander was nowhere to be found Early in the battle
he had fled from the field leaving his men to defend themselves
as best they could

The Franks gained a great victory With their gallant boy king
leading them on they drove the Roman's before them and when the
battle was over they took possession of the city of Soissons Clovis
afterwards conquered all the other Frankish chiefs and made himself
king of all the Franks

III

Not very long after Clovis became king he heard of a beautiful
young girl the niece of Gon'de-baud king of Burgundy and he
thought he would like to marry her Her name was Clo-tildeand
she was an orphan for her wicked uncle Gondebaud had killed her
father and mother Clovis sent one of his nobles to Gondebaud to
ask her for his wife At first Gondebaud thought of refusing to
let the girl go He feared that she might have him punished for
the murder of her parents if she became the wife of so powerful
a man as Clovis But he was also afraid that by refusing he would
provoke the anger of Clovis so he permitted the girl to be taken
to the court of the king of the Franks Clovis was delighted when
he saw her and they were immediately married

Clotilde was a devout Christian and she wished very much to convert
her husband who like most of his people was a worshiper of the
heathen gods But Clovis was not willing to give up his own religion
Nevertheless Clotilde continued to do every thing she could to
persuade him to become a Christian

Illustration CROSSING THE RHINE

Soon after his marriage Clovis had a war with a tribe called the
Alemanni This tribe had crossed the Rhine from Germany and taken
possession of some of the eastern provinces of Gaul Clovis speedily
got his warriors together and marched against them A battle was
fought at a place called Tolbiac not far from the present city
of Cologne In this battle the Franks were nearly beaten for the
Alemanni were fierce and brave men and skillful fighters When
Clovis saw his soldiers driven back several times he began to lose
hope but at that moment he thought of his pious wife and of the
powerful God of whom she had so often spoken Then he raised his
hands to heaven and earnestly prayed to that God

O God of Clotilde he cried help me in this my hour of need
If thou wilt give me victory now I will believe in thee

Almost immediately the course of the battle began to change in
favor of the Franks Clovis led his warriors forward once more
and this time the Alemanni fled before them in terror The Franks
gained a great victory and they believed it was in answer to the
prayer of their king

When Clovis returned home he did not forget his promise He told
Clotilde how he had prayed to her God for help and how his prayer
had been heard and he said he was now ready to become a Christian
Clotilde was very happy on hearing this and she arranged that her
husband should be baptized in the church of Rheims on the following
Christmas day

Meanwhile Clovis issued a proclamation to his people declaring
that he was a believer in Christ and giving orders that all the
images and temples of the heathen gods should be destroyed This
was immediately done and many of the people followed his example
and became Christians

Illustration THE BAPTISM OF CLOVIS

Clovis was a very earnest and fervent convert One day the bishop
of Rheims while instructing him in the doctrines of Christianity
described the death of Christ As the bishop proceeded Clovis became
much excited and at last jumped up from his seat and exclaimed

Had I been there with my brave Franks I would have avenged His
wrongs

On Christmas day a great multitude assembled in the church at Rheims
to witness the baptism of the king A large number of his fierce
warriors were baptized at the same time The service was performed
with great ceremony by the bishop of Rheims and the title of Most
Christian King was conferred on Clovis by the Pope This title
was ever afterwards borne by the kings of France

Like most of the kings and chiefs of those rude and barbarous times
Clovis often did cruel and wicked things When Rheims was captured
before he became a Christian a golden vase was taken by some soldiers
from the church The bishop asked Clovis to have it returned and
Clovis bade him wait until the division of spoils All the valuable
things taken by soldiers in war were divided among the whole army
each man getting his share according to rank Such things were
called spoils

Illustration CLOVIS FINDS FAULT WITH THE SOLDIER

When the next time came for dividing spoils Clovis asked that he
might have the vase over and above his regular share his intention
being to return it to the bishop But one of the soldiers objected
saying that the king should have no more than his fair share and
at the same time shattered the vase with his ax Clovis was very
angry but at the time said nothing Soon afterwards however
there was the usual examination of the arms of the soldiers to
see that they were in proper condition for active service Clovis
himself took part in the examination and when he came to the soldier
who had broken the vase he found fault with the condition of his
weapons and with one blow of his battle-ax struck the man dead

IV

The next war that Clovis engaged in was with some tribes of the
Goths who occupied the country called Aquitaine lying south of the
River Loire He defeated them and added Aquitaine to the kingdom
of the Franks

Clovis afterwards made war upon other people of Gaul and defeated
them At last all the provinces from the lower Rhine to the Pyrenees
Mountains were compelled to acknowledge him as king He then went
to reside at the city of Paris which he made the capital of his
kingdom He died there AD 511

The dynasty or family of kings to which he belonged is known in
history as the Merovingian dynasty It was so called from Me-ro-væ'us
the father of Childeric and grandfather of Clovis




JUSTINIAN THE GREAT

EMPEROR FROM 527-565 AD

I

In the time of Clovis the country now called Bulgaria was inhabited
by Goths One day a poor shepherd boy about sixteen years of age
left his mountain home in that country to go to the city of
Constantinople which was many miles away The boy had no money
to pay the expenses of the journey but he was determined to go
even though he should have to walk every step of the road and live
on fruits that he could gather by the way He was a bright clever
boy who had spent his life hitherto in a village but was now eager
to go out into the world to seek his fortune

Some years before this boy's uncle who was named Justin had
gone to Constantinople and joined the Roman army He was so brave
and so good a soldier that he soon came to be commander of the
imperial guard which attended the emperor

The poor shepherd boy had heard of the success of his uncle and
this was the reason why he resolved to set off for the big city So
he started down the mountain and trudged along the valley in high
hope feeling certain that he would reach the end of his journey
in safety It was a difficult and dangerous journey and it took
him several weeks for he had to go through dark forests and to
cross rivers and high hills but at last one afternoon in midsummer
he walked through the main gate of Constantinople proud and happy
that he had accomplished his purpose

He had no trouble in finding his Uncle Justin for everybody in
Constantinople knew the commander of the emperor's guards And
when the boy appeared at the great man's house and told who he
was his uncle received him with much kindness He took him into
his own family and gave him the best education that could be had
in the city

As the boy was very talented and eager for knowledge he soon became
an excellent scholar He grew up a tall good-looking man with
black eyes and curly hair and he was always richly dressed He was
well liked at the emperor's court and was respected by everybody
on account of his learning

II

One day a great change came for both uncle and nephew The emperor
died and the people chose Justin to succeed him He took the title
of Jus-ti'nus I and so the young scholar who had once been a
poor shepherd boy was now nephew of an emperor

Illustration THE COURT OF JUSTINIAN THE GREAT

After some years Justinus was advised by his nobles to take the
young man who had adopted the name of Justinian to help him in
ruling the empire Justinus agreed to this proposal for he was
now old and in feeble health and not able himself to attend to
the important affairs of government He therefore called the great
lords of his court together and in their presence he placed a crown
on the head of his nephew who thus became joint emperor with his
uncle The uncle died only a few months after and then Justinian
was declared emperor This was in the year 527 Justinian reigned
for nearly forty years and did so many important things that he
was afterwards called Justinian the Great

He had many wars during his reign but he himself did not take
part in them He was not experienced as a soldier for he had spent
most of his time in study He was fortunate enough however to
have two great generals to lead his armies One of them was named
Belisarius and the other Narses

Belisarius was one of the greatest soldiers that ever lived He
gained wonderful victories for Justinian and conquered some of
the old Roman provinces that had been lost for many years

The victories of these two generals largely helped to make the
reign of Justinian remarkable in history Many years before he
ascended the throne the Vandals as you have read conquered the
northern part of Africa and established a kingdom there with Carthage
as its capital The Vandal king in the time of Justinian was named
Gel'i-mer and he lived in Carthage

Justinian resolved to make war on this king in order to recover
Northern Africa and make it again a part of the Empire So Belisarius
was sent to Africa with an army of thirty-five thousand men and
five thousand horses that were carried on a fleet of six hundred
ships It took this fleet three months to make the voyage from
Constantinople to Africa The same voyage may now be made in a very
few days But in the time of Belisarius there were no steamships
and nothing was known of the power of steam for moving machinery
The ships or galleys were sailing vessels and when there was no
wind they could make no progress except by rowing

When Belisarius reached Africa he left five men as a guard in each
vessel and with the body of his army he marched for some days
along the coast The people received him in a friendly way for
they had grown tired of the rule of the Vandals and preferred
to be under the government of the Romans

About ten miles from Carthage he met a large army led by the brother
of Gelimer A battle immediately took place and the Vandals were
utterly defeated Gelimer's brother was killed and the king himself
who had followed with another army and joined the fight was also
defeated and fled from the field Belisarius then proceeded to
Carthage and took possession of the city

Illustration THE BATTLE AT CARTHAGE

Soon afterwards Gelimer collected another army and fought the Romans
in another battle twenty miles from Carthage but Belisarius again
defeated him and the Vandal king again fled This was the end of
the Vandal king in Africa In a short time Gelimer gave himself
up to Belisarius who took him to Constantinople Justinian set
apart an estate for him to live upon and the conquered king passed
the rest of his life in peaceful retirement

After conquering the Vandals Justinian resolved to conquer Italy
which was then held by the Ostrogoths A large army was got together
and put under the command of Belisarius and Narses who immediately
set out for Italy When they arrived there they marched straight
to Rome and after some fighting took possession of the city But
in a few months Vit'i-ges king of the Goths appeared with an
army before the gates and challenged Belisarius and Narses to come
out and fight

The Roman generals however were not then ready to fight and so
the Ostrogoth king laid siege to the city thinking that he would
compel the Romans to surrender

But instead of having any thought of surrender Belisarius was
preparing his men for fight and when they were ready he attacked
Vitiges and defeated him Vitiges retired to Ravenna and Belisarius
quickly followed and made such an assault on the city that it
was compelled to surrender The Ostrogoth army was captured and
Vitiges was taken to Constantinople a prisoner

Belisarius and Narses then went to Northern Italy and after a long
war conquered all the tribes there Thus the power of Justinian
was established throughout the whole country and the city of Rome
was again under the dominion of a Roman emperor

Illustration BELISARIUS BESIEGES RAVENNA

While his brave generals were winning these victories for the Empire
Justinian himself was busy in making improvements of various kinds
at the capital He erected great public buildings which were not
only useful but ornamental to the city The most remarkable of
them was the very magnificent cathedral of St So-phi'a for a
long time the grandest church structure in the world The great
temple still exists in all its beauty and grandeur but is now
used as a Mohammedan mosque

But the most important thing that Justinian did the work for which
he is most celebrated was the improving and collecting of the
laws He made many excellent new laws and reformed many of the old
laws so that he became famous as one of the greatest of the world's
legislators For a long time the Roman laws had been difficult to
understand There was a vast number of them and different writers
differed widely as to what the laws really were and what they meant
Justinian employed a great lawyer named Trib-o'ni-an to collect
and simplify the principal laws The collection which he made was
called the CODE OF JUSTINIAN It still exists and is the model
according to which most of the countries of Europe have made their
laws

Justinian also did a great deal of good by establishing a number
of manufactures in Constantinople It was he who first brought
silk-worms into Europe

To the last year of his life Justinian was strong and active and
a hard worker He often worked or studied all day and all night
without eating or sleeping He died in 565 at the age of eighty-three
years




MOHAMMED

LIVED FROM 570-632 AD

I

A great number of people in Asia and Africa and much of those in
Turkey in Europe profess the Mo-ham'me-dan religion They are called
Mohammedans Mus'sul-mans or Moslems and the proper name for their
religion is Islam which means obedience or submission

The founder of this religion was a man named Mo-ham'med or Ma-hom'et
He was born in the year 570 in Mecca a city of Arabia His parents
were poor people though it is said they were descended from
Arabian princes They died when Mohammed was a child and his uncle
a kind-hearted man named A'bu-Ta-lïbtook him home and brought
him up

When the boy grew old enough he took care of his uncle's sheep and
camels Sometimes he went on journeys with his uncle to different
parts of Arabia to help him in his business as a trader On these
journeys Mohammed used to ride on a camel and he soon became a
skillful camel-driver

Mohammed was very faithful and honest in all his work He always
spoke the truth and never broke a promise I have given my promise
he would say and I must keep it He became so well known in
Mecca for being truthful and trustworthy that people gave him the
name of El Amin which means the truthful

At this time he was only sixteen years of age but the rich traders
had so much confidence in him that they gave him important business
to attend to and trusted him with large sums of money He often
went with caravans to a port on the shore of the Red Sea sixty-five
miles from Mecca and sold there the goods carried by the camels
Then he guided the long line of camels back to Mecca and faithfully
paid over to the owners of the goods the money he had received

Mohammed had no school education He could neither read nor write
But he was not ignorant He knew well how to do the work intrusted
to him and was a first-rate man of business

II

One day when Mohammed was about twenty-five years old he was
walking through the bazaar or market-place of Mecca when he met
the chief camel-driver of a wealthy woman named Kha-dï'jah This
woman was a widow who was carrying on the business left her by
her husband As soon as the camel-driver saw Mohammed he stopped
him and said

My mistress wishes to see you before noon I think she intends
to engage you to take charge of her caravans

Mohammed waited to hear no more As quickly as possible he went
to the house of Khadijah for he was well pleased at the thought
of being employed in so important a service The widow received
him in a very friendly way She said

I have heard much of you among the traders They say that though
you are so young you are a good caravan manager and can be trusted
Are you willing to take charge of my caravans and give your whole
time and service to me

Mohammed was delighted

I accept your offer said he and I shall do all I can to serve
and please you

Khadijah then engaged him as the manager of her business and he
served her well and faithfully She thought a great deal of him
and he was much attracted to her and soon they came to love one
another and were married

As he was now the husband of a rich woman he did not need to work
very hard He still continued to attend to his wife's business
but he did not make so many journeys as before He spent much of
his time in thinking about religion He learned all that he could
about Judaism and Christianity but he was not satisfied with either
of them

At that time most of the people of Arabia worshiped idols Very
few of them were Christians

Mohammed was very earnest and serious In a cave on Mount Hira near
Mecca he spent several weeks every year in prayer and religious
meditation He declared that while praying in his cave he often
had visions of God and heaven He said that many times the angel
Gabriel appeared to him and revealed to him the religion which he
afterwards taught his followers As he himself could not write
he committed to memory all that the angel told him and had it
written in a book This book is called the Koran which means
like our own word Bible the Book The Koran is the Bible of
Mohammedans

III

When Mohammed returned home after the angel had first spoken to
him he told his wife of what he had seen and heard She at once
believed and so became a convert to the new religion She fell
upon her knees at the feet of her husband and cried out

There is but one God Mohammed is God's prophet

Mohammed then told the story to other members of his family Some
of them believed and became his first followers Soon afterwards
he began to preach to the people He spoke in the market and other
public places Most of those who heard him laughed at what he told
them but some poor people and a few slaves believed him and adopted
the new religion Others said he was a dreamer and a fool

Mohammed however paid no heed to the insults he received He
went on telling about the appearance of Gabriel and preaching the
doctrines which he said the angel had ordered him to teach the
people

Often while speaking in public Mohammed had what he called a vision
of heavenly things At such times his face grew pale as death
his eyes became red and staring he spoke in a loud voice and
his body trembled violently Then he would tell what he had seen
in his vision

After a time the number of his followers began to increase People
came from distant parts of Arabia and from neighboring countries
to hear him One day six of the chief men of Me-dï'na one of the
largest cities of Arabia listened earnestly to his preaching and
were converted When they returned home they talked of the new
religion to their fellow-citizens and a great many of them became
believers

But the people of Mecca Mohammed's own home were nearly all opposed
to him They would not believe what he preached and they called him
an impostor The people of the tribe to which he himself belonged
were the most bitter against him They even threatened to put him
to death as an enemy of the gods

About this time Mohammed's uncle and wife died and he had then
hardly any friends in Mecca He therefore resolved to leave that
city and go to Medina Numbers of the people there believed his
doctrines and wished him to come and live among them So he secretly
left his native town and fled from his enemies With a few faithful
companions he made his escape to Medina

It was in the year of our Lord 622 that Mohammed fled from Mecca
This event is very important in Mohammedan history It is called
the flight of the prophet or the Hej'i-ra a word which means
flight The Hejira is the beginning of the Mohammedan era and
so in all countries where the rulers and people are Mohammedans
the years are counted from the Hejira instead of from the birth
of Christ

Illustration THE MOSQUE OF AHMEDIEH AND THE OBELISK AT CONSTANTINOPLE

On his arrival in Medina the people received Mohammed with great
rejoicing He lived there the remainder of his life A splendid
church was built for him in Medina It was called a mosque and
all Mohammedan churches or places of worship are called by this
name It means a place for prostration or prayer

IV

Mohammed thought that it was right to spread his religion by force
and to make war on unbelievers as he called all people who did
not accept his teaching He therefore got together an army and fought
battles and unbelievers He gained many victories He marched against
Mecca with an army of ten thousand men and the city surrendered
with little resistance The people then joined his religion and
destroyed their idols Before very long all the inhabitants of
Arabia and many of the people of the neighboring countries became
Mohammedans

Mohammed died in Medina in the year of our Lord 632 or year 11
of the Hejira He was buried in the mosque in which he had held
religious services for so many years and Medina has ever since
been honored because it contains the tomb of the Prophet It is
believed by his followers that the body still lies in the coffin
in the same state as when it was first buried There is also a
story that the coffin of Mohammed rests somewhere between heaven
and earth suspended in the air But this fable was invented by
enemies to bring ridicule on the prophet and his religion

The tomb of Mohammed is visited every year by people from all Mohammedan
countries Mecca the birthplace of the prophet is also visited by
vast numbers of pilgrims Every Mussulman is bound by his religion
to make a visit or pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his life
Whenever a Mussulman prays no matter in what part of the world
he may be he turns his face towards Mecca as if he were always
thinking of going there

Illustration PILGRIMS MARCHING THROUGH THE DESERT TO MECCA

Good Mohammedans pray five times every day and there is a church
officer called a mu-ez'zin who gives them notice of the hour for
prayer This he does by going on the platform or balcony of the
minaret or tower of the mosque and chanting in a loud voice such
words as these

Come to prayer come to prayer There is no god but God He giveth
life and he dieth not I praise his perfection God is great

In Mecca there is a mosque called the Great Mosque It is a large
enclosure in the form of a quadrangle or square which can hold
35000 persons It is enclosed by arcades with pillars of marble
and granite and has nineteen gates each with a minaret or pointed
tower above it

Illustration A MUEZZIN CALLING TO PRAYER

Within this enclosure is a famous building called the Ká'a-ba
or cube It is nearly a cube in shape It its wall at one corner
is the celebrated Black Stone Moslems regard this stone with
the greatest reverence They say that it came down from heaven
It is said to have been once white but has become dark from being
wept upon and touched by so many millions of pilgrims It really
is reddish-brown in color

Before the time of Mohammed the Ká'a-ba was a pagan temple but
when he took possession of Mecca he made the old temple the centre
of worship for his own religion

After Mohammed died a person was appointed to be his successor as
head of the Moslem church He was called the caliph a word which
means successor and this title has been borne ever since by the
religious chief of the Mohammedans In modern times the sultans or
rulers of Turkey have been commonly regarded as the caliphs Arab
scholars however say that really the she-rïf ie the governor
of Mecca is entitled by the Koran to hold this position




CHARLES MARTEL 714-741 AD

AND

PEPIN 741-768 AD

I

After the death of Mohammed the Saracens as Mohammedans are also
called became great warriors They conquered many countries and
established the Mohammedan religion in them In 711 the Saracens
invaded and conquered a great part of Spain and founded a powerful
kingdom there which lasted about seven hundred years

They intended to conquer the land of the Franks next and then all
Europe

They thought it would be easy to conquer the Franks because the
Frankish king at that time was a very weak man He was one of a
number of kings who were called the Do-nothings They reigned
from about 638 to 751 They spent all their time in amusements
and pleasures leaving the affairs of the government to be managed
by persons called mayors of the palace

The mayors of the palace were officers who at first managed the
king's household Afterwards they were made guardians of kings
who came to the throne when very young So long as the king was
under age the mayor of the palace acted as chief officer of the
government in his name And as several of the young kings even
when they were old enough to rule gave less attention to business
than to pleasure the mayors continued to do all the business
until at last they did everything that the king ought to have done
They made war led armies in battle raised money and spent it
and carried on the government as they pleased without consulting
the king

The Do-nothings had the title of king but nothing more In fact
they did not desire to have any business to do The things they
cared for were dogs horses and sport

One of the most famous of the mayors was a man named Pep'in Once
a year it is said Pepin had the king dressed in his finest clothes
and paraded through the city of Paris where the court was held
A splendid throng of nobles and courtiers accompanied the king
and did him honor as he went along the streets in a gilded chariot
drawn by a long line of beautiful horses The king was cheered by
the people and he acknowledged their greetings most graciously

After the parade the king was escorted to the great hall of the
palace which was filled with nobles Seated on a magnificent throne
he saluted the assemblage and made a short speech The speech was
prepared beforehand by Pepin and committed to memory by the king
At the close of the ceremony the royal nobody retired to his
country house and was not heard of again for a year

II

Pepin died in 714 AD and his son Charles who was twenty-five
years old at that time succeeded him as mayor of the palace This
Charles is known in history as Charles Martel He was a brave young
man He had fought in many of his father's battles and so had become
a skilled soldier His men were devoted to him

While he was mayor of the palace he led armies in several wars
against the enemies of the Franks The most important of his wars
was one with the Saracens who came across the Pyrenees from Spain and
invaded the land of the Franks intending to establish Mohammedanism
there Their army was led by Abd-er-Rah'man the Saracen governor
of Spain

Illustration CHARLES MARTEL AT TOURS

On his march through the southern districts of the land of the
Franks Abd-er-Rahman destroyed many towns and villages killed a
number of the people and seized all the property he could carry
off He plundered the city of Bordeaux bor-doand it is
said obtained so many valuable things that every soldier was
loaded with golden vases and cups and emeralds and other precious
stones

But meanwhile Charles Martel was not idle As quickly as he could
he got together a great army of Franks and Germans and marched
against the Saracens The two armies met between the cities of
Tours and Poitiers pwaw-te-ay in October 732 For six days
there was nothing but an occasional skirmish between small parties
from both sides but on the seventh day a great battle took place

Both Christians and Mohammedans fought with terrible earnestness
The fight went on all day and the field was covered with the bodies
of the slain But towards evening during a resolute charge made by
the Franks Abd-er-Rahman was killed Then the Saracens gradually
retired to their camp

It was not yet known however which side had won and the Franks
expected that the fight would be renewed in the morning

But when Charles Martel with his Christian warriors appeared on
the field at sunrise there was no enemy to fight The Mohammedans
had fled in the silence and darkness of the night and had left
behind them all their valuable spoils There was now no doubt which
side had won

The battle of Tours or Poitiers as it should be called is regarded
as one of the decisive battles of the world It decided that Christians
and not Moslems should be the ruling power in Europe

Charles Martel is especially celebrated as the hero of this battle
It is said that the name Martel was given to him because of his
bravery during the fight Marteau mar-tois the French word
for hammer and one of the old French historians says that as a
hammer breaks and crushes iron and steel so Charles broke and
crushed the power of his enemies in the battle of Tours

But though the Saracens fled from the battlefield of Tours they
did not leave the land of the Franks and Charles had to fight
other battles with them before they were finally defeated At
last however he drove them across the Pyrenees and they never
again attempted to invade Frankland

After his defeat of the Saracens Charles Martel was looked upon as
the great champion of Christianity and to the day of his death
in 741 he was in reality though not in name the king of the
Franks

III

Charles Martel had two sons Pepin and Carloman For a time they
ruled together but Carloman wished to lead a religious life so he
went to a monastery and became a monk Then Pepin was sole ruler

Pepin was quite low in stature and therefore was called Pepin
the Short But he had great strength and courage A story is told
of him which shows how fearless he was

One day he went with a few of his nobles to a circus to see a fight
between a lion and a bull Soon after the fight began it looked
as though the bull was getting the worst of it Pepin cried out
to his companions

Will one of you separate the beasts

But there was no answer None of them had the courage to make the
attempt Then Pepin jumped from his seat rushed into the arena
and with a thrust of his sword killed the lion

In the early years of Pepin's rule as mayor of the palace the throne
was occupied by a king named Chil'der-ic III Like his father and
the other do-nothing kings Childeric cared more for pleasures
and amusements than for affairs of government Pepin was the real
ruler and after a while he began to think that he ought to have
the title of king as he had all the power and did all the work
of governing and defending the kingdom

So he sent some friends to Rome to consult the Pope They said to
His Holiness

Holy father who ought to be the king of France the man who has
the title or the man who has the power and does all the duties
of king

Certainly replied the Pope the man who has the power and does
the duties

Then surely said they Pepin ought to be the king of the Franks
for he has all the power

The Pope gave his consent and Pepin was crowned king of the Franks
and thus the reign of Childeric ended and that of Pepin began

During nearly his whole reign Pepin was engaged in war Several
times he went to Italy to defend the Pope against the Lombards
These people occupied certain parts of Italy including the province
still called Lombardy

Pepin conquered them and gave as a present to the Pope that part
of their possessions which extended for some distance around Rome
This was called Pepin's Donation It was the beginning of what is
known as the temporal power of the Popes that is their power
as rulers of part of Italy

Pepin died in 768




CHARLEMAGNE

KING FROM 768-814 AD

I

Pepin had two sons Charles and Carloman After the death of their
father they ruled together but in a few years Carloman died and
then Charles became sole king

This Charles was the most famous of the kings of the Franks He did
so many great and wonderful things that he is called Charlemagne
shar-le-mainwhich means Charles the Great

He was a great soldier For thirty years he carried on a war against
the Saxons Finally he conquered them and their great chief Wittekind
submitted to him The Saxons were a people of Germany who then
lived near the land of the Franks They spoke the same language
and were of the same race as the Franks but had not been civilized
by contact with the Romans

They were still pagans just as the Franks had been before Clovis
became a Christian They actually offered human sacrifices

After Charlemagne conquered them he made their lands part of his
kingdom A great number of them among whom was Wittekind then
became Christians and were baptized and soon they had churches
and schools in many parts of their country

Another of Charlemagne's wars was against the Lombards

Pepin as you have read had defeated the Lombards and given to
the Pope part of the country held by them The Lombard king now
invaded the Pope's lands and threatened Rome itself so the Pope
sent to Charlemagne for help

Charlemagne quickly marched across the Alps and attacked the Lombards
He drove them out of the Pope's lands and took possession of their
country

After he had conquered the Lombards he carried on war in 778
in Spain A large portion of Spain was then held by the Moorish
Saracens But a Mohammedan leader from Damascus had invaded their
country and the Moors invited Charlemagne to help them He therefore
led an army across the Pyrenees He succeeded in putting his Moorish
friends in possession of their lands in Spain and then set out on
his return to his own country

On the march his army was divided into two parts The main body
was led by Charlemagne himself The rear guard was commanded by a
famous warrior named Roland While marching through the narrow pass
of Roncesvalles ron-thes-val'yes among the Pyrenees Roland's
division was attacked by a tribe called the Basques basks who
lived on the mountain slopes of the neighboring region

Illustration THE BAPTISM OF WITTEKIND

High cliffs walled in the pass on either side From the tops of
these cliffs the Basques hurled down rocks and trunks of trees
upon the Franks and crushed many of them to death Besides this
the wild mountaineers descended into the pass and attacked them
with weapons Roland fought bravely but at last he was overpowered
and he and all his men were killed

Roland had a friend and companion named Oliver who was as brave
as himself Many stories and songs have been written telling of
the wonderful adventures they were said to have had and of their
wonderful deeds in war

The work of Charlemagne in Spain was quickly undone for Abd-er-Rahman
the leader of the Mohammedans who had come from Damascus soon
conquered almost all the territory south of the Pyrenees

Illustration ROLAND IN THE BATTLE OF RONCESVALLES

For more than forty years Charlemagne was king of the Franks but
a still greater dignity was to come to him In the year 800 some
of the people in Rome rebelled against the Pope and Charlemagne
went with an army to put down the rebellion He entered the city
with great pomp and soon conquered the rebels On Christmas day
he went to the church of St Peter and as he knelt before the
altar the Pope placed a crown upon his head saying

Long live Charles Augustus Emperor of the Romans

The people assembled in the church shouted the same words and so
Charlemagne was now emperor of the Western Roman Empire as well
as king of the Franks

Footnote The emperors of Constantinople still called themselves
Roman Emperors and still claimed Italy Germany and France as
parts of their empire though really their authority had not been
respected in these countries for more than 300 years

Charlemagne built a splendid palace at Aix-la-Chapelle
aks-la-shap-ela town in Germany where perhaps he was born

Charlemagne was a tall man with long flowing beard and of noble
appearance He dressed in very simple style but when he went into
battle he wore armor as was the custom for kings and nobles and
often for ordinary soldiers in his day

Illustration THE POPE CROWNING CHARLEMAGNE

Armor was made of leather or iron or both together There was a
helmet of iron for the head and a breastplate to cover the breast
or a coat of mail to cover the body The coat of mail was made of
small iron or steel rings linked together or fastened on to a
leather shirt Coverings for the legs and feet were often attached
to the coat

II

Charlemagne was a great king in may other ways besides the fighting
of battles He did much for the good of his people He made many
excellent laws and appointed judges to see that the laws were carried
out He established schools and placed good teachers in charge of
them He had a school in his palace for his own children and he
employed as their teacher a very learned Englishman named Alcuin
al'kwin

In those times few people could read or write There were not many
schools anywhere and in most places there were none at all Even
the kings had little education Indeed few of them could write
their own names and most of them did not care about sending their
children to school They did not think that reading or writing was
of much use but thought that it was far better for boys to learn
to be good soldiers and for girls to learn to spin and weave

Charlemagne had a very different opinion He was fond of learning
and whenever he heard of a learned man living in any foreign country
he tried to get him to come and live in Frankland

The fame of Charlemagne as a great warrior and a wise emperor spread
all over the world Many kings sent messengers to him to ask his
friendship and bring him presents Harun-al-Rashid hah-roon'
al rash'-eed the famous caliph who lived at Bagdad in Asia
sent him an elephant and a clock which struck the hours

The Franks were much astonished at the sight of the elephant for
they had never seen one before They also wondered much at the
clock In those days there were in Europe no clocks such as we
have but water-clocks and hour-glasses were used in some places
The water-clock was a vessel into which water was allowed to trickle
It contained a float which pointed to a scale of hours at the side
of the vessel The float gradually rose as the water trickled in

The hour-glasses measured time by the falling of fine sand from
the top to the bottom of a glass vessel made with a narrow neck in
the middle for the sand to go through They were like the little
glasses called egg-timers which are used for measuring the time
for boiling eggs

Illustration CHARLEMAGNE

Charlemagne died in 814 He was buried in the church which he had
built at Aix-la-Chapelle His body was placed in the tomb seated
upon a grand chair dressed in royal robes with a crown on the
head a sword at the side and a Bible in the hands

This famous emperor is known in history as Charlemagne which is
the French word for the German name Karl der Grosse Charles the
Great the name by which he was called at his own court during
his life The German name would really be a better name for him
for he was a German and German was the language that he spoke
The common name of his favorite residence Aix-la-Chapelle also
is French but he knew the place as Aachen ä'chen

The great empire which Charlemagne built up held together only
during the life of his son Then it was divided among his three
grandsons Louis took the eastern part Lo-thairetook the central
part with the title of emperor and Charles took the western part




HARUN-AL-RASHID

CALIPH FROM 786-809 AD

I

The most celebrated of all Mohammedan caliphs was Harun-al-Rashid
which means in English Aaron the Just Harun is the hero of several
of the stories of the Arabian Nights a famous book which perhaps
you have read There are many curious and wonderful tales in it

When Harun was only eighteen years old he showed such courage and
skill as a soldier that his father who was then caliph allowed
him to lead an army against the enemies of the Mohammedans and
he won many great victories

He afterwards commanded an army of ninety-five thousand Arabs and
Persians sent by his father to invade the Eastern Roman Empire
which was then ruled by the Empress Irene i-re'ne After defeating
Irene's famous general Nicetas ni-ce'tas Harun marched his
army to Chrys-op'o-lis now Scutari skoo'ta-re on the Asiatic
coast opposite Constantinople He encamped on the heights in
full view of the Roman capital

The Empress saw that the city would certainly by taken by the Moslems
She therefore sent ambassadors to Harun to arrange terms but he
sternly refused to agree to anything except immediate surrender

Then one of the ambassadors said The Empress has heard much of
your ability as a general Though you are her enemy she admires
you as a soldier

These flattering words were pleasing to Harun He walked to and
fro in front of his tent and then spoke again to the ambassadors

Tell the Empress he said that I will spare Constantinople
if she will pay me seventy thousand pieces of gold as a yearly
tribute If the tribute is regularly paid Constantinople shall not
be harmed by any Moslem force

The Empress had to agree to these terms She paid the first year's
tribute and soon the great Moslem army set out on its homeward
march

When Harun was not quite twenty-one years old he became caliph

He began his reign by appointing very able ministers who carried
on the work of the government so well that they greatly improved
the condition of the people

Harun built a palace in Bagdad far grander and more beautiful
than that of any caliph before him Here he established his court
and lived in great splendor attended by hundreds of courtiers
and slaves

He was very anxious that his people should be treated justly by
the officers of the government and he was determined to find out
whether any had reason to complain So he sometimes disguised himself
at night and went about through the streets and bazaars listening
to the talk of those whom he met and asking them questions In
this way he learned whether the people were contented and happy
or not

In those times Bagdad in the east and the Mohammedan cities of
Spain in the west were famed for their schools and learned men
Arabian teachers first introduced into Western Europe both algebra
and the figures which we use in arithmetic It is for this reason
that we call these figures the Arabic numerals

Harun-al-Rashid gave great encouragement to learning He was a
scholar and poet himself and whenever he heard of learned men in
his own kingdom or in neighboring countries he invited them to
his court and treated them with respect

The name of Harun therefore became known throughout the world It
is said that a correspondence took place between him and Charlemagne
and that as you have learned Harun sent the great emperor a present
of a clock and an elephant

Illustration THE PRESENTS FROM HARUN-AL-RASHID

The tribute of gold that the Empress Irene agreed to pay Harun was
sent regularly for many years It was always received at Bagdad
with great ceremony The day on which it arrived was made a holiday
The Roman soldiers who came with it entered the gates in procession
Moslem troops also took part in the parade

When the gold had been delivered at the palace the Roman soldiers
were hospitably entertained and were escorted to the main gate of
the city when they set out on their journey back to Constantinople

II

In 802 Ni-ceph'o-rus usurped the throne of the Eastern Empire
He sent ambassadors with a letter to Harun to tell him that the
tribute would no longer be paid The letter contained these words

The weak and faint-hearted Irene submitted to pay you tribute
She ought to have made you pay tribute to her Return to me all
that she paid you else the matter must be settled by the sword

As soon as Harun had read these words the ambassadors threw a bundle
of swords at his feet The caliph smiled and drawing his own sword
or cimeter sim'e-ter he cut the Roman swords in two with one
stroke without injuring the blade or even turning the edge of
his weapon

Then he dictated a letter to Nicephorus in which he said

Harun-al-Rashid Commander of the Faithful to Nicephorus the
Roman dog I have read thy letter Thou shalt not hear thou shalt
see my reply

Illustration HARUN-AL-RASHID

Harun was as good as his word He started that day with a large
army to punish the emperor As soon as he reached Roman territory
he ravaged the country and took possession of everything valuable
that he found He laid siege to Her-a-cle'a a city on the shores
of the Black Sea and in a week forced it to surrender Then he
sacked the place

Nicephorus was now forced to agree to pay the tribute Scarcely
however had the caliph reached his palace in Bagdad when the emperor
again refused to pay

Harun consequently advanced into the Roman province of Phrygia
in Asia Minor with an army of 15000 men Nicepherus marched against
him with 125000 men In the battle which followed the emperor was
wounded and 40000 of his men were killed

After this defeat Nicephorus again promised payment of the tribute
but again failed to keep his promise

Harun now vowed that he would kill the emperor if he should ever
lay hands upon him But as he was getting ready to march once more
into the Roman provinces a revolt broke out in one of the cities
of his own kingdom and while on his way to suppress it the great
caliph died of an illness which had long given him trouble




EGBERT

KING FROM 802-837 AD

I

Egbert the Saxon lived at the same time as did Harun-al-Rashid
and Charlemagne He was the first king who ruled all England as
one kingdom Long before his birth the people who are known to
us as Britons lived there and they gave to the island the name
Britain

But Britain was invaded by the Romans under Julius Cæsar and his
successors and all that part of it which we now call England was
added to the Empire of Rome The Britons were driven into Wales
and Cornwall the western sections of the island

The Romans kept possession of the island for nearly four hundred
years They did not leave it until 410 the year that Alaric sacked
the city of Rome At this time the Roman legions were withdrawn
from Britain

Some years before this the Saxons Angles and Jutes German tribes
had settled near the shores of the North Sea They learned much
about Britain for trading vessels even at that early day crossed
the Channel Among other things the men from the north learned
that Britain was crossed with good Roman roads and dotted with
houses of brick and stone that walled cities had taken the place
of tented camps and that the country for miles round each city
was green every spring with waving wheat or white with orchard
blossoms

Illustration HENGIST AND HORSA LANDING IN ENGLAND

After the Roman legions had left Britain the Jutes led it is
said by two great captains named Hengist and Horsa landed upon
the southeastern coast and made a settlement

Britain proved a pleasant place to live in and soon the Angles
and Saxons also left the North Sea shores and invaded the beautiful
island

The new invaders met with brave resistance The Britons were headed
by King Arthur about whom many marvelous stories are told His
court was held at Caerleon cär'le-on in North Wales where
his hundred and fifty knights banqueted at their famous Round
Table

The British king and his knights fought with desperate heroism
But they could not drive back the Saxons and their companions and
were obliged to seek refuge in the western mountainous parts of
the island just as their forefathers had done when the Romans
invaded Britain Thus nearly all England came into the possession
of the three invading tribes

II

Arthur and his knights were devoted Christians For the Romans
had not only made good roads and built strong walls and forts in
Britain but they had also brought the Christian religion into the
island And at about the time of the Saxon invasion St Patrick
was founding churches and monasteries in Ireland and was baptizing
whole clans of the Irish at a time It is said that he baptized
12000 persons with his own hand Missionaries were sent out by
the Irish Church to convert the wild Picts of Scotland and at a
later day the distant barbarians of Germany and Switzerland

The Saxons Angles and Jutes believed in the old Norse gods and
Tiew and Woden Thor and Friga or Frija were worshiped on the
soil of Britain for more than a hundred years

The Britons tried to convert their conquerors but the invaders did
not care to be taught religion by those whom they had conquered
so the British missionaries found the work unusually hard Aid came
to them in a singular way At some time near the year 575 AD
the Saxons quarreled and fought with their friends the Angles
They took some Angles prisoners and carried them to Rome to be
sold in the great slave-market there A monk named Gregory passed
one day through the market and saw these captives He asked the
dealer who they were Angles was the answer

Oh said the monk they would be angels instead of Angles
if they were only Christians for they certainly have the faces
of angels

Illustration ST PATRICK BAPTIZING IRISH PRINCESSES

Years after when that monk was the Pope of Rome he remembered this
conversation and sent the monk Au-gus'tine to England to teach the
Christian religion to the savage but angel-faced Angles Augustine
and the British missionaries converted the Anglo-Saxons two hundred
years before the German Saxons were converted

Still though both Angles and Saxons called themselves Christians
they were seldom at peace and for more than two hundred years
they frequently fought Various chiefs tried to make themselves
kings and at length there came to be no less than seven small
kingdoms in South Britain

In 784 Egbert claimed to be heir of the kingdom called Wessex
but the people elected another man and Egbert had to flee for his
life He went to the court of Charlemagne and was with the great
king of the Franks in Rome on Christmas Day 800 when the Pope
placed the crown on Charleshead and proclaimed him emperor

Soon after this a welcome message came to Egbert The mind of the
people in Wessex had changed and they had elected him king So
bidding farewell to Charlemagne he hurried to England

Egbert had seen how Charlemagne had compelled the different quarreling
tribes of Germany to yield allegiance to him and how after uniting
his empire he had ruled it well

Egbert did in England what Charlemagne had done in Germany He
either persuaded the various petty kingdoms of the Angles the
Saxons and the Jutes to recognize him as their ruler or forced
them to do so and thus under him all England became one united
kingdom

But Egbert did even better than this He did much to harmonize
the different tribes by his wise conciliation The name England
is a memorial of this for though Egbert himself was a Saxon he
advised that to please the Angles the country should be called
An'gli-a that is Angleland or England the land of the Angles
instead of Sax-on-i'a or Saxonland




ROLLO THE VIKING

DIED 931 AD

I

For more than two hundred years during the Middle Ages the Christian
countries of Europe were attacked on the southwest by the Saracens
of Spain and on the northwest by the Norsemen or Northmen The
Northmen were so called because they came into Middle Europe from
the north Sometimes they were called Vi'kings or pirates because
they were adventurous sea-robbers who plundered all countries which
they could reach by sea

Their ships were long and swift In the center was placed a single
mast which carried one large sail For the most part however
the Norsemen depended on rowing not on the wind and sometimes
there were twenty rowers in one vessel

The Vikings were a terror to all their neighbors but the two regions
that suffered most from their attacks were the Island of Britain
and that part of Charlemagne's empire in which the Franks were
settled

Illustration MARAUDING EXPEDITION OF NORTHMEN

Nearly fifty times in two hundred years the lands of the Franks
were invaded The Vikings sailed up the large rivers into the heart
of the region which we now call France and captured and pillaged
cities and towns Some years after Charlemagne's death they went
as far as his capital Aix aks took the place and stabled
their horses in the cathedral which the great emperor had built

In the year 860 they discovered Iceland and made a settlement upon
its shores A few years later they sailed as far as Greenland and
there established settlements which existed for about a century

These Vikings were the first discoverers of the continent on which we
live Ancient books found in Iceland tell the story of the discovery
It is related that a Viking ship was driven during a storm to a
strange coast which is thought to have been that part of America
now known as Labrador

When the captain of the ship returned home he told what he had
seen His tale so excited the curiosity of a young Viking prince
called Leif the Lucky that he sailed to the newly discovered coast

Going ashore he found that the country abounded in wild grapes
and so he called it Vinland or the land of Vines Vinland is thought
to have been a part of what is now the Rhode Island coast

The Vikings were not aware that they had found a great unknown
continent No one in the more civilized parts of Europe knew anything
about their discovery and after a while the story of the Vinland
voyages seems to have been forgotten even among the Vikings themselves

So it is not to them that we owe the discovery of America but
to Columbus because his discovery though nearly five hundred
years later than that of the Norsemen actually made known to all
Europe for all time the existence of the New World

II

The Vikings had many able chieftains One of the most famous was
Rollo the Walker so called because he was such a giant that no
horse strong enough to carry him could be found and therefore
he always had to walk However he did on foot what few could do
on horseback

In 885 seven hundred ships commanded by Rollo and other Viking
chiefs left the harbors of Norway sailed to the mouth of the Seine
san and started up the river to capture the city of Paris

Rollo and his men stopped on the way at Rouen rö-onwhich
also was on the Seine but nearer its mouth The citizens had heard
of the giant and when they saw the river covered by his fleet they
were dismayed However the bishop of Rouen told them that Rollo
could be as noble and generous as he was fierce and he advised them
to open their gates and trust to the mercy of the Viking chief
This was done and Rollo marched into Rouen and took possession
of it The bishop had given good advice for Rollo treated the
people very kindly

Soon after capturing Rouen he left the place sailed up the river
to Paris and joined the other Viking chiefs And now for six long
miles the beautiful Seine was covered with Viking vessels which
carried an army of thirty thousand men

A noted warrior named Eudes ude was Count of Paris and he
had advised the Parisians to fortify the city So not long before
the arrival of Rollo and his companions two walls with strong
gates had been built round Paris

It was no easy task for even Vikings to capture a strongly walled
city We are told that Rollo and his men built a high tower and
rolled it on wheels up to the walls At its top was a floor well
manned with soldiers But the people within the city shot hundreds
of arrows at the besiegers and threw down rocks or poured boiling
oil and pitch upon them

The Vikings thought to starve the Parisians and for thirteen months
they encamped round the city At length food became very scarce
and Count Eudes determined to go for help He went out through one
of the gates on a dark stormy night and rode post-haste to the
king He told him that something must be done to save the people
of Paris

Illustration A VIKING SHIP

So the king gathered an army and marched to the city No battle
was fought the Vikings seemed to have been afraid to risk one
They gave up the siege and Paris was relieved

Rollo and his men went to the Duchy of Burgundy where as now
the finest crops were raised and the best of wines were made

III

Perhaps after a time Rollo and his Vikings went home but we do
not know what he did for about twenty-five years We do know that
he abandoned his old home in Norway in 911 Then he and his people
sailed from the icy shore of Norway and again went up the Seine
in hundreds of Viking vessels

Of course on arriving in the land of the Franks Rollo at once
began to plunder towns and farms

Charles then king of the Franks although his people called him
the Simple or Senseless had sense enough to see that this must
be stopped

So he sent a message to Rollo and proposed that they should have
a talk about peace Rollo agreed and accordingly they met The
king and his troops stood on one side of a little river and Rollo
with his Vikings stood on the other Messages passed between them
The king asked Rollo what he wanted

Let me and my people live in the land of the Franks let us make
ourselves home here and I and my Vikings will become your vassals
answered Rollo He asked for Rouen and the neighboring land So
the king gave him that part of Francia and ever since it has been
called Normandy the land of the Northmen

When it was decided that the Vikings should settle in Francia and
be subjects of the Frankish king Rollo was told that he must kiss
the foot of Charles in token that he would be the king's vassal
The haughty Viking refused Never said he will I bend my knee
before any man and no man's foot will I kiss After some persuasion
however he ordered one of his men to perform the act of homage
for him The king was on horseback and the Norseman standing by
the side of the horse suddenly seized the king's foot and drew
it up to his lips This almost made the king fall from his horse
to the great amusement of the Norsemen

Becoming a vassal to the king meant that if the king went to war
Rollo would be obliged to join his army and bring a certain number
of armed men one thousand or more

Rollo now granted parts of Normandy to his leading men on condition
that they would bring soldiers to his army and fight under him
They became his vassals as he was the king's vassal

The lands granted to vassals in this way were called feuds and
this plan of holding lands was called the Feudal System

It was established in every country of Europe during the Middle
Ages

The poorest people were called serfs They were almost slaves and
were never permitted to leave the estate to which they belonged
They did all the work They worked chiefly for the landlords but
partly for themselves

Having been a robber himself Rollo knew what a shocking thing it
was to ravage and plunder and he determined to change his people's
habits He made strict laws and hanged robbers His duchy thus
became one of the safest parts of Europe

The Northmen learned the language of the Franks and adopted their
religion

The story of Rollo is especially interesting to us because Rollo
was the forefather of that famous Duke of Normandy who less than
a hundred and fifty years later conquered England and brought
into that country the Norman nobles with their French language and
customs




ALFRED THE GREAT

KING FROM 871-901 AD

I

The Danes were neighbors of the Norwegian Vikings and like them
were fond of the sea and piracy They plundered the English coasts
for more than a century and most of northern and eastern England
became for a time a Danish country with Danish kings

What saved the rest of the country to the Saxons was the courage
of the great Saxon king Alfred

Alfred was the son of Ethelwulf king of the West Saxons He had
a loving mother who brought him up with great care Up to the age
of twelve it is said he was not able to read well in spite of
the efforts of his mother and others to teach him

When Alfred was a boy there were no printed books The wonderful
art of printing was not invented until about the year 1440 nearly
six hundred years later than Alfred's time Moreover the art of
making paper had not yet been invented Consequently the few books
in use in Alfred's time were written by skillful penmen who wrote
generally on leaves of parchment which was sheepskin carefully
prepared so that it might retain ink

One day Alfred's mother showed him and his elder brothers a beautiful
volume which contained a number of the best Saxon ballads Some of
the words in this book were written in brightly colored letters
and upon many of the leaves were painted pictures of gaily-dressed
knights and ladies

Oh what a lovely book exclaimed the boys

Yes it is lovely replied the mother I will give it to whichever
of you children can read it the best in a week

Alfred began at once to take lessons in reading and studied hard
day after day His brothers passed their time in amusements and
made fun of Alfred's efforts They thought he could not learn to
read as well as they could no matter how hard he should try

At the end of the week the boys read the book to their mother
one after the other Much to the surprise of his brothers Alfred
proved to be the best reader and his mother gave him the book

While still very young Alfred was sent by his father to Rome to
be anointed by His Holiness the Pope It was a long and tiresome
journey made mostly on horseback

With imposing solemn ceremony he was anointed by the Holy Father
Afterwards he spent a year in Rome receiving religious instruction

II

In the year 871 when Alfred was twenty-two years old the Danes
invaded various parts of England Some great battles were fought
and Alfred's elder brother Ethelred king of the West Saxons was
killed Thus Alfred became king

The Danes still continued to fight the Saxons and defeated Alfred
in a long and severe struggle They took for themselves the northern
and eastern parts of England

Moreover Danes from Denmark continued to cross the sea and ravage
the coast of Saxon England They kept the people in constant alarm
Alfred therefore determined to meet the pirates on their own element
the sea So he built and equipped the first English navy and in
875 gained the first naval victory ever won by the English

A few years after this however great numbers of Danes from the
northern part of England came pouring into the Saxon lands Alfred
himself was obliged to flee for his life

For many months he wandered through forests and over hills to avoid
being taken by the Danes He sometimes made his home in caves and
in the huts of shepherds and cowherds Often he tended the cattle
and sheep and was glad to get a part of the farmer's dinner in
pay for his services

Illustration INVASION OF ENGLAND BY THE DANES

Once when very hungry he went into the house of a cowherd and
asked for something to eat The cowherd's wife was baking cakes
and she said she would give him some when they were done

Watch the cakes and do not let them burn while I go across the
field to look after the cows said the woman as she hurried away
Alfred took his seat on the chimney-corner to do as he was told
But soon his thoughts turned to his troubles and he forgot about
the cakes

When the woman came back she cried out with vexation for the cakes
were burned and spoiled You lazy good-for-nothing man she
said I warrant you can eat cakes fast enough but you are too
lazy to help me bake them

With that she drove the poor hungry Alfred out of her house In
his ragged dress he certainly did not look like a king and she
had no idea that he was anything but a poor beggar

III

Some of Alfred's friends discovered where he was hiding and joined
him In a little time a body of soldiers came to him and a strong
fort was built by them From this fort Alfred and his men went
out now and then and gave battle to small parties of the Danes
Alfred was successful and his army grew larger and larger

One day he disguised himself as a wandering minstrel and went into
the camp of the Danes He strolled here and there playing on a
harp and singing Saxon ballads At last Guth'rum the commander
of the Danes ordered the minstrel to be brought to his tent

Alfred went Sing to me some of your charming songs said Guthrum
I never heard more beautiful music So the kingly harper played
and sang for the Dane and went away with handsome presents But
better than that he had gained information that was of the greatest
value

In a week he attacked the Danish forces and defeated them with
great slaughter in a battle which lasted all day and far into the
night Guthrum was taken prisoner and brought before Alfred

Taking his harp in his hands Alfred played and sang one of the
ballads with which he had entertained Guthrum in the camp The
Dane started in amazement and exclaimed

You then King Alfred were the wandering minstrel

Illustration ALFRED THE GREAT IN DANISH CAMP

Yes replied Alfred I was the musician whom you received so
kindly Your life is now in my hands but I will give you your
liberty if you will become a Christian and never again make war
on my people

King Alfred said Guthrum I will become a Christian and so
will all my men if you will grant liberty to them as to me and
henceforth we will be your friends

Alfred then released the Danes and they were baptized as Christians

An old road running across England from London to Chester was then
agreed upon as the boundary between the Danish and Saxon kingdoms
and the Danes settled in East Anglia as the eastern part of England
was called

Years of peace and prosperity followed for Alfred's kingdom During
these years the king rebuilt the towns that had been destroyed by
the Danes erected new forts and greatly strengthened his army
and navy

He also encouraged trade and he founded a school like that established
by Charlemagne He himself translated a number of Latin books into
Saxon and probably did more for the cause of education than any
other king that ever wore the English crown




HENRY THE FOWLER

KING FROM 919-936 AD

I

About a hundred years had passed since the death of Charlemagne
and his great empire had fallen to pieces Seven kings ruled where
he had once been sole emperor

West of the Rhine where the Germans lived the last descendant
of Charlemagne died when he was a mere boy The German nobles were
not willing for any foreign prince to govern them and yet they saw
that they must unite to defend their country against the invasions
of the barbarians called Magyars ma-järzSo they met and
elected Conrad duke of Franconia to be their king

However although he became king in name Conrad never had much
power over his nobles Some of them refused to recognize him as
king and his reign was disturbed by quarrels and wars He died
in 919 and on his death-bed he said to his brother Henry Duke
of Saxony is the ablest ruler in the empire Elect him king and
Germany will have peace

A few months after Conrad's death the nobles met at Aix-la-Chapelle
and elected Henry to be their king

At this time it was the custom in Europe to hunt various birds
such as the wild duck and partridge with falcons The falcons
were long-winged birds of prey resembling hawks They were trained
to perch on their master's wrist and wait patiently until they
were told to fly Then they would swiftly dart at their prey and
bear it to the ground Henry was very fond of falconry and hence
was known as Henry the Fowler or Falconer

As soon as the other dukes had elected him king a messenger was
sent to Saxony to inform him of the honor done him After a search
of some days he was at last found far up in the Hartz Mountains
hunting with his falcons Kneeling at his feet the messenger said

God save you Henry of Saxony I come to announce the death of
King Conrad and to tell you that the nobles have elected you to
succeed him as king of the Germans

For a moment the duke was speechless with amazement Then he exclaimed

Elected me king I cannot believe it I am a Saxon and King Conrad
was a Frank and a bitter enemy to me

Illustration THE CROWN OF GERMANY IS OFFERED TO HENRY THE FOWLER

It is true replied the messenger Conrad when dying advised
that the nobles should choose you as his successor

Henry was silent for while and then he said King Conrad was a
good man I know it now and I am sorry that I did not understand
him better when he was alive I accept the position offered to me
and I pray that I may be guided by Heaven in ruling his people

So Henry the Fowler left the chase to take up his duties as king
of the Germans

II

In proper time Henry was proclaimed king of Germany but he was
hardly seated on the throne when the country was invaded by thousands
of Magyars from the land which we now know as Hungary

As soon as possible Henry gathered an army and marched to meet
the barbarians He came upon a small force under the command of
the son of the Magyar king The Germans easily routed the Magyars
and took the king's son prisoner

This proved to be a very fortunate thing because it stopped the
war for a long term of years When the Magyar king learned that his
son was a prisoner in the hands of King Henry he was overwhelmed
with grief He mourned for his son day and night and at last sent
to the German camp a Magyar chief with a flag of truce to beg
that the prince might be given up

Our king says that he will give whatever you demand for the release
of his son said the chief to the German monarch

I will give up the prince on this condition only was the reply
the Magyars must leave the soil of Germany immediately and promise
not to war on us for nine years During those years I will pay to
the king yearly five thousand pieces of gold

I accept the terms in the king's name responded the chief The
prince was therefore given up and the Magyars withdrew

During the nine years of truce King Henry paid great attention
to the organization of an army Before this the German soldiers
had fought chiefly on foot not as the Magyars did on horseback
For this reason they were at a great disadvantage in battle The
king now raised a strong force of horsemen and had them drilled
so thoroughly that they became almost invincible The infantry
also were carefully drilled

Besides this Henry built a number of forts in different parts of
his kingdom and had all the fortified cities made stronger

The following year the Magyar chief appeared at the German court
and demanded a tenth payment

Not a piece of gold will be given you replied King Henry Our
truce is ended

In less than a week a vast body of Magyars entered Germany to renew
the war Henry held his army in waiting until lack of food compelled
the barbarians to divide their forces into two separate bodies
One division was sent to one part of the country the other to
another part

Henry completely routed both divisions and the power of the Magyars
in Germany was broken

The Danes also invaded Henry's kingdom but he defeated them and
drove them back

Henry reigned for eighteen years and when he died all Germany was
peaceful and prosperous His son Otto succeeded him He assumed
the title of Emperor which Charlemagne had borne more than a
hundred years before

From that time on for nearly one thousand years all the German
emperors claimed to be the successors of Charlemagne They called
their domain the Holy Roman Empire and took the title Emperor
or Emperor of the Romans until the year 1806 when Francis II
resigned it




CANUTE THE GREAT

KING FROM 1014-1035

I

The Danes you remember had the eastern and northern parts of
England in the time of Alfred Alfred's successors drove them farther
and farther north and at length the Danish kingdom in England
came to an end for a time

But the Danes in Denmark did not forget that there had been such
a kingdom and in the year 1013 Sweyn swane King of Denmark
invaded England and defeated the Anglo-Saxons Ethelred their
king fled to Normandy

Sweyn now called himself the king of England but in a short time
he died and his son Canute succeeded to his throne Canute was
nineteen years old He had been his father's companion during the
war with the Anglo-Saxons and thus had had a good deal of experience
as a soldier

After the death of Sweyn some of the Anglo-Saxons recalled King
Ethelred and revolted against the Danes

Canute however went to Denmark and there raised one of the largest
armies of Danes that had ever been assembled With this powerful
force he sailed to England When he landed Northumberland and Wessex
acknowledged him as king Shortly after this Ethelred died

Canute now thought he would find it easy to get possession of all
England This was a mistake

Ethelred left a son named Edmund Ironside who was a very brave
soldier He became by his father's death the king of Saxon England
and at once raised an army to defend his kingdom A battle was fought
and Edmund was victorious This was the first of five battles that
were fought in one year In none of them could the Danes do more
than gain a slight advantage now and then

However the Saxons were at last defeated in a sixth battle through
the act of a traitor Edric a Saxon noble took his men out of
the fight and his treachery so weakened the Saxon army that Edmund
Ironside had to surrender to Canute

But the young Dane had greatly admired Edmund for the way in which he
had fought against heavy odds so he now treated him most generously
Canute took certain portions of England and the remainder was given
to Edmund Ironside

Thus for a short time the Anglo-Saxon people had at once a Danish
and a Saxon monarch

Illustration DANES EMBARKING FOR THE INVASION OF ENGLAND

II

Edmund died in 1016 and after his death Canute became sole ruler

He ruled wisely He determined to make his Anglo-Saxon subjects
forget that he was a foreign conqueror To show his confidence
in them he sent back to Denmark the army he had brought over the
sea keeping on a part of his fleet and a small body of soldiers
to act as guards at his palace

He now depended on the support of his Anglo-Saxon subjects and he
won their love

Although a king and it is generally believed that kings like
flattery Canute is said to have rebuked his courtiers when they
flattered him On one occasion when they were talking about his
achievements one of them said to him

Most noble king I believe you can do anything

Canute sternly rebuked the courtier for these words and then said

Come with me gentlemen

He led them from the palace grounds to the sea-shore where the
tide was rising and had his chair placed at the edge of the water

You say I can do anything he said to the courtiers Very well
I who am king and the lord of the ocean now command these rising
waters to go back and not dare wet my feet

Illustration CANUTE REBUKES HIS COURTIERS

But the tide was disobedient and steadily rose and rose until
the feet of the king were in the water Turning to his courtiers
Canute said

Learn how feeble is the power of earthly kings None is worthy
the name of king but He whom heaven and earth and sea obey

During Canute's reign England had peace and prosperity and the
English people have ever held his memory dear




THE CID

Late one sunny afternoon one and twenty knights were riding along
the highway in the northern part of Spain As they were passing
a deep mire they heard cries for help and turning saw a poor
leper who was sinking in the mud One of the knights a handsome
young man was touched by the cries He dismounted rescued the
poor fellow took him upon his own horse and thus the two rode
to the inn The other knights wondered at this

When they reached the inn where they were to stop for the night
they wondered still more for their companion gave the leper a
seat next to himself at the table After supper the knight shared
his own bed with the leper If the knight had not done this the
leper would have been driven out of the town with nothing to eat
and no place in which to sleep At midnight while the young man
was fast asleep the leper breathed upon his back This awakened
the knight who turned quickly in his bed and found that the leper
was gone

The knight called for a light and searched but in vain While he
was wondering about what had happened a man in shining garments
appeared before him and said Rodrigo art thou asleep or awake
The knight answered I am awake but who art thou that bringest
such brightness The vision replied I am St Lazarus the leper
to whom thou wast so kind Because I have breathed upon thee thou
shalt accomplish whatever thou shalt undertake in peace or in battle
All shall honor thee Therefore go on and evermore do good

With that the vision vanished

The promise of St Lazarus was fulfilled In time young Rodrigo became
the great hero of Spain The Spaniards called him Cam-pe-ä-doror
Champion The Saracens called him The Cid or Lord His real
name was Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar but he is usually spoken of as
The Cid

The Goths after the death of Alaric had taken Spain away from
the Romans The Saracens or as they were usually called the
Moors had crossed the sea from Africa and in turn had taken Spain
from the Goths In the time of Charles Martel the Goths had lost
all Spain except the small mountain district in the northern part
In the time of the Cid the Goths now called Spaniards had driven
the Moors down to about the middle of Spain War went on all the time
between the two races and many men spent their lives in fighting
The Spanish part of the country then comprised the kingdoms of
Castile Leon Aragon and others

Illustration THE GATE OF THE SUN AT TOLEDO

The Cid was a subject of Fernando of Castile Fernando had a dispute
with the king of Aragon about a city which each claimed They agreed
to decide the matter by a combat Each was to choose a champion
The champions were to fight and the king whose champion won was
to have the city Fernando chose the Cid and though the other
champion was called the bravest knight in Spain the youthful warrior
vanquished him

When Alfonzo a son of Fernando succeeded to the throne he became
angry with the Cid without just cause and banished him from Christian
Spain

The Cid was in need of some money so he filled two chests with
sand and sent word to two wealthy money lenders that he wished
to borrow six hundred Spanish marks about $2000 and would put
into their hands his treasures of silver and gold which were packed
in two chests but the money lenders must solemnly swear not to
open the chests until a full year had passed To this they gladly
agreed They took the chests and loaned him six hundred marks

The Cid was now ready for his journey Three hundred of his knights
went into banishment with him They crossed the mountains and entered
the land of the Moors Soon they reached the town of Alcocer and
after a siege captured it and lived in it

Then the Moorish king of Valencia ordered two chiefs to take three
thousand horsemen recapture the town and bring the Cid alive to
him

So the Cid and his men were shut up in Alcocer and besieged Famine
threatened them and they determined to cut their way through the
army of the Moors Suddenly and swiftly they poured from the gate
of Alcocer and a terrible battle was fought The two Moorish chiefs
were taken prisoners and thirteen hundred of their men were killed
in the battle The Cid then became a vassal of the Moorish king
of Saragossa

After a while Alfonzo recalled the Cid from banishment and gave
him seven castles and the lands adjoining them He needed the Cid's
help in the greatest of all his plans against the Moors He was
determined to capture Toledo He attacked it with a large army
in which there were soldiers from many foreign lands The Cid is
said to have been the commander After a long siege the city fell
and the victorious army marched across the great bridge built by
the Moors which you would cross to-day if you went to Toledo

Valencia was one of the largest and richest cities in Moorish Spain
It was strongly fortified but the Cid determined to attack it

The plain about the city was irrigated by streams that came down
from the neighboring hills To prevent the Cid's army from coming
near the city the Saracens flooded the plain But the Cid camped
on high ground above the plain and from that point besieged the
city Food became very scarce in Valencia Wheat barley and cheese
were all so dear that none but the rich could buy them People ate
horses dogs cats and mice until in the whole city only three
horses and a mule were left alive

Then on the fifteenth of June 1094 the governor went to the camp
of the Cid and delivered to him the keys of the city The Cid placed
his men in all the forts and took the citadel as his own dwelling
His banner floated from the towers He called himself the Prince
of Valencia

Illustration BRIDGE AT TOLEDO

When the king of Morocco heard of this he raised an army of fifty
thousand men They crossed from Africa to Spain and laid siege to
Valencia But the Cid with his men made a sudden sally and routed
them and pursued them for miles It is said that fifteen thousand
soldiers were drowned in the river Gua-dal-qui-virwhich they
tried to cross

The Cid was now at the height of his power and lived in great
magnificence One of the first things he did was to repay the two
friends who had lent him the six hundred marks He was kind and
just to the Saracens who had become his subjects They were allowed
to have their mosques and to worship God as they thought right

In time the Cid's health began to fail He could lead his men forth
to battle no more He sent an army against the Moors but it was so
completely routed that few of his men came back to tell the tale
It is said by a Moorish writer that when the runaways reached
him the Cid died of rage 1099

There is a legend that shortly before he died he saw a vision of
St Peter who told him that he should gain a victory over the
Saracens after his death

So the Cid gave orders that his body should be embalmed It was
so well preserved that it seemed alive It was clothed in a coat
of mail and the sword that had won so many battles was placed in
the hand Then it was mounted upon the Cid's favorite horse and
fastened into the saddle and at midnight was borne out of the
gate of Valencia with a guard of a thousand knights

All silently they marched to a spot where the Moorish king with
thirty-six chieftains lay encamped and at daylight the knights
of the Cid made a sudden attack The king awoke It seemed to him
that there were coming against him full seventy thousand knights
all dressed in robes as white as snow and before them rode a knight
taller than all the rest holding in his left hand a snow-white
banner and in the other a sword which seemed of fire So afraid
were the Moorish chief and his men that they fled to the sea and
twenty thousand of them were drowned as they tried to reach their
ships

There is a Latin inscription near the tomb of the Cid which may
be translated

Brave and unconquered famous in triumphs of war
Enclosed in this tomb lies Roderick the Great of Bivar




EDWARD THE CONFESSOR

KING FROM 1042-1066

I

The Danish kings who followed Canute were not like him They were
cruel unjust rulers and all the people of England hated them
So when in the year 1042 the last of them died Edward the son
of the Saxon Ethelred was elected king

He is known in history as Edward the Confessor He was a man of
holy life and after his death was made a saint by the Church with
the title of the Confessor Though born in England he passed the
greater part of his life in Normandy as an exile from his native
land He was thirty-eight years old when he returned from Normandy
to become king

As he had lived so long in Normandy he always seemed more like a
Norman than one of English birth He generally spoke the French
language and he chose Normans to fill many of the highest offices
in his kingdom

For the first eight years of his reign there was perfect peace
in his kingdom except in the counties of Kent and Essex where
pirates from the North Sea made occasional attacks

Illustration NORWEGIAN PIRATES ON THE COAST OF KENT

These pirates were mostly Norwegians whose leader was a barbarian
named Kerdric They would come sweeping down upon the Kentish coast
in many ships make a landing where there were no soldiers and
fall upon the towns and plunder them Then as swiftly and suddenly
as they had come they would sail away homeward before they could
be captured

One day Kerdic's fleet arrived off the coast and as no opposing
force was visible the pirates landed and started toward the nearest
town to plunder it

By a quick march a body of English soldiers reached the town before
the pirates and when the latter arrived they found a strong force
drawn up to give them battle A short struggle took place More
than half of the pirates were slain and the remainder were taken
prisoners

After the prisoners had been secured the English ships that were
stationed on the coast attacked the pirate fleet and destroyed
it

Edward took part in the events upon which Shakespeare five hundred
years later founded his famous tragedy of Macbeth

There lived in Scotland during his reign an ambitious nobleman
named Macbeth who invited Duncan the King of Scotland to his
castle and murdered him He tried to make it appear that the murder
had been committed by Duncan's attendants and he caused the king's
son and heir Prince Malcolm to flee from the land He then made
himself king of Scotland

Malcolm hastened to England and appealed to King Edward for help

When the king was told the number of soldiers Malcolm would probably
need he gave orders for double that number to march into Scotland
Malcolm with this support attacked Macbeth and after several
well-fought battles drove the usurper from Scotland and took possession
of the throne

Edward did a great deal during his reign to aid the cause of
Christianity He rebuilt the ancient Westminster Abbey in London
and erected churches and monasteries in different parts of England

Edward was long supposed to have made many just laws and years after
his death the English people when suffering from bad government
would exclaim Oh for the good laws and customs of Edward the
Confessor What he really did was to have the old laws faithfully
carried out

He died in 1066 and was buried in Westminster Abbey




WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR

KING FROM 1066-1087

I

On the death of Edward the Confessor the throne of England was claimed
by William Duke of Normandy

When Edward took refuge in Normandy after the Danes conquered England
he stayed at the palace of William He was very kindly treated
there and William said that Edward had promised in gratitude that
William should succeed him as king of England

One day in the year 1066 when William was hunting with a party of
his courtiers in the woods near Rouen a noble came riding rapidly
toward him shouting Your Highness a messenger has just arrived
from England bearing the news that King Edward is dead and that
Harold the son of Earl Godwin has been placed on the English
throne

William at once called his nobles together and said to them I
must have your consent that I enforce my claim to England's throne
by arms

Illustration HAROLD RECEIVING NEWS OF THE NORMAN INVASION

The barons gave their consent So an army of sixty thousand men
was collected and a large fleet of ships was built to carry this
force across the channel

During the months of preparation William sent an embassy to the
English court to demand of Harold that he give up the throne Harold
refused

Soon all England was startled by the news that William had landed
on the English coast at the port of Hastings with a large force

Harold immediately marched as quickly as possible from the north
to the southern coast In a week or so he arrived at a place called
Senlac nine miles from Hastings in the neighborhood of which town
the Norman army was encamped He took his position on a low range
of hills and awaited the attack of William His men were tired
with their march but he encouraged them and bade them prepare for
battle

On the morning of October 14 1066 the two armies met The Norman
foot-soldiers opened the battle by charging on the English stockades
They ran over the plain to the low hills singing a war-song at
the top of their voices but they could not carry the stockades
although they tried again and again They therefore attacked another
part of the English forces

William clad in complete armor was in the very front of the fight
urging on his troops At one time a cry arose in his army that he
was slain and a panic began William drew off his helmet and rode
along the lines shouting I live I live Fight on We shall
conquer yet

The battle raged from morning till night Harold himself fought
on foot at the head of his army and behaved most valiantly His
men tired as they were from their forced march bravely struggled
on hour after hour

But at last William turned their lines and threw them into confusion
As the sun went down Harold was killed and his men gave up the
fight

From Hastings William marched toward London On the way he received
the surrender of some towns and burned others that would not surrender
London submitted and some of the nobles and citizens came forth
and offered the English crown to the Norman duke

On the 25th of December 1066 the Conqueror as he is always
called was crowned in Westminster Abbey by Archbishop Ealdred
Both English and Norman people were present When the question was
asked by the Archbishop Will you have William Duke of Normandy
for your king all present answered We will

II

At first William ruled England with moderation The laws and customs
were not changed and in a few months after the battle of Hastings
the kingdom was so peaceful that William left it in charge of his
brother and went to Normandy for a visit

While he was gone many of the English nobles rebelled against him
and on his return he made very severe laws and did some very harsh
things He laid waste an extensive territory destroying all the
houses upon it and causing thousands of persons to die from lack of
food and shelter because the people there had not sworn allegiance
to him

He made a law that all lights should be put out and fires covered
with ashes at eight o'clock every evening so that the people would
have to go to bed then A bell was rung in all cities and towns
throughout England to warn the people of the hour The bell was
called the curfew from the French words couvre feu meaning
to cover fire

To find out about the lands of England and their owners so that
everybody might be made to pay taxes he appointed officers in
all the towns to report what estates there were who owned them
and what they were worth The reports were copied into two volumes
called the Domesday Book This book showed that England at that
time had a population of a little more than a million

Illustration DEATH OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR

William made war on Scotland and conquered it During a war with
the king of France the city of Mantes mont was burned by William's
soldiers As William rode over the ruins his horse stumbled and the
king was thrown to the ground and injured He was borne to Rouen
where he lay ill for six weeks His sons and even his attendants
abandoned him in his last hours It is said that in his death struggle
he fell from his bed to the floor where his body was found by his
servants




PETER THE HERMIT

ABOUT 1050-1115

I

During the Middle Ages the Christians of Europe used to go to the
Holy Land for the purpose of visiting the tomb of Christ and other
sacred places Those who made such a journey were called pilgrims

Every year thousands of pilgrims kings nobles and people of humbler
rank went to the Holy Land

While Jerusalem was in the hands of the Arabian caliphs who reigned
at Bagdad the Christian pilgrims were generally well treated After
about 1070 when the Turks took possession of the city outrages
became so frequent that it seemed as if it would not be safe for
Christians to visit the Savior's tomb at all

About the year 1095 there lived at Amiens ä-me-anFrance a
monk named Peter the Hermit

Peter was present at a council of clergy and people held at Clermont
in France when his Holiness Pope Urban II made a stirring speech
He begged the people to rescue the Holy Sepulchre and other sacred
sites from the Mohammedans

The council was so roused by his words that they broke forth into
loud cries God wills it God wills it

It is indeed His will said the Pope and let these words be
your war-cry when you meet the enemy

Peter listened with deep attention Immediately after the council
he began to preach in favor of a war against the Turks With head
and feet bare and clothed in a long coarse robe tied at the waist
with a rope he went through Italy from city to city riding on
a donkey He preached in churches on the streets wherever he
could secure an audience

When Peter had gone over Italy he crossed the Alps and preached to
the people of France Germany and neighboring countries Everywhere
he kindled the zeal of the people and multitudes enlisted as champions
of the cross

Thus began the first of seven wars known as the Crusades or Wars
of the Cross waged to rescue the Holy Land from the Mohammedans

It is said that more than 100000 men women and children went
on the first Crusade Each wore on the right shoulder the emblem
of the cross

Illustration PETER THE HERMIT PREACHING THE FIRST CRUSADE

Peter was in command of one portion of this great multitude His
followers began their journey with shouts of joy and praise

But they had no proper supply of provisions So when passing through
Hungary they plundered the towns and compelled the inhabitants to
support them This roused the anger of the Hungarians They attacked
the Crusaders and killed a great many of them

After long delays about seven thousand of those who had started on
the Crusade reached Constantinople They were still enthusiastic
and sounded their war-cry God wills it with as much fervor as
when they first joined Peter's standard

Leaving Constantinople they went eastward into the land of the
Turks A powerful army led by the sultan met them The Crusaders
fought heroically all day long but at length were badly beaten
Only a few escaped and found their way back to Constantinople

Peter the Hermit had left the Crusaders before the battle and returned
to Constantinople He afterwards joined the army of Godfrey of
Bouillon

Godfrey's army was composed of six divisions each commanded by
a soldier of high rank and distinction It was a well organized
and disciplined force and numbered about half a million men

It started only a few weeks after the irregular multitude which
followed Peter the Hermit and was really the first Crusading army
for Peter's undisciplined throng could hardly be called an army

After a long march Godfrey reached Antioch and laid siege to it

It was believed that this Moslem stronghold could be taken in a
short time but the city resisted the attacks of the Christians
for seven months Then it surrendered

And now something happened that none of the Crusaders had dreamed
of An army of two hundred thousand Persians arrived to help the
Moslems They laid siege to Antioch and shut up the Crusaders within
its walls for weeks However after a number of engagements in
which there was great loss of life the Turks and Persians were
at last driven away

The way was now opened to Jerusalem But out of the half million
Crusaders who had marched from Europe less than fifty thousand
were left They had won their way at a fearful cost

Still onward they pushed with brave hearts until on a bright summer
morning they caught the first glimpse of the Holy City in the distance
For two whole years they had toiled and suffered in the hope of
reaching Jerusalem Now it lay before them

Illustration ENTRY OF THE CRUSADERS INTO JERUSALEM

But it had yet to be taken For more than five weeks the Crusaders
carried on the siege Finally on the 15th of July 1099 the Turks
surrendered The Moslem flag was hauled down and the banner of
the cross floated over the Holy City

A few days after the Christians had occupied Jerusalem Godfrey of
Bouillon was chosen king of the Holy Land

I will accept the office he said but no crown must be put
on my head and I must never be called king I cannot wear a crown
of gold where Christ wore one of thorns nor will I be called king
in the land where once lived the King of Kings

Peter the Hermit is said to have preached an eloquent sermon on
the Mount of Olives He did not however remain long in Jerusalem
but after the capture of the city returned to Europe He founded
a monastery in France and within its walls passed the rest of his
life




FREDERICK BARBAROSSA

EMPEROR FROM 1152-1190

I

Frederick I was one of the most famous of German emperors He was
a tall stalwart man of majestic appearance He had a long red
beard and so the people called him Barbarossa or Red-Beard He
came to the throne in 1152

At that time the province of Lombardy in northern Italy was a part
of the German empire

In 1158 Milan mï-lanthe chief city of Lombardy revolted
Then over the Alps came an army of a hundred thousand German soldiers
with Frederick at their head After a long siege the city surrendered

But soon it revolted again The emperor besieged it once more and
once more it surrendered Its fortifications were destroyed and
many of its buildings ruined

But even then the spirit of the Lombards was not broken Milan
and the other cities of Lombardy united in a league and defied
the emperor He called upon the German dukes to bring their men
to his aid All responded except Henry the Lion duke of Saxony
Frederick's cousin whom he had made duke of Bavaria also Frederick
is said to have knelt and implored Henry to do his duty but in
vain

Illustration FREDERICK AT THE FEET OF HENRY THE LION

In his campaign against the Lombards Frederick was unsuccessful
His army was completely defeated and he was compelled to grant
freedom to the cities of Lombardy Everybody blamed Henry the Lion
The other dukes charged him with treason and he was summoned to
appear before a meeting of the nobles He failed to come and the
nobles thereupon declared him guilty and took from him everything
that he had except the lands he had inherited from his father

Frederick now devoted himself to making Germany a united nation
Two of his nobles had been quarreling for a long time and as a
punishment for their conduct each was condemned with ten of his
counts and barons to carry dogs on his shoulders from one country
to another

Frederick finally succeeded in keeping the nobles in the different
provinces of Germany at peace with one another and persuaded them
to work together for the good of the whole empire He had no more
trouble with them and for many years his reign was peaceful and
prosperous

II

After the Christians had held Jerusalem for eighty-eight years it
was recaptured by the Moslems under the lead of the famous Sal'a-din
in the year 1187 There was much excitement in Christendom and the
Pope proclaimed another Crusade

Frederick immediately raised an army of Crusaders in the German
Empire and with one hundred and fifty thousand men started for
Palestine

He marched into Asia Minor attacked the Moslem forces and defeated
them in two great battles

But before the brave old warrior reached the Holy Land his career
was suddenly brought to an end One day his army was crossing a
small bridge over a river in Asia Minor At a moment when the bridge
was crowded with troops Frederick rode up rapidly

Illustration NOBLES CARYING DOGS

He was impatient to join his son who was leading the advance guard
and when he found that he could not cross immediately by the bridge
he plunged into the river to swim his horse across Both horse and
rider were swept away by the current Barbarossa's heavy armor
made him helpless and he was drowned His body was recovered and
buried at Antioch

Barbarossa was so much loved by his people that it was said Germany
and Frederick Barbarossa are one in the hearts of the Germans
His death caused the greatest grief among the German Crusaders
They had now little heart to fight the infidels and most of them
at once returned to Germany

In the Empire the dead hero was long mourned and for many years
the peasants believed that Frederick was not really dead but was
asleep in a cave in the mountains of Germany with his gallant
knights around him He was supposed to be sitting in his chair
of state with the crown upon his head his eyes half-closed in
slumber his beard as white as snow and so long that it reached
the ground

When the ravens cease to fly round the mountain said the legend
Barbarossa shall awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness




HENRY THE SECOND 1154-1189

AND

HIS SONS 1189-1216

I

In 1154 while Barbarossa was reigning in Germany Henry II one
of England's greatest monarchs came to the throne

Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plan-tag'e-net Count of Anjou in
France and Matilda daughter of King Henry I and granddaughter of
William the Conqueror Count Geoffrey used to wear in his hat a sprig
of the broom plant which is called in Latin planta genista From
this he adopted the name Plantagenet and the kings who descended
from him and ruled England for more than three hundred years are
called the Plantagenets

Henry II inherited a vast domain in France and managing this in
addition England kept him very busy One who knew him well said
He never sits down he is on his feet from morning till night

His chief assistant in the management of public affairs was Thomas
Becket whom he made chancellor of the kingdom Becket was fond
of pomp and luxury and lived in a more magnificent manner than
even the king himself

The clergy had at this time become almost independent of the king
To bring them under his authority Henry made Becket Archbishop of
Canterbury thus putting him at the head of the Church in England
The king expected that Becket would carry out all his wishes

Becket however refused to do that which the king most desired
and a quarrel arose between them At last to escape the king's
anger Becket fled to France and remained there for six years

At the end of this time Henry invited him to come back to England
Not long after however the old quarrel began again One day while
Henry was sojourning in France he cried out in a moment of passion
while surrounded by a group of knights Is there no one who will
rid me of this turbulent priest

Four knights who heard him understood from this angry speech that
he desired the death of Becket and they went to England to murder
the Archbishop When they met Becket they first demanded that he
should do as the king wished but he firmly refused At dusk that
same day they entered Canterbury Cathedral again seeking for him
Where is the traitor Thomas Becket one of them cried

Becket boldly answered Here am I no traitor but a priest of
god

As he finished speaking the knights rushed upon him and killed him

Illustration THE MURDERED ARCHBISHOP

The people of England were horrified by this brutal murder Becket
was called a martyr and his tomb became a place of pious pilgrimage
The Pope canonized him and for years he was the most venerated of
English saints

King Henry was in Normandy when the murder occurred He declared
that he had had nothing whatever to do with it and he punished
the murderers

But from this time Henry had many troubles His own sons rebelled
against him his barons were unfriendly and conspiracies were
formed Henry thought that God was punishing him for the murder of
Becket and so determined to do penance at the tomb of the saint

For some distance before he reached Canterbury Cathedral where
Becket was buried he walked over the road with bare head and feet
After his arrival he fasted and prayed a day and a night The next
day he put scourges into the hands of the cathedral monks and said
Scourge me as I kneel at the tomb of the saint The monks did
as he bade them and he patiently bore the pain

Henry finally triumphed over his enemies and had some years of peace
which he devoted to the good of England

In the last year of his life however he had trouble again The
king of France and Henry's son Richard took up arms against him
Henry was defeated and was forced to grant what they wished When
he saw a list of the barons who had joined the French king he found
among them the name of his favorite son John and his heart was
broken He died a few days later

II

Henry's eldest surviving son Richard was crowned at Westminster
Abbey in 1190 He took the title of Richard I but is better known
as Coeur de Lion the lion-hearted a name which was given
him on account of his bravery He had wonderful strength and his
brave deeds were talked about all over the land

With such a man for their king the English people became devoted
to chivalry and on every field of battle brave men vied with another
in brave deeds Knighthood was often the reward of valor Then as
now knighthood was usually conferred upon a man by his king or
queen A part of the ceremony consisted in the sovereign's touching
the kneeling subject's soldier with the flat of a sword and saying
Arise Sir Knight This was called the accolade

Richard did not stay long in England after his coronation In 1191
he went with Philip of France on a Crusade

The French and English Crusaders together numbered more than one
hundred thousand men They sailed to the Holy Land and joined an
army of Christian soldiers encamped before the city of Acre The
besiegers had despaired of taking the city but when reinforced
they gained fresh courage

Illustration THE ACCOLADE

Coeur de Lion now performed deeds of valor which gave him fame
throughout Europe He was the terror of the Saracens In every
attack on Acre he led the Christians and when the city was captured
he planted his banner in triumph on its walls

So great was the terror inspired everywhere in the Holy Land by
the name of Richard that Moslem mothers are said to have made their
children quiet by threatening to send for the English king

Every night when the Crusaders encamped the heralds blew their
trumpets and cried three times Save the Holy Sepulchre And
the Crusaders knelt and said Amen

The great leader of the Saracens was Saladin He was a model of
heroism and the two leaders one the champion of the Christians
and the other the champion of the Mohammedans vied with each other
in knightly deeds

Just before one battle Richard rode down the Saracen line and boldly
called for any one to step forth and fight him alone No one responded
to the challenge for the most valiant of the Saracens did not dare
to meet the lion-hearted king

After the capture of Acre Richard took As'ca-lon Then he made a
truce with Saladin by which the Christians acquired the right for
three years to visit the Holy City without paying for the privilege

Illustration RICHARD COEUR DE LION AND SALADIN RULER OF THE
FAITHFUL ENTERING JERUSALEM

III

Richard now set out on his voyage home He was wrecked however
on the Adriatic Sea near Trieste To get to England he was obliged
to go through the lands of Leopold duke of Austria one of his
bitterest enemies So he disguised himself as a poor pilgrim returning
from the Holy Land

But he was recognized by a costly ring that he wore and was taken
prisoner at Vienna by Duke Leopold His people in England anxiously
awaited his return and when after a long time he did not appear
they were sadly distressed There is a legend that a faithful squire
named Blondel went in search of him as a wandering minstrel traveled
for months over central Europe vainly seeking for news of his
master

At last one day while singing one of Richard's favorite songs
near the walls of the castle where the king was confined he heard
the song repeated from a window He recognized the voice of Richard
From the window Richard told him to let the English people and
the people of Europe know where he was confined and the minstrel
immediately went upon his mission

Soon Europe was astounded to learn that brave Richard of England
the great champion of Christendom was imprisoned The story of
Blondel is probably not true but what is true is that England
offered to ransom Richard that the Pope interceded for him and
that finally it was agreed that he should be given up on the payment
of a very large sum of money The English people quickly paid the
ransom and Richard was freed

The king of France had little love for Richard and Richard's own
brother John had less Both were sorry that Coeur de Lion was
at liberty

John had taken charge of the kingdom during his brother's absence
and hoped that Richard might pass the rest of his days in the prison
castle of Leopold

As soon as Richard was released the French king sent word to John
The devil is loose again And a very disappointed man was John
when all England rang with rejoicing at Richard's return

IV

Upon the death of Richard in 1199 Arthur the son of his elder
brother Geoffrey was the rightful heir to the throne John however
seized the throne himself and cast Arthur into prison There is a
legend that he ordered Arthur's eyes to be put out with red hot
irons The jailor however was touched by the boy's prayer for
mercy and spared him But Arthur was not to escape his uncle long
It is said that one night the king took him out upon the Seine in
a little boat murdered him and cast his body into the river

Illustration PRINCE ARTHUR PLEADS WITH HIS JAILER

Besides being a king of England John was duke of Normandy and
Philip king of France now summoned him to France to answer for
the crime of murdering Arthur John would not answer the summons
and this gave the king of France an excuse for taking possession of
Normandy He did so and thus this great province was lost forever
to England Nothing in France was left to John except A-qui-taine'
which had come to him through his mother

John's government was unjust and tyrannical and the bishops and
barons determined to preserve their rights and the rights of the
people They met on a plain called Runnymeade and there forced
John to sign the famous Magna Carta Great Charter

Magna Carta is the most valuable charter ever granted by any sovereign
to his people In it King John names all the rights which belong
to the citizens under a just government and he promises that no
one of these rights shall ever be taken away from any subjects
of the English king For violating this promise one English king
lost his life and another lost the American colonies

Magna Carta was signed in 1215 A year after he signed it the king
died His son Henry III succeeded him

LOUIS THE NINTH

KING FROM 1226-1270

I

After the time of Barbarossa and Richard Coeur de Lion lived
another great Crusading king This was a grandson of Philip II
named Louis IX who became sovereign of France in 1226 He was
then only eleven years old so for some years his mother ruled the
kingdom

A few years after he had begun to reign Louis decided to make his
brother Alphonse the governor of a certain part of France The
nobles of the region refused to have Alphonse as governor and invited
Henry III of England to help them in a revolt

Henry crossed to France with an army to support the rebellious
nobles He was duke of Aquitaine and Gascony so that although he
was the king in England he had to do homage to the king of France
for his possessions in that country and fight for him if called
upon to do so

Louis gathered an army and hastened to meet the English troops
He drove Henry from place to place until at last he forced him
to make terms of peace The rebellious nobles who had invited the
English king to France soon after swore allegiance to Louis and
afterwards he had little trouble in his kingdom

Illustration THE CHILD KING LOUIS THE NINTH BESTOWING ALMS

Once Louis was dangerously ill and his life was despaired of Finally
he was believed to be dying and his wife and chief officials gathered
round his bed to await the end Suddenly he roused himself and
said in a feeble voice The cross The cross

They laid the cross upon his heart and he clasped it fervently
For a while he slumbered When he awoke he appeared much better
In a day or two he was entirely well He then made a solemn vow
that in thankfulness for his restoration he would go on a Crusade
to the Holy Land

Louis lived at a time when everybody was full of the Crusading
spirit A few years before he was born even the children in France
and Germany started out upon a Crusade of their own It is called
in history the Children's Crusade Several thousand left their
homes and marched toward the Mediterranean They thought that God
would open a pathway to the Holy Land for them through its waters
A number of them died of cold and hunger when trying to cross the
Alps Some reached Rome and when the Pope saw them he told them
to return home and not think of going on a Crusade until they were
grown up

Illustration THE CHILDREN'S CRUSADE

It is easy to understand how in such an age people flocked to Louis'
banner when he asked for volunteers to go with him on another Crusade

In a few months forty thousand Crusaders assembled at a French
port on the Mediterranean Sea On a bright day in August 1248
they went on board the fleet which was ready to sail The king
called to the Crusaders Sing in the name of God Shout forth
his praises as we sail away Then quickly on ship after ship
shouts of praise burst from the lips of thousands and amid the
grand chorus the fleet began its voyage

The Crusaders went to Dam-i-et'ta in Egypt Louis was so eager to
land that he jumped into water up to his waist and waded ashore
He captured the city without striking a blow

He had resolved to make war on the Moslems in Egypt rather than
in the Holy Land so when he left Damietta he marched southward

He supposed there would be no strong force to stop his progress
However he was mistaken for he had not marched forty miles toward
Cairo when he was attacked by a Moslem army led by the sultan of
Egypt

A great battle was fought The Crusaders were commanded by King
Louis and throughout the battle showed the utmost bravery but they
were outnumbered Thousands were slain and the survivors retreated
toward Damietta

The Moslems pursued them and the Crusaders were obliged to surrender
Out of the forty thousand men who had left France only about six
thousand now remained Many had died of disease as well as in battle

King Louis was among the prisoners and the sultan of Egypt agreed
to release him only upon the payment of a large ransom

When the ransom had been paid a truce was made for ten years between
Louis and the sultan and the good king left Egypt He then went
to the Holy Land and for four years worked to deliver Crusaders
who were in Moslem prisons

II

During the time that Louis was in the Holy Land his mother ruled
France as regent When she died he returned immediately to his
kingdom and devoted himself to governing it

In 1252 he took part in the founding of the Sorbonne the most
famous theological college of Europe from the days of St Louis
down to the time of the French Revolution

Illustration THE FOUNDING OF THE SORBONNE

He ruled his people so wisely and justly that it is hard to find
any better king or even one equally as good in the whole line of
French kings He never wronged any man himself or knowingly allowed
any man to be wronged by others

Near his palace there was a grand oak with wide-spreading branches
under which he used to sit on pleasant days in summer There he
received all persons who had complaints to make rich and poor
alike Every one who came was allowed to tell his story without
hindrance

For hours Louis would listen patiently to all the tales of wrong-doing
of hardships and misery that were told him and he would do what
he could to right the wrongs of those who suffered

When news came of some more dreadful persecutions of Christians by
the Moslems in Palestine Louis again raised an army of Crusaders
and started with them for Tunis although he was sick and feeble so
sick indeed that he had to be carried on a litter Upon his arrival
at Tunis he was attacked by fever and died in a few days

He is better known to the world as Saint Louis than as Louis IX
because some years after his death Pope Boniface VIII canonized
him on account of his pious life and his efforts to rescue the
Holy Land from the Turks




ROBERT BRUCE

KING FROM 1306-1329

The most famous king that Scotland ever had was Robert Bruce He
lived in the days when Edward I Edward II and Edward III were
kings of England

During the reign of Edward I the king of Scotland died and thirteen
men claimed the throne Instead of fighting to decide which of
them should be king they asked Edward to settle the question When
he met the Scottish nobles and the rivals each of whom thought
that next day he would be wearing the crown Edward told them that
he would himself be their king Just then an English army marched
up What could the nobles do but kneel at the feet of Edward and
promise to be his vassals This they did and so Scotland became
a part of Edward's kingdom and Ba'li-ol one of the rivals who
claimed the Scottish throne was made the vassal king

Some time after this Edward ordered Baliol to raise an army and
help him fight the French Baliol refused to do this so Edward
marched with an army into Scotland and took him prisoner He was
determined that the Scotch should have no more kings of their own
So he carried away the sacred stone of Scone scoon on which
all kings of Scotland had to sit when they were crowned and put
it in Westminster Abbey in London and there it is to this day It
is underneath the chair on which the sovereigns of England always
sit when the crown of England Scotland and Ireland is placed upon
their heads It is said to have been the very stone that Jacob
used for a pillow on the night that he saw in his dream angels
ascending and descending on the ladder that reached from earth
to heaven

Edward now supposed as he had this sacred stone and had put King
Baliol in prison that Scotland was conquered

But the men whom he appointed to govern the Scotch ruled unwisely
and nearly all the people were discontented Suddenly an army of
Scots was raised It was led by Sir William Wallace a knight who
was almost a giant in size Wallace's men drove the English out
of the country and Wallace was made the Guardian of the Realm

Edward then led a great army against him The Scottish soldiers were
nearly all on foot Wallace arranged them in hollow squares spearmen
on the outside bowmen within The English horsemen dashed vainly
against the walls of spear-points But King Edward now brought his
archers to the front Thousands of arrows flew from their bows
and thousands of Wallace's men fell dead The spears were broken
and the Scotch were defeated Wallace barely escaped with his life
He was afterwards betrayed to Edward who cruelly put him to death

II

But the Scotch had learned what they could do and they still went
on fighting for freedom under two leaders named Robert Bruce and
John Comyn Edward marched against them with another large army
He won a great victory and the nobles once more swore to obey
him

But in spite of this oath Bruce meant to free Scotland if he could
and win the crown He was privately crowned king of Scotland in
the Abbey of Scone in 1306

He said to his wife Henceforth you are the queen and I am the
king of our country

I fear said his wife that we are only playing at being king
and queen like children in their games

Nay I shall be king in earnest said Bruce

The news that Bruce had been crowned roused all Scotland and the
people took up arms to fight under him against the English But
again King Edward defeated the Scotch and Bruce himself fled to
the Grampian Hills

For two months he was closely pursued by the English who used
bloodhounds to track him He and his followers had many narrow
escapes Once he had to scramble barefoot up some steep rocks
and another time all the party would have been captured had not
Bruce awakened just in time to hear the approach of the enemy
He and his men lived by hunting and fishing

However many brave patriots joined them until after a while Bruce
had a small army Five times he attacked the English and five
times he was beaten After his last defeat he fled from Scotland
and took refuge in a wretched hut on an island off the north coast
of Ireland Here he stayed all alone during one winter

III

It is said that one day while he was very down-hearted he saw
a spider trying to spin a web between two beams of his hut The
little creature tried to throw a thread from one beam to another
but failed Not discouraged it tried four times more without success

Illustration SCOTS IN THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN

Five times has the spider failed said Bruce That is just the
number of times the English have defeated me If the spider has
courage to try again I also will try to free Scotland

He watched the spider It rested for a while as if to gain strength
and then threw its slender thread toward the beam This time it
succeeded

I thank God exclaimed Bruce The spider has taught me a lesson
No more will I be discouraged

About this time Edward I died and his son Edward II succeeded
to the throne of England For about two years the new king paid
little attention to Scotland

Meantime Bruce captured nearly all the Scotch castles that were held
by the English and the nobles and chiefs throughout the country
acknowledged him as their king

At last Edward II marched into Scotland at the head of a hundred
thousand men Bruce met him at Bannockburn on June 24 1314 with
thirty thousand soldiers

Before the battle began Bruce rode along the front of his army
to encourage his men Suddenly an English knight Henry de Bohun
galloped across the field and tried to strike him down with a spear
Bruce saw his danger in time and with a quick stroke of his battle-axe
cleft the knight's skull

The Scotch army shouted again and again at this feat of their commander
and they went into the battle feeling sure that the victory would
be theirs They rushed upon the English with fury and although
outnumbered three to one completely defeated them Thousands of
the English were slain and a great number captured

In spite of this terrible blow Edward never gave up his claim to
the Scottish crown But his son Edward III in 1328 recognized
Scotland's independence and acknowledged Bruce as her king




MARCO POLO

LIVED FROM 1254-1324

I

Some years before St Louis led his last Crusade there was born in
Venice a boy named Marco Polo His father was a wealthy merchant
who often went on trading journeys to distant lands

In 1271 when Marco was seventeen years old he accompanied his
father and uncle on a journey through the Holy Land Persia and
Tartary and at length to the Empire of China then called Ca-thay'
It took the travelers three years to reach Cathay

The emperor of Cathay was a monarch named Kublai Khan koobli-kän'
who lived in Peking

Marco's father and uncle had been in Cathay once before and had
entertained Kublai Khan by telling him about the manners and customs
of Europe

So when the two Venetian merchants again appeared in Peking Kublai
Khan was glad to see them He was also greatly pleased with the
young Marco whom he invited to the palace

Important positions at the Chinese court were given to Marco's
father and uncle and so they and Marco lived in the country for
some years Marco studied the Chinese language and it was not
very long before he could speak it

When he was about twenty-one Kublai Khan sent him on very important
business to a distant part of China He did the work well and from
that time was often employed as an envoy of the Chinese monarch His
travels were sometimes in lands never before visited by Europeans
and he had many strange adventures among the almost unknown tribes
of Asia Step by step he was promoted For several years he was
governor of a great Chinese city

Finally he and his father and uncle desired to return to Venice
They had all served Kublai Khan faithfully and he had appreciated
it and given them rich rewards but he did not wish to let them
go

While the matter was being talked over an embassy arrived in Peking
from the king of Persia This monarch desired to marry the daughter
of Kublai Khan the Princess Cocachin and he had sent to ask her
father for her hand Consent was given and Kublai Khan fitted out
a fleet of fourteen ships to carry the wedding party to Persia

The Princess Cocachin was a great friend of Marco Polo and urged
her father to allow him to go with the party Finally Kublai Khan
gave his consent Marco's father and uncle were also allowed to
go and the three Venetians left China

Illustration VENETIAN SHIPS

The fleet with the wedding party on board sailed southward on the
China Sea It was a long and perilous voyage Stops were made at
Borneo Sumatra Ceylon and other places until the ships entered the
Persian Gulf and the princess was safely landed After they reached
the capital of Persia the party including the three Venetians was
entertained by the Persians for weeks in a magnificent manner and
costly presents were given to all

At last the Venetians left their friends went to the Black Sea
and took ship for Venice

They had been away so long and were so much changed in appearance
that none of their relations and old friends knew them when they
arrived in Venice As they were dressed in Tatar costume and sometimes
spoke the Chinese language to one another they found it hard to
convince people that they were members of the Polo family

At length on order to show that they were the men that they declared
themselves to be they gave a dinner to all their relations and old
friends When the guests arrived they were greeted by the travelers
arrayed in gorgeous Chinese robes of crimson satin After the first
course they appeared in crimson damask after the second they
changed their costumes to crimson velvet while at the end of the
dinner they appeared in the usual garb of wealthy Venetians

Now my friends said Marco I will show you something that
will please you He then brought into the room the rough Tatar
coats which he and his father and uncle had worn when they reached
Venice Cutting open the seams he took from inside the lining
packets filled with rubies emeralds and diamonds It was the finest
collection of jewels ever seen in Venice

The guests were now persuaded that their hosts were indeed what
they claimed to be

II

Eight hundred years before Marco Polo's birth some of the people
of North Italy had fled before the Attila to the muddy islands of
the Adriatic and founded Venice upon them Since then the little
settlement had become the most wealthy and powerful city of Europe
Venice was the queen of the Adriatic and her merchants were princes
They had vessels to bring the costly wares of the East to their
wharves they had warships to protect their rich cargoes from the
pirates of the Mediterranean they carried on wars At the time
when Marco Polo returned from Cathay they were at war with Gen'o-a

The two cities were fighting for the trade of the world In a great
naval battle the Venetians were completely defeated Marco Polo
was in the battle and with many of his countrymen was captured
by the enemy For a year he was confined in a Genoese prison One
of his fellow-prisoners was a skillful penman and Marco dictated
to him an account of his experiences in China Japan and other
Eastern countries This account was carefully written out Copies
of the manuscript exist to this day One of these is in a library
in Paris It was carried into France in the year 1307 Another
copy is preserved in the city of Berne It is said that the book
was translated into many languages so that people in all parts
of Europe learned about Marco's adventures

About a hundred and seventy-five years after the book was written
the famous Genoese Christopher Columbus planned his voyage across
the Atlantic It is believed that he had read Marco's description
of Java Sumatra and other East India Islands which he thought he
had reached when he discovered Hai'ti and Cuba So Marco Polo may
have suggested to Columbus the voyage which led to the discovery
of America




EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE

LIVED FROM 1330-1376

I

One of the most famous warriors of the Middle Ages was Edward the
Black Prince He was so called because he wore black armor in battle

The Black Prince was the son of Edward III who reigned over England
from 1327 to 1377 He won his fame as a soldier in the wars which
his father carried on against France

You remember that the early kings of England from the time of
William the Conqueror had possessions in France Henry II William's
grandson was the duke of Normandy and lord of Brittany and other
provinces and when he married Eleanor of Aquitaine she brought
him that province also

Henry's son John lost all the French possessions of the English
crown except a part of Aquitaine and Edward III inherited this
So when Philip of Valois val-wahbecame king of France about
a year after Edward had become king of England Edward had to do
homage to Philip

To be king of England and yet to do homage to the king of France to
bend the knee before Philip and kiss his foot was something Edward
did not like He thought it was quite beneath his dignity as his
ancestor Rollo had thought when told that he must kiss the foot
of King Charles

So Edward tried to persuade the nobles of France that he himself
ought by right to be the king of France instead of being only a
vassal Philip of Valois was only a cousin of the late French King
Charles IV Edward was the son of his sister But there was a curious
old law in France called the Salic Law which forbade that daughters
should inherit lands This law barred the claim of Edward because
his claim came through his mother Still he determined to win the
French throne by force of arms

A chance came to quarrel with Philip Another of Philip's vassals
rebelled against him and Edward helped the rebel He hoped by
doing so to weaken Philip and more easily overpower him

Philip at once declared that Edward's possessions in France were
forfeited

Then Edward raised an army of thirty thousand men and with it invaded
France

The Black Prince was now only about sixteen years of age but he
had already shown himself brave in battle and his father put him
in command of one of the divisions of the army

Thousands of French troops led by King Philip were hurried from
Paris to meet the advance of the English and on the 26th of August
1346 the two armies fought a hard battle at the village of Crécy

During the battle the division of the English army commanded by
the Black Prince had to bear the attack of the whole French force
The prince fought so bravely and managed his men so well that King
Edward who was overlooking the field of battle from a windmill
on the top of a hill sent him words of praise for his gallant
work

Again and again the prince's men drove back the French in splendid
style But at last they seemed about to give way before a very
fierce charge and the earl of Warwick hastened to Edward to advise
him to send the prince aid

Is my son dead or unhorsed or so wounded that he cannot help himself
asked the king

No Sire was the reply but he is hard pressed

Return to your post and come not to me again for aid so long as
my son lives said the king Let the boy prove himself a true
knight and win his spurs

Illustration THE BLACK PRINCE AT THE DEAD BODY OF THE KING OF
BOHEMIA

The earl went to the prince and told him what his father had said
I will prove myself a true knight exclaimed the prince My
father is right I need no aid My men will hold their post as long
as they have strength to stand

Then he rode where the battle was still furiously raging and encouraged
his men The king of France led his force a number of times against
the prince's line but could not break it and was at last compelled
to retire

The battle now went steadily against the French although they
far outnumbered the English Finally forty thousand of Philip's
soldiers lay dead upon the field and nearly all the remainder of
his army was captured Philip gave up the struggle and fled

Among those who fought on the side of the French at Crécy was the
blind king of Bohemia who always wore three white feathers in
his helmet When the battle was at its height the blind king had
his followers lead him into the thick of the fight and he dealt
heavy blows upon his unseen foes until he fell mortally wounded
The three white feathers were taken from his helmet by the Black
Prince who ever after wore them himself

As soon as he could King Edward rode over the field to meet his
son Prince he said as he greeted him you are the conqueror
of the French Turning to the soldiers who had gathered around
him the king shouted Cheer cheer for the Black Prince Cheer
for the hero of Crécy

What cheering then rose on the battle-field The air rang with the
name of the Black Prince

Soon after the battle of Crécy King Edward laid siege to Calais
but the city resisted his attack for twelve months During the
siege the Black Prince aided his father greatly

After the capture of Calais it was agreed to stop fighting for
seven years and Edward's army embarked for England

II

In 1355 Edward again declared war against the French The Black
Prince invaded France with an army of sixty thousand men He captured
rich towns and gathered a great deal of booty While he was preparing
to move on Paris the king of France raised a great army and marched
against him

The Black Prince had lost so many men by sickness that he had only
about ten thousand when he reached the city of Poitiers Suddenly
near the city he was met by the French force of about fifty-five
thousand splendidly armed and commanded by the king himself

God help us exclaimed the prince when he looked at the long
lines of the French as they marched on a plain before him

Early on the morning of September 14 1356 the battle began The
English were few in number but they were determined to contest
every inch of the ground and not surrender while a hundred of them
remained to fight For hours they withstood the onset of the French
At last a body of English horsemen charged furiously on one part
of the French line while the Black Prince attacked another part

This sudden movement caused confusion among the French Many of
them fled from the field When the Black Prince saw this he shouted
to his men Advance English banners in the name of God and St
George His army rushed forward and the French were defeated
Thousands of prisoners were taken including the king of France
and many of his nobles

The king was sent to England where he was treated with the greatest
kindness When some time afterwards there was a splendid procession
in London to celebrate the victory of Poitiers he was allowed
to ride in the procession on a beautiful white horse while the
Black Prince rode on a pony at his side

The Black Prince died in 1376 He was sincerely mourned by the
English people They felt that they had lost a prince who would
have made a great and good king




WILLIAM TELL

AND ARNOLD VON WINKELRIED

I

Far up among the Alps in the very heart of Switzerland are three
districts or cantons as they are called which are known as the
Forest Cantons and are famous in the world's history About two
thousand years ago the Romans found in these cantons a hardy race
of mountaineers who although poor were free men and proud of
their independence They became the friends and allies of Rome
and the cantons were for many years a part of the Roman Empire
but the people always had the right to elect their own officers
and to govern themselves

When Goths and the Vandals and the Huns from beyond the Rhine and
the Danube overran the Roman Empire these three cantons were not
disturbed The land was too poor and rocky to attract men who were
fighting for possession of the rich plains and valleys of Europe
and so it happened that for century after century the mountaineers
of these cantons lived on in their old simple way undisturbed
by the rest of the world

In a canton in the valley of the Rhine lived the Hapsburg family
whose leaders in time grew to be very rich and powerful They became
dukes of Austria and some of them were elected emperors One of the
Hapsburgs Albert I claimed that the land of the Forest Cantons
belonged to him He sent a governor and a band of soldiers to those
cantons and made the people submit to his authority

In one of the Forest Cantons at this time lived a famous mountaineer
named William Tell He was tall and strong In all Switzerland no
man had a foot so sure as his on the mountains or a hand so skilled
in the use of a bow He was determined to resist the Austrians

Secret meetings of the mountaineers were held and all took a solemn
oath to stand by each other and fight for their freedom but they
had no arms and were simple shepherds who had never been trained
as soldiers The first thing to be done was to get arms without
attracting the attention of the Austrians It took nearly a year
to secure spears swords and battle-axes and distribute them among
the mountains Finally this was done and everything was ready
All were waiting for a signal to rise

Illustration TELL SHOOTS THE APPLE FROM HIS SON'S HEAD

The story tells us that just at this time Gessler the Austrian
governor who was a cruel tyrant hung a cap on a high pole in
the market-place in the village of Altorf and forced everyone
who passed to bow before it Tell accompanied by his little son
happened to pass through the marketplace He refused to bow before
the cap and was arrested Gessler offered to release him if he
would shoot an apple from the head of his son The governor hated
Tell and made this offer hoping that the mountaineer's hand would
tremble and that he would kill his own son It is said that Tell
shot the apple from his son's head but that Gessler still refused
to release him That night as Tell was being carried across the
lake to prison a storm came up In the midst of the storm he sprang
from the boat to an over-hanging rock and made his escape It is
said that he killed the tyrant Some people do not believe this
story but the Swiss do and if you go to Lake Lucerne some day
they will show you the very rock upon which Tell stepped when he
sprang from the boat

That night the signal fires were lighted on every mountain and
by the dawn of day the village of Altorf was filled with hardy
mountaineers armed and ready to fight for their liberty A battle
followed and the Austrians were defeated and driven from Altorf
This victory was followed by others

Illustration TELL'S LEAP

A few years later the duke himself came with a large army determined
to conquer the mountaineers He had to march through a narrow pass
with mountains rising abruptly on either side The Swiss were expecting
him and hid along the heights above the pass as soon as the Austrians
appeared in the pass rocks and trunks of trees were hurled down
upon them Many were killed and wounded Their army was defeated
and the duke was forced to recognize the independence of the Forest
Cantons

This was the beginning of the Republic of Switzerland In time five
other cantons joined them in a compact for liberty

II

About seventy years later the Austrians made another attempt to
conquer the patriots They collected a splendid army and marched
into the mountains The Swiss at once armed themselves and met
the Austrians at a place called Sempach In those times powder
had not been invented and men fought with spears swords and
battle-axes The Austrian soldiers stood shoulder to shoulder
each grasping a long spear whose point projected far in front of
him The Swiss were armed with short swords and spears and it was
impossible for them to get to the Austrians For a while their
cause looked hopeless but among the ranks of the Swiss was a brave
man from one of the Forest Cantons His name was Arnold von
Win'kel-ried As he looked upon the bristling points of the Austrian
spears he saw that his comrades had no chance to win unless an
opening could be made in that line He determined to make such
an opening even at the cost of his life Extending his arms as
far as he could he rushed toward the Austrian line and gathered
within his arms as many spears as he could grasp

Make way for liberty he cried 
Then ran with arms extended wide
As if his dearest friend to clasp
Ten spears he swept within his grasp
Make way for liberty he cried 
Their keen points met from side to side
He bowed among them like a tree
And thus made way for liberty

Pierced through and through Winkelried fell dead but he had made
a gap in the Austrian line and into this gap rushed the Swiss
patriots Victory was theirs and the Cantons were free

TAMERLANE

LIVED FROM 1333-1405

I

Tamerlane was the son of the chief of a Mongolian tribe in Central
Asia His real name was Timour but as he was lamed in battle when
a youth he was generally called Timour the Lame and this name
was gradually changed to Tamerlane He was born in 1333 so that
he lived in the time of the English king Edward III when the
Black Prince was winning his victories over the French He was
a descendant of a celebrated Tatar soldier Genghis jen'ghis
Khan who conquered Persia China and other countries of Asia
When twenty-four years old Tamerlane became the head of his tribe
and in a few years he made himself the leader of the whole Mongolian
race

He was a tall stern-looking man of great strength and although
lame in his right leg could ride a spirited horse at full gallop
and do all the work of an active soldier He was as brave as a
lion and as cruel

He chose the ancient city of Sa-mar-candin Tur-kis-tanfor
his capital and here he built a beautiful marble palace where
he lived in the greatest luxury

Illustration TAMERLANE

After he had enjoyed for some time the honors which fell to him as
chief ruler of the Mongolians he began to desire further conquests
He determined to make himself master of all the countries of Central
Asia

As there is but one God in heaven he said there ought to be
but one ruler on the earth

So he gathered an immense army from all parts of his dominion
and for weeks his subjects were busy making preparations for war
At length he started for Persia in command of a splendid army
After gaining some brilliant victories he forced the Persian king
to flee from his capital

All the rich country belonging to Persia from the Tigris to the
Euphrates submitted to the Mongolian conqueror

Tamerlane celebrated his Persian conquest by magnificent festivities
which continued for a week Then orders were given to march into
the great Tatar empire of the North Here Tamerlane was victorious
over the principal chiefs and made them his vassals In pursuing
the Tatars he entered Russia and sacked and burned some of the
Russian cities He did not however continue his invasion of this
country but turned in the direction of India

At last his army stood before the city of Delhi and after a fierce
assault forced it to surrender Other cities of India were taken
and the authority of Tamerlane was established over a large extent
of the country

II

Baj-a-zetsultan of Turkey now determined to stop Tamerlane's
eastward march

News of this reached the conqueror's ears Leaving India he marched
to meet the sultan Bajazet was a famous warrior He was so rapid
in his movements in war that he was called the lightning

Tamerlane entered the sultan's dominions and devastated them He
stormed Bagdad and after capturing the place killed thousands
of the inhabitants

At length the rivals and their armies faced each other A great
battle followed It raged four or five hours and then the Turks
were totally defeated Bajazet was captured

Tamerlane then ordered a great iron cage to be made and forced
the sultan to enter it The prisoner was chained to the iron bars
of the cage and was thus exhibited to the Mongol soldiers who
taunted him as he was carried along the lines

As the army marched from place to place the sultan in his cage
was shown to the people How long the fallen monarch had to bear
this humiliating punishment is not known

Tamerlane's dominions now embraced a large part of Asia He retired
to his palace at Samarcand and for several weeks indulged in
festivities

He could not however long be content away from the field of battle
So he made up his mind to invade the Empire of China At the head of
a great army of two hundred thousand soldiers he marched from the
city of Samarcand towards China He had gone about three hundred
miles on the way when in February 1405 he was taken sick and
died His army was disbanded and all thought of invading China
was given up

Thus passed away one of the greatest conquerors of the Middle Ages
He was a soldier of genius but he cannot be called a truly great
man His vast empire speedily fell to pieces after his death Since
his day there has been no leader like him in that part of Asia




HENRY V

KING FROM 1413-1422

I

Of all the kings that England ever had Henry V was perhaps the
greatest favorite among the people They liked him because he was
handsome and brave and above all because he conquered France

In his youth Prince Hal as the people called him had a number
of merry companions who sometimes got themselves into trouble by
their pranks Once one of them was arrested and brought before
the chief justice of the kingdom

Prince Hal was not pleased because sentence was given against his
companion and he drew his sword threatening the judge Upon this
the judge bravely ordered the prince to be arrested and put into
prison

Prince Hal submitted to his punishment with good grace and his
father is reported to have said Happy is the monarch who has so
just a judge and a son so willing to obey the law

One of Prince Hal's companions was a fat old knight named Sir John
Falstaff Once Falstaff was boasting that he and three men had
beaten and almost killed two men in buckram suits who had attacked
and tried to rob them The prince led him on and gave him a chance
to brag as much as he wanted to until finally Falstaff swore that
there were at least a hundred robbers and that he himself fought
with fifty Then Prince Hal told their companions that only two
men had attacked Falstaff and his friends and that he and another
man who was present were those two And he said that Falstaff
instead of fighting had run as fast as his legs could carry him

There was real goodness as well as merriment in Prince Hal And
so the people found for when he became king on the death of his
father he told his wild companions that the days of his wildness
were over and he advised them to lead better lives in future

As Henry V Prince Hal made himself famous in English history by
his war with France

Normandy you remember had belonged to Henry's ancestor William
the Conqueror It had been taken from King John of England by the
French king Philip Augustus in 1203

Soon after his coronation Henry sent a demand to the French king
that Normandy should be restored and he made the claim which his
great-grandfather Edward III had made that he was by right the
king of France

Illustration KING HENRY V REJECTS HIS EARLY COMPANIONS

Of course the king of France would not acknowledge this Henry
therefore raised an army of thirty thousand men and invaded France

Before he began to attack the French he gave strict orders to his
men that they were to harm no one who was not a soldier and to
take nothing from the houses or farms of any persons who were not
fighting

Sickness broke out among Henry's troops after they landed so that
their number was reduced to about fifteen thousand Fifty or sixty
thousand Frenchmen were encamped on the field of Agincourt
äzh-an-koorto oppose this little army

The odds were greatly against Henry The night before the battle
one of his officers said he wished that the many thousand brave
soldiers who were quietly sleeping in their beds in England were
with the king

I would not have a single man more said Henry If God give
us victory it will be plain we owe it to His grace If not the
fewer we are the less loss for England

Illustration CHARGE OF THE FRENCH AT THE BATTLE OF AGINCOURT

The men drew courage from their king The English archers poured
arrows into the ranks of their opponents and although the French
fought bravely they were completely routed Eleven thousand Frenchmen
fell Among the slain were more than a hundred of the nobles of
the land

II

Agincourt was not the last of Henry's victories He brought a second
army of forty thousand men over to France Town after town was
captured and at last Henry and his victorious troops laid siege
to Rouen which was then the largest and richest city in France

The fortifications were so strong that Henry could not storm them
so he determined to take the place by starving the garrison He
said War has three handmaidens fire blood and famine I have
chosen the meekest of the three

He had trenches dug round the town and placed soldiers in them
to prevent citizens from going out of the city for supplies and
to prevent the country people from taking provisions in

A great number of the country people had left their homes when
they heard that the English army was marching towards Rouen and
had taken refuge within the city walls After the siege had gone
on for six months there was so little food left in the place that
the commander of the garrison ordered these poor people to go back
to their homes

Twelve thousand were put outside the gates but Henry would not
allow them to pass through his lines so they starved to death
between the walls of the French and the trenches of the English

As winter came on the suffering of the citizens was terrible At
last they determined to set fire to the city open their gates
and make a last desperate attack on the English

Henry wished to preserve the city and offered such generous terms
of surrender that the people accepted them Not only Rouen but
the whole of Normandy which the French had held for two hundred
years was now forced to submit to Henry

The war continued for about two years more and the English gained
possession of such a large part of France that at Christmas Henry
entered Paris itself in triumph

But strange to say the king against whom he had been fighting
and over whom he was triumphing sat by his side as he rode through
the streets What did this mean It meant that the French were
so terrified by the many victories of Henry that all king and
people were willing to give him whatever he asked A treaty was
made that as the king was feeble Henry should be regent of the
kingdom and that when the king died Henry should succeed him as
king of France

In the treaty the French king also agreed to give to Henry his
daughter the Princess Katherine in marriage She became the mother
of the English King Henry VI

The arrangement that an English sovereign should be king of France
was never put into effect for in less than two years after the
treaty was signed the reign of the great conqueror came to an end
Henry died

In the reign of his son all his work in gaining French territory
was undone By the time that Henry VI was twenty years old England
as you will read in the story of Joan of Arc had nothing left of
all that had been won by so many years of war except the single
town of Calais




JOAN OF ARC

LIVED FROM 1412-1431

I

In the long wars between the French and English not even the Black
Prince or King Henry V gained such fame as did a young French peasant
girl Joan of Arc

She was born in the little village of Domremy dom-re-meHer
father had often told her of the sad condition of France how the
country was largely in the possession of England and how the French
king did not dare to be crowned

And so the thought came to be ever in her mind How I pity my
country She brooded over the matter so much that by and by she
began to have visions of angels and heard strange voices which
said to her Joan you can deliver the land from the English
Go to the relief of King Charles

At last these strange visions and voices made the young girl believe
that she had a mission from God and she determined to try to save
France

When she told her father and mother of her purpose they tried
to persuade her that the visions of angels and the voices telling
her of the divine mission were but dreams I tell thee Joan
said her father it is thy fancy Thou hadst better have a kind
husband to take care of thee and do some work to employ thy mind

Illustration JOAN'S VISION

Father I must do what God has willed for this is no work of
my choosing she replied Mother I would far rather sit and
spin by your side than take part in war My mission is no dream
I know that I have been chosen by the Lord to fulfill His purpose
and nothing can prevent me from going where He purposes to send
me

The village priest her young companions even the governor of the
town all tried to stop her but it was in vain

To the governor she said I must do the work my Lord has laid out
for me

Little by little people began to believe in her mission At last
all stopped trying to discourage her and some who were wealthy
helped her to make the journey to the town of Chinon she-non'
where the French king Charles the Seventh was living

II

When Joan arrived at Chinon a force of French soldiers was preparing
to go to the south of France to relieve the city of Orleans which
the English were besieging

King Charles received Joan kindly and listened to what she had
to say with deep attention The girl spoke modestly but with a
calm belief that she was right

Gracious King she said my name is Joan God has sent me to
deliver France from her enemies You shall shortly be crowned in
the cathedral of Rheims remz I am to lead the soldiers you
are about to send for the relief of Orleans So God has directed
and under my guidance victory will be theirs

The king and his nobles talked the matter over and finally it was
decided to allow Joan to lead an army of about five thousand men
against the English at Orleans

When she left Chinon at the head of her soldiers in April 1429
she was in her eighteenth year Mounted on a fine war-horse and
clad in white armor from head to foot she rode along past the
cheering multitude seeming rather it has been said of heaven
than earth In one hand she carried an ancient sword that she had
found near the tomb of a saint and in the other a white banner
embroidered with lilies

The rough soldiers who were near her left off their oaths and coarse
manners and carefully guarded her She inspired the whole army
with courage and faith as she talked about her visions

When she arrived at the besieged city of Orleans she fearlessly
rode round its walls while the English soldiers looked on in
astonishment She was able to enter Orleans despite the efforts
of the besiegers to prevent her

She aroused the city by her cheerful confident words and then led
her soldiers forth to give battle to the English Their success
was amazing One after another the English forts were taken

When only the strongest remained and Joan was leading the attacking
force she received a slight wound and was carried out of the battle
to be attended by a surgeon Her soldiers began to retreat Wait
she commanded eat and drink and rest for as soon as I recover I
will touch the walls with my banner and you shall enter the fort
In a few minutes she mounted her horse again and riding rapidly
up to the fort touched it with her banner Her soldier almost
instantly carried it The very next day the enemy's troops were
forced to withdraw from before the city and the siege was at end

The French soldiers were jubilant at the victory and called Joan
the Maid of Orleans By this name she is known in history Her
fame spread everywhere and the English as well as the French thought
she had more than human power

She led the French in several other battles and again and again
her troops were victorious

At last the English were driven far to the north of France Then
Charles urged by Joan went to Rheims with twelve thousand soldiers
and there with splendid ceremonies was crowned king Joan holding
her white banner stood near Charles during the coronation

When the ceremony was finished she knelt at his feet and said
O King the will of God is done and my mission is over Let me
now go home to my parents

But the king urged her to stay a while longer as France was not
entirely freed from the English Joan consented but she said
I hear the heavenly voices no more and I am afraid

However she took part in an attack upon the army of the Duke of
Burgundy but was taken prisoner by him For a large sum of money
the duke delivered her into the hands of the English who put her
in prison in Rouen She lay in prison for a year and finally was
charged with sorcery and brought to trial It was said that she
was under the influence of the Evil One She declared to her judges
her innocence of the charge and said God has always been my guide
in all that I have done The devil has never had power over me

Her trial was long and tiresome At its close she was doomed to
be burned at the stake

So in the market-place at Rouen the English soldiers fastened her
to a stake surrounded by a great pile of fagots

A soldier put into her hands a rough cross which he had made from
a stick that he held She thanked him and pressed it to her bosom
Then a good priest standing near the stake read to her the prayers
for the dying and another mounted the fagots and held towards her
a crucifix which she clasped with both hands and kissed When
the cruel flames burst out around her the noble girl uttered the
word Jesus and expired

Illustration JOAN OF ARC BOUND TO THE STAKE

A statue of her now stands on the spot where she suffered

Among all the men of her time none did nobler work than Joan And
hence it is that we put the story of her life among the stories
of the lives of the great men of the Middle Ages although she
was only a simple peasant girl




GUTENBERG

LIVED FROM 1400-1468

I

While Joan of Arc was busy rescuing France from the English another
wonderful worker was busy in Germany This was John Gutenberg
who was born in Mainz

The Germans and most other people think that he was the inventor
of the art of printing with movable types And so in the cities
of Dresden and Mainz his countrymen have put up statues in his
memory

Gutenberg's father was a man of good family Very likely the boy
was taught to read But the books from which he learned were not
like ours they were written by hand A better name for them than
books is manuscripts which means hand-writings

While Gutenberg was growing up a new way of making books came into
use which was a great deal better than copying by hand It was
what is called block-printing The printer first cut a block of
hard wood the size of the page that he was going to print Then
he cut out every word of the written page upon the smooth face of
his block This had to be very carefully done When it was finished
the printer had to cut away the wood from the sides of every letter
This left the letters raised as the letters are in books now printed
for the blind

The block was now ready to be used The letters were inked paper
was laid upon them and pressed down

With blocks the printer could make copies of a book a great deal
faster than a man could write them by hand But the making of the
blocks took a long time and each block would print only one page

Gutenberg enjoyed reading the manuscripts and block books that his
parents and their wealthy friends had and he often said it was a
pity that only rich people could own books Finally he determined
to contrive some easy and quick way of printing

He did a great deal of his work in secret for he thought it was
much better that his neighbors should know nothing of what he was
doing

So he looked for a workshop where no one would be likely to find
him He was now living in Strasburg and there was in that city
a ruined old building where long before his time a number of
monks had lived There was one room of the building which needed
only a little repairing to make it fit to be used So Gutenberg
got the right to repair that room and use it as his workshop

All his neighbors wondered what became of him when he left home in
the early morning and where he had been when they saw him coming
back late in the twilight Some felt sure that he must be a wizard
and that he had meetings somewhere with the devil and that the
devil was helping him to do some strange business

Gutenberg did not care much what people had to say and in his
quiet room he patiently tried one experiment after another often
feeling very sad and discouraged day after day because his experiments
did not succeed

At last the time came when he had no money left He went back to
his old home Mainz and there met a rich goldsmith named Fust
or Faust

Gutenberg told him how hard he had tried in Strasburg to find some
way of making books cheaply and how he had now no more money to
carry on his experiments Fust became greatly interested and gave
Gutenberg what money he needed But as the experiments did not
at first succeed Fust lost patience He quarreled with Gutenberg
and said that he was doing nothing but spending money At last
he brought suit against him in the court and the judge decided
in favor of Fust So everything in the world that Gutenberg had
even the tools with which he worked came into Fust's possession

Illustration GUTENBERG AT WORK

II

But though he had lost his tools Gutenberg had not lost his courage
And he had not lost all his friends One of them had money and
he bought Gutenberg a new set of tools and hired a workshop for
him And now at last Gutenberg's hopes were fulfilled

First of all it is thought that he made types of hard wood Each
type was a little block with a single letter at one end Such types
were a great deal better than block letters The block letters
were fixed They could not be taken out of the words of which they
were parts The new types were movable so they could be set up to
print one page then taken apart and set up again and again to
print any number of pages

But type made of wood did not always print the letters clearly and
distinctly so Gutenberg gave up wood types and tried metal types
Soon a Latin Bible was printed It was in two volumes each of which
had three hundred pages while each of the pages had forty-two
lines The letters were sharp and clear They had been printed from
movable types of metal

III

The Dutch claim that Lorenz Coster a native of Harlem in the
Netherlands was the first person who printed with movable type
They say that Coster was one day taking a walk in a beech forest
not far from Harlem and that he cut bark from one of the trees
and shaped it with his knife into letters

Not long after this the Dutch say Coster had made movable types
and was printing and selling books in Harlem

The news that books were being printed in Mainz by Gutenberg went
all over Europe and before he died printing-presses like his were
at work making books in all the great cities of the continent

About twenty years after his death when Venice was the richest
of European cities a man named Al'-dus Ma-nu'tius established
there the most famous printing house of that time He was at work
printing books two years before Columbus sailed on his first voyage
The descendents of Aldus continued the business after his death for
about one hundred years The books published by them were called
Aldine from Aldus They were the most beautiful that had ever
come from the press They are admired and valued to this day




WARWICK THE KINGMAKER

LIVED FROM 1428-1471

I

The earl of Warwick known as the kingmaker was the most famous
man in England for many years after the death of Henry V He lived
in a great castle with two towers higher than most church spires
It is one of the handsomest dwellings in the world and is visited
every year by thousands of people The kingmaker had a guard of
six hundred men At his house in London meals were served to so
many people that six fat oxen were eaten at breakfast alone He
had a hundred and ten estates in different parts of England and
no less than 30000 persons were fed daily at his board He owned
the whole city of Worcester and besides this and three islands
Jersey Guernsey and Alderney so famed in our time for their cattle
belonged to him

He had a cousin of whom he was as fond as if he were a brother
This was Richard duke of York who was also own cousin to King
Henry VI the son of Henry V

One evening as the sun was setting and the warders were going to
close the gates of the city of York for the night a loud blast
of a horn was heard It was made by the sentry on the wall near
the southern gate An armed troop was approaching When they drew
near the gate their scarlet coats embroidered with the figure of
a boar proved them to be the men of the earl of Warwick The earl
himself was behind them The gate was opened

Passing through it and on to the castle the earl and his company
were soon within its strong stone walls

Cousin said the earl of Warwick to the duke of York as they sat
talking before a huge log fire in the great room of the castle
England will not long endure the misrule of a king who is half
the time out of his mind

The earl spoke the truth Every now and then Henry VI lost his
reason and the duke of York or some other nobleman had to govern
the kingdom for him

The earl of Warwick added You are the rightful heir to the throne
The claim of Henry VI comes through Lancaster the fourth son of
Edward III yours through Lionel the second His claim comes through
his father only yours through both your father and mother It is
a better claim and it is a double claim

That is true my cousin of Warwick replied the duke of York
but we must not plunge England into war

Surely not if we can help it replied the earl Let us first
ask for reform If the king heeds our petition well and good
If not I am determined cousin of York that you shall sit on the
throne of England instead of our insane sovereign

A petition was soon drawn up and signed and presented to Henry
It asked that Henry would do something which would make the people
contented

The king paid no attention to it Then a war began It was the
longest and most terrible that ever took place in England It lasted
for thirty years

Those who fought on the king's side were called Lancastrians because
Henry's ancestor John of Gaunt was the duke of Lancaster The
friends of Richard were called Yorkists because he was duke of
York The Lancastrians took a red rose for their badge the Yorkists
a white one For this reason the long struggle has always been
called the War of the Roses

In the first great battle the Red Rose party was defeated and the
king himself was taken prisoner

The victors now thought that the duke of York ought to be made king
at once However a parliament was called to decide the question
and it was agreed that Henry should be king as long as he lived
but that at his death the crown should pass to the duke of York

II

Most people though this was a wise arrangement but Queen Margaret
Henry's wife did not like it at all because it took from her
son the right to reign after his father's death So she went to
Scotland and the North of England where she had many friends
and raised an army

She was a brave woman and led her men in a battle in which she
gained the victory The duke of York was killed and the queen
ordered some of her men to cut off his head put upon it a paper
crown in mockery and fix it over one of the gates of the city
of York

Warwick attacked the queen again as soon as he could but again
she was victorious and captured from Warwick her husband the king
whom the earl had held prisoner for some time past

This was a great triumph for Margaret for Henry became king once
more

Illustration MARGARET INTRUSTS HER SON TO THE ROBBER

But the people were still discontented The York party was determined
that Edward the son of the old duke of York should be made king
So thousands flocked to the White Rose standard and Warwick marched
to London at their head

The queen saw that her only safety was in flight She left London
and the kingmaker entered the city in triumph

The citizens had been very fond of the old duke of York and when
his party proclaimed his handsome young son King Edward IV the
city resounded with the cry God save King Edward

Brave Queen Margaret was completely defeated in another battle
The story is told that after this she fled into a forest with her
young son A robber met them but Margaret with wonderful courage
said to him I am your queen and this is your prince I entrust
him to your care

The man was pleased with the confidence that she showed He took
her and the young prince to a safe hiding place and helped them
to escape from England in a sailing vessel

III

Edward IV now seemed to be seated securely upon the throne But
trouble was near Warwick wished him to follow his advice Edward
thought he could manage without any advice Then the king and the
kingmaker quarreled and at last became open enemies and fought
one another on the field of battle The end of it was that Warwick
was defeated and driven out of the country He sailed across the
channel and sought refuge in France

There whom should he meet but his old enemy Queen Margaret She
had beaten him in battle and had beheaded his cousin Richard
duke of York he had beaten her and driven her from her kingdom
and twice he had made her husband prisoner and taken from him his
crown In spite of all this the two now became fast friends and
the kingmaker agreed to make war upon Edward and restore Henry
to the throne

He asked assistance from Louis XI king of France who supplied
him with men and money So with an army of Frenchmen the kingmaker
landed on the shores of England Thousands of Englishmen who were
tired of Edward flocked to Warwick's standard and when he reached
London he had an army of sixty thousand men

Edward fled without waiting for a battle and escaped to the Netherlands
in a sailing-vessel The kingmaker had now no one to resist him
The gates of London were opened to him and the citizens heartily
welcomed him Marching to the Tower he brought out the old king
and placed him once more upon the throne

But though Edward had fled he was not discouraged He followed
the example of the kingmaker and asked aid from foreign friends
The duke of Burgundy supplied him with money and soldiers and
he was soon back in England

His army grew larger and larger every day People had been very
much dissatisfied with Edward and had rejoiced to get rid of him
and have Henry for king because if Henry was not clever he was
good But in a short time they had found out that England needed
a king who was not only good but capable

So when Edward and his French soldiers landed most people in England
welcomed them The kingmaker was now on the wrong side

Edward met him in battle at a place called Barnet and completely
defeated him Warwick was killed and Henry once more became prisoner

In another battle both Margaret and her son were made prisoners The
son was brutally murdered in the presence of King Edward Margaret
was placed in the Tower and King Henry who died soon after the
battle of Tewksbury was probably poisoned by order of Edward

In 1438 after a reign of twenty-two years Edward died leaving
two sons Both were boys so Edward's brother Richard duke of
Gloucester was made regent until young Edward V the older of
the two should come of age

Illustration THE PRINCES IN THE TOWER

But Richard was determined to make himself king So he put both
the young princes in the Tower He than hired ruffians to murder
them One night when the little princes were asleep the murderers
smothered them with pillows and buried their bodies at the foot
of a stairway in the Tower and there after many years their
bones were found

After Richard had murdered his two nephews he was crowned king
as Richard III much pleased that his plans had succeeded so well
He thought that now nobody could lay claim to the throne But he
was mistaken One person did claim it This was Henry Tudor earl
of Richmond

Henry's father Edmund Tudor was only a Welsh gentleman but was
the half-brother of Henry VI through their mother Queen Katherine
Henry's mother was descended from John of Gaunt fourth son of
Edward III and thus through his mother he was of royal blood and
a Lancastrian

When Richard III by his wickedness and cruelty had made all England
hate him the Red Rose party gathered about Henry Tudor raised
an army and fought against the king in the battle of Bosworth

Richard was a bad man but he was brave and he fought like a lion
However it was all in vain He was defeated and killed His body
was thrown on the back of a horse carried to a church near the
field of battle and buried

The battered crown which Richard had worn was picked up and placed
on Henry's head and the whole Lancastrian army shouted Long live
King Henry

Parliament now voted that Henry Tudor and his heirs should be kings
of England Not long afterwards Henry married the heiress of the house
of York and thus both the Red Roses and the White were satisfied
as the king was a Lancastrian and the queen a Yorkist So the long
and terrible Wars of the Roses came to an end


It has been so long since I promised you the story of my adventures
that I have decided to make good my word today and seeing that we have
thus fortunately met not to discuss scientific matters alone but also
to enliven our jolly conversation with witty stories  Fabricius Veiento
has already spoken very cleverly on the errors committed in the name of
religion and shown how priests animated by an hypocritical mania for
prophecy boldly expound mysteries which are too often such to
themselves  But are our rhetoricians tormented by another species of
Furies when they cry I received these wounds while fighting for the
public liberty I lost this eye in your defense give me a guide who will
lead me to my children my limbs are hamstrung and will not hold me up
Even these heroics could be endured if they made easier the road to
eloquence but as it is their sole gain from this ferment of matter and
empty discord of words is that when they step into the Forum they think
they have been carried into another world  And it is my conviction that
the schools are responsible for the gross foolishness of our young men
because in them they see or hear nothing at all of the affairs of
every-day life but only pirates standing in chains upon the shore
tyrants scribbling edicts in which sons are ordered to behead their own
fathers responses from oracles delivered in time of pestilence
ordering the immolation of three or more virgins every word a honied
drop every period sprinkled with poppy-seed and sesame




CHAPTER THE SECOND

Those who are brought up on such a diet can no more attain to wisdom than
a kitchen scullion can attain to a keen sense of smell or avoid stinking
of the grease  With your indulgence I will speak out you teachers
are chiefly responsible for the decay of oratory  With your well
modulated and empty tones you have so labored for rhetorical effect that
the body of your speech has lost its vigor and died  Young men did not
learn set speeches in the days when Sophocles and Euripides were
searching for words in which to express themselves  In the days when
Pindar and the nine lyric poets feared to attempt Homeric verse there was
no private tutor to stifle budding genius  I need not cite the poets for
evidence for I do not find that either Plato or Demosthenes was given
to this kind of exercise  A dignified and if I may say it a chaste
style is neither elaborate nor loaded with ornament it rises supreme by
its own natural purity  This windy and high-sounding bombast a recent
immigrant to Athens from Asia touched with its breath the aspiring
minds of youth with the effect of some pestilential planet and as soon
as the tradition of the past was broken eloquence halted and was
stricken dumb  Since that who has attained to the sublimity of
Thucydides who rivalled the fame of Hyperides  Not a single poem
has glowed with a healthy color but all of them as though nourished
on the same diet lacked the strength to live to old age  Painting
also suffered the same fate when the presumption of the Egyptians
commercialized that incomparable art  I was holding forth along these
lines one day when Agamemnon came up to us and scanned with a curious
eye a person to whom the audience was listening so closely




CHAPTER THE THIRD

He would not permit me to declaim longer in the portico than he himself
had sweat in the school but exclaimed Your sentiments do not reflect
the public taste young man and you are a lover of common sense which
is still more unusual  For that reason I will not deceive you as to the
secrets of my profession  The teachers who must gibber with lunatics
are by no means to blame for these exercises  Unless they spoke in
accordance with the dictates of their young pupils they would as Cicero
remarks be left alone in the schools  And as designing parasites when
they seek invitations to the tables of the rich have in mind nothing
except what will in their opinion be most acceptable to their audience
for in no other way can they secure their ends save by setting snares
for the ears so it is with the teachers of rhetoric they might be
compared with the fisherman who unless he baits his hook with what he
knows is most appetizing to the little fish may wait all day upon some
rock without the hope of a catch




CHAPTER THE FOURTH

What then is there to do  The parents who are unwilling to permit
their children to undergo a course of training under strict discipline
are the ones who deserve the reproof  In the first place everything
they possess including the children is devoted to ambition  Then that
their wishes may the more quickly be realized they drive these unripe
scholars into the forum and the profession of eloquence than which none
is considered nobler devolves upon boys who are still in the act of
being born  If however they would permit a graded course of study to
be prescribed in order that studious boys might ripen their minds by
diligent reading balance their judgment by precepts of wisdom correct
their compositions with an unsparing pen hear at length what they ought
to imitate and be convinced that nothing can be sublime when it is
designed to catch the fancy of boys then the grand style of oratory
would immediately recover the weight and splendor of its majesty  Now
the boys play in the schools the young men are laughed at in the forum
and a worse symptom than either no one in his old age will confess
the errors he was taught in his school days  But that you may not
imagine that I disapprove of a jingle in the Lucilian manner I will
deliver my opinions in verse 




CHAPTER THE FIFTH

The man who emerges with fame from the school of stern art

Whose mind gropes for lofty ideals to bring them to light

Must first under rigid frugality study his part

Nor yearn for the courts of proud princes who frown in their might

Nor scheme with the riff-raf a client in order to dine

Nor can he with evil companions his wit drown in wine

Nor sit as a hireling applauding an actor's grimace

But whether the fortress of arms-bearing Tritonis smile

Upon him or land which the Spartan colonials grace

Or home of the sirens with poetry let him beguile

The years of young manhood and at the Maeonian spring

His fortunate soul drink its fill Then when later the lore

Of Socratesschool he has mastered the reins let him fling

And brandish the weapons that mighty Demosthenes bore

Then steeped in the culture and music of Greece let his taste

Be ripened and mellowed by all the great writers of Rome

At first let him haunt not the courts let his pages be graced

By ringing and rhythmic effusions composed in his home

Next banquets and wars be his theme sung in soul-stirring chant

In eloquent words such as undaunted Cicero chose

Come  Gird up thy soul  Inspiration will then force a vent

And rush in a flood from a heart that is loved by the muse




CHAPTER THE SIXTH

I was listening so attentively to this speech that I did not notice the
flight of Ascyltos and while I was pacing the gardens engulfed in this
flood-tide of rhetoric a large crowd of students came out upon the
portico having it would seem just listened to an extemporaneous
declamation of I know not whom the speaker of which had taken
exceptions to the speech of Agamemnon  While therefore the young men
were making fun of the sentiments of this last speaker and criticizing
the arrangement of the whole speech I seized the opportunity and went
after Ascyltos on the run but as I neither held strictly to the road
nor knew where the inn was located wherever I went I kept coming back
to the same place until worn out with running and long since dripping
with sweat I approached a certain little old woman who sold country
vegetables




CHAPTER THE SEVENTH

Please mother I wheedled you don't know where I lodge do you
Delighted with such humorous affability What's the reason I don't she
replied and getting upon her feet she commenced to walk ahead of me  I
took her for a prophetess until when presently we came to a more obscure
quarter the affable old lady pushed aside a crazy-quilt and remarked
Here's where you ought to live and when I denied that I recognized the
house I saw some men prowling stealthily between the rows of name-boards
and naked prostitutes  Too late I realized that I had been led into a
brothel  After cursing the wiles of the little old hag I covered my
head and commenced to run through the middle of the night-house to the
exit opposite when lo and behold whom should I meet on the very
threshold but Ascyltos himself as tired as I was and almost dead you
would have thought that he had been brought by the self-same little old
hag  I smiled at that greeted him cordially and asked him what he was
doing in such a scandalous place




CHAPTER THE EIGHTH

Wiping away the sweat with his hands he replied If you only knew what
I have gone through  What was it  I demanded  A most respectable
looking person came up to me he made reply while I was wandering all
over the town and could not find where I had left my inn and very
graciously offered to guide me  He led me through some very dark and
crooked alleys to this place pulled out his tool and commenced to beg
me to comply with his appetite  A whore had already vacated her cell for
an as and he had laid hands upon me and but for the fact that I was
the stronger I would have been compelled to take my medicine  While
Ascyltos was telling me of his bad luck who should come up again but
this same very respectable looking person in company with a woman not at
all bad looking and looking at Ascyltos he requested him to enter the
house assuring him that there was nothing to fear and since he was
unwilling to take the passive part he should have the active  The
woman on her part urged me very persistently to accompany her so we
followed the couple at last and were conducted between the rows of
name-boards where we saw in cells many persons of each sex amusing
themselves in such a manner that it seemed to me that every one of them
must have been drinking satyrion  On catching sight of us they
attempted to seduce us with paederastic wantonness and one wretch with
his clothes girded up assaulted Ascyltos and having thrown him down
upon a couch attempted to gore him from above  I succored the sufferer
immediately however and having joined forces we defied the
troublesome wretch  Ascyltos ran out of the house and took to his
heels leaving me as the object of their lewd attacks but the crowd
finding me the stronger in body and purpose let me go unharmed




CHAPTER THE NINTH

After having tramped nearly all over the city I caught sight of Giton
as though through a fog standing at the end of the street on the very
threshold of the inn and I hastened to the same place  When I inquired
whether my brother had prepared anything for breakfast the boy sat
down upon the bed and wiped away the trickling tears with his thumb
I was greatly disturbed by such conduct on the part of my brother and
demanded to be told what had happened  After I had mingled threats with
entreaties he answered slowly and against his will That brother or
comrade of yours rushed into the room a little while ago and commenced to
attempt my virtue by force  When I screamed he pulled out his tool and
gritted out If you're a Lucretia you've found your Tarquin  When I
heard this I shook my fists in Ascyltosface What have you to say for
yourself I snarled you rutting pathic harlot whose very breath is
infected  Ascyltos pretended to bristle up and shaking his fists more
boldly still he roared Won't you keep quiet you filthy gladiator you
who escaped from the criminal's cage in the amphitheatre to which you
were condemned for the murder of your host  Won't you hold your
tongue you nocturnal assassin who even when you swived it bravely
never entered the lists with a decent woman in your life  Was I not a
'brotherto you in the pleasure-garden in the same sense as that in
which this boy now is in this lodging-house  You sneaked away from the
master's lecture I objected




CHAPTER THE TENTH  What should I have done you triple fool when I was
dying of hunger  I suppose I should have listened to opinions as much to
the purpose as the tinkle of broken glass or the interpretation of
dreams  By Hercules you are much more deserving of censure than I you
who will flatter a poet so as to get an invitation to dinner  Then we
laughed ourselves out of a most disgraceful quarrel and approached more
peaceably whatever remained to be done  But the remembrance of that
injury recurred to my mind and Ascyltos I said I know we shall not
be able to agree so let us divide our little packs of common stock and
try to defeat our poverty by our individual efforts  Both you and I know
letters but that I may not stand in the way of any undertaking of yours
I will take up some other profession  Otherwise a thousand trifles will
bring us into daily collision and furnish cause for gossip through the
whole town  Ascyltos made no objection to this but merely remarked
As we in our capacity of scholars have accepted an invitation to
dinner for this date let us not lose our night  Since it seems to be
the graceful thing to do I will look out for another lodging and another
'brothertomorrow  Deferred pleasures are a long time coming
I sighed  It was lust that made this separation so hasty for I had for
a long time wished to be rid of a troublesome chaperon so that I could
resume my old relations with my Giton  Bearing this affront with
difficulty Ascyltos rushed from the room without uttering a word
Such a headlong outburst augured badly for I well knew his ungovernable
temper and his unbridled passion  On this account I followed him out
desirous of fathoming his designs and of preventing their consequences
but he hid himself skillfully from my eyes and all in vain I searched
for him for a long time




CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH

After having had the whole town under my eyes I returned to the little
room and having claimed the kisses which were mine in good faith I
encircled the boy in the closest of embraces and enjoyed the effect of
our happy vows to a point that might be envied  Nor had all the
ceremonies been completed when Ascyltos stole stealthily up to the
outside of the door and violently wrenching off the bars burst in upon
me toying with my brother  He filled the little room with his
laughter and hand-clapping pulled away the cloak which covered us What
are you up to now most sanctimoniousbrother'  he jeered  What's
going on here a blanket-wedding  Nor did he confine himself to words
but pulling the strap off his bag he began to lash me very thoroughly
interjecting sarcasms the while This is the way you would share with
your comrade is it  The unexpectedness of the thing compelled me to
endure the blows in silence and to put up with the abuse so I smiled at
my calamity and very prudently too as otherwise I should have been put
to the necessity of fighting with a rival  My pretended good humor
soothed his anger and at last Ascyltos smiled as well  See here
Encolpius he said are you so engrossed with your debaucheries that
you do not realize that our money is gone and that what we have left is
of no value  In the summer times are bad in the city  The country is
luckier let's go and visit our friends  Necessity compelled the
approval of this plan and the repression of any sense of injury as well
so loading Giton with our packs we left the city and hastened to the
country-seat of Lycurgus a Roman knight  Inasmuch as Ascyltos has
formerly served him in the capacity of brother he received us royally
and the company there assembled rendered our stay still more delightful
In the first place there was Tryphaena a most beautiful woman who had
come in company with Lycas the master of a vessel and owner of estates
near the seashore  Although Lycurgus kept a frugal table the pleasures
we enjoyed in this most enchanting spot cannot be described in words
Of course you know that Venus joined us all up as quickly as possible
The lovely Tryphaena pleased my taste and listened willingly to my vows
but hardly had I had time to enjoy her favors when Lycas in a towering
rage because his preserves had been secretly invaded demanded that I
indemnify him in her stead  She was an old flame of his so he broached
the subject of a mutual exchange of favors  Burning with lust he
pressed his suit but Tryphaena possessed my heart and I said Lycas nay
By refusal however he was only made more ardent followed me
everywhere entered my room at night and after his entreaties had met
with contempt he had recourse to violence against me at which I yelled
so lustily that I aroused the entire household and by the help of
Lycurgus I was delivered from the troublesome assault and escaped  At
last perceiving that the house of Lycurgus was not suitable to the
prosecution of his design he attempted to persuade me to seek his
hospitality and when his suggestion was refused he made use of
Tryphaena's influence over me  She besought me to comply with Lycas'
desires and she did this all the more readily as by that she hoped to
gain more liberty of action  With affairs in this posture I follow my
love but Lycurgus who had renewed his old relations with Ascyltos
would not permit him to leave so it was decided that he should remain
with Lycurgus but that we would accompany Lycas  Nevertheless we had
it understood among ourselves that whenever the opportunity presented
itself we would each pilfer whatever we could lay hands upon for the
betterment of the common stock  Lycas was highly delighted with my
acceptance of his invitation and hastened our departure so bidding our
friends good-bye we arrived at his place on the very same day  Lycas
had so arranged matters that on the journey he sat beside me while
Tryphaena was next to Giton the reason for this being his knowledge
of the woman's notorious inconstancy nor was he deceived for she
immediately fell in love with the boy and I easily perceived it
In addition Lycas took the trouble of calling my attention to the
situation and laid stress upon the truth of what we saw  On this
account I received his advances more graciously at which he was
overjoyed  He was certain that contempt would be engendered from the
inconstancy of my sister with the result that being piqued at
Tryphaena I would all the more freely receive his advances  Now this
was the state of affairs at the house of Lycas Tryphaena was desperately
in love with Giton Giton's whole soul was aflame for her neither of
them was a pleasing sight to my eyes and Lycas studying to please me
arranged novel entertainments each day which Doris his lovely wife
seconded to the best of her ability and so gracefully that she soon
expelled Tryphaena from my heart  A wink of the eye acquainted Doris of
my passion a coquettish glance informed me of the state of her heart
and this silent language anticipating the office of the tongue secretly
expressed that longing of our souls which we had both experienced at the
same instant  The jealousy of Lycas already well known to me was the
cause of my silence but love itself revealed to the wife the designs
which Lycas had upon me  At our first opportunity of exchanging
confidences she revealed to me what she had discovered and I candidly
confessed telling her of the coldness with which I had always met his
advances  The far-sighted woman remarked that it would be necessary for
us to use our wits  It turned out that her advice was sound for I soon
found out that complacency to the one meant possession of the other
Giton in the meantime was recruiting his exhausted strength and
Tryphaena turned her attention to me but meeting with a repulse she
flounced out in a rage  The next thing this burning harlot did was to
discover my commerce with both husband and wife  As for his wantonness
with me she flung that aside as by it she lost nothing but she fell
upon the secret gratifications of Doris and made them known to Lycas
who his jealousy proving stronger than his lust took steps to get
revenge  Doris however forewarned by Tryphaena's maid looked out
for squalls and held aloof from any secret assignations  When I became
aware of all this I heartily cursed the perfidy of Tryphaena and the
ungrateful soul of Lycas and made up my mind to be gone  Fortune
favored me as it turned out for a vessel sacred to Isis and laden with
prize-money had only the day before run upon the rocks in the vicinity
After holding a consultation with Giton at which he gladly gave consent
to my plan as Tryphaena visibly neglected him after having sapped his
virility we hastened to the sea-shore early on the following morning
and boarded the wreck a thing easy of accomplishment as the watchmen
who were in the pay of Lycas knew us well  But they were so attentive
to us that there was no opportunity of stealing a thing until having
left Giton with them I craftily slipped out of sight and sneaked aft
where the statue of Isis stood and despoiled it of a valuable mantle and
a silver sistrum  From the master's cabin I also pilfered other
valuable trifles and stealthily sliding down a rope went ashore  Giton
was the only one who saw me and he evaded the watchmen and slipped away
after me  I showed him the plunder when he joined me and we decided
to post with all speed to Ascyltos but we did not arrive at the home of
Lycurgus until the following day  In a few words I told Ascyltos of the
robbery when he joined us and of our unfortunate love-affairs as well
He was for prepossessing the mind of Lycurgus in our favor naming the
increasing wantonness of Lycas as the cause of our secret and sudden
change of habitation  When Lycurgus had heard everything he swore
that he would always be a tower of strength between us and our enemies
Until Tryphaena and Doris were awake and out of bed our flight remained
undiscovered for we paid them the homage of a daily attendance at the
morning toilette  When our unwonted absence was noted Lycas sent out
runners to comb the sea-shore for he suspected that we had been to the
wreck but he was still unaware of the robbery which was yet unknown
because the stern of the wreck was lying away from the beach and the
master had not as yet gone back aboard  Lycas flew into a towering
rage when our flight was established for certain and railed bitterly at
Doris whom he considered as the moving factor in it  Of the hard words
and the beating he gave her I will say nothing for the particulars are
not known to me but I will affirm that Tryphaena who was the sole cause
of the unpleasantness persuaded Lycas to hunt for his fugitives in the
house of Lycurgus which was our most probable sanctuary  She
volunteered to accompany him in person so that she could load us with
the abuse which we deserved at her hands  They set out on the following
day and arrived at the estate of Lycurgus but we were not there for he
had taken us to a neighboring town to attend the feast of Hercules which
was there being celebrated  As soon as they found out about this they
hastened to take to the road and ran right into us in the portico of the
temple  At sight of them we were greatly put out and Lycas held forth
violently to Lycurgus upon the subject of our flight but he was met
with raised eyebrows and such a scowling forehead that I plucked up
courage and in a loud voice passed judgment upon his lewd and base
attempts and assaults upon me not in the house of Lycurgus alone but
even under his own roof and as for the meddling Tryphaena she received
her just deserts for at great length I described her moral turpitude
to the crowd our altercation had caused a mob to collect and to give
weight to my argument I pointed to limber-hamed Giton drained dry as
it were and to myself reduced almost to skin and bones by the raging
lust of that nymphomaniac harlot  So humiliated were our enemies by the
guffaws of the mob that in gloomy ill-humor they beat a retreat to plot
revenge  As they perceived that we had prepossessed the mind of Lycurgus
in our favor they decided to await his return at his estate in order
that they might wean him away from his misapprehension  As the
solemnities did not draw to a close until late at night we could not
reach Lycurguscountry place so he conducted us to a villa of his
situated near the halfway point of the journey and leaving us to sleep
there until the next day he set off for his estate for the purpose of
transacting some business  Upon his arrival he found Lycas and
Tryphaena awaiting him and they stated their case so diplomatically that
they prevailed upon him to deliver us into their hands  Lycurgus cruel
by nature and incapable of keeping his word was by this time striving to
hit upon the best method of betraying us and to that end he persuaded
Lycas to go for help while he himself returned to the villa and had us
put under guard  To the villa he came and greeted us with a scowl as
black as any Lycas himself had ever achieved clenching his fists again
and again he charged us with having lied about Lycas and turning
Ascyltos out he gave orders that we were to be kept confined to the room
in which we had retired to rest  Nor would he hear a word in our
defense from Ascyltos but taking the latter with him he returned to
his estate reiterating his orders relative to our confinement which was
to last until his return  On the way back Ascyltos vainly essayed to
break down Lycurgusdetermination but neither prayers nor caresses nor
even tears could move him  Thereupon my brother conceived the design
of freeing us from our chains and antagonized by the stubbornness of
Lycurgus he positively refused to sleep with him and through this he
was in a better position to carry out the plan which he had thought out
When the entire household was buried in its first sleep Ascyltos loaded
our little packs upon his back and slipped out through a breach in the
wall which he had previously noted arriving at the villa with the dawn
He gained entrance without opposition and found his way to our room
which the guards had taken the precaution to bar  It was easy to force
an entrance as the fastening was made of wood which same he pried off
with a piece of iron  The fall of the lock roused us for we were
snoring away in spite of our unfortunate situation  On account of the
long vigil the guard was in such a deep sleep that we alone were wakened
by the crashing fall of the lock and Ascyltos coming in told us in a
few words what he had done for us but as far as that goes not many were
necessary  We were hurriedly dressing when I was seized with the notion
of killing the guard and stripping the place  This plan I confided to
Ascyltos who approved of the looting but pointed out a more desirable
solution without bloodshed knowing all the crooks and turns as he did
he led us to a store-room which he opened  We gathered up all that was
of value and sallied forth while it was yet early in the morning
Shunning the public roads we could not rest until we believed ourselves
safe from pursuit  Ascyltos when he had caught his breath gloatingly
exulted of the pleasure which the looting of a villa belonging to
Lycurgus a superlatively avaricious man afforded him he complained
with justice of his parsimony affirming that he himself had received no
reward for his k-nightly services that he had been kept at a dry table
and on a skimpy ration of food  This Lycurgus was so stingy that he
denied himself even the necessities of life his immense wealth to the
contrary notwithstanding

The tortured Tantalus still stands to parch in his shifting pool

And starve when fruit sways just beyond his grasp

The image of the miser rich when his avaricious soul

Robs him of food and drink in Plenty's clasp

Ascyltos was for going to Naples that same day but I protested the
imprudence of going to any place where they would be on the lookout for
us  Let's absent ourselves for a while and travel in the country  We
are well supplied with means  This advice took his fancy and we set out
for a part of the country noted for the beauty of its estates and where
not a few of our acquaintances were enjoying the sports of the season
Scarcely had we covered half the distance however before it began to
pour down rain by the bucketful compelling us to run for the nearest
village  Upon entering the inn we noticed many other wayfarers who had
put up there to escape the storm  The jam prevented our being watched
and at the same time made it easier for us to pry about with curious
eyes on the alert for something to appropriate  Ascyltos unseen by
anyone picked up off the ground a little pouch in which he found some
gold pieces  We were overjoyed with this auspicious beginning but
fearing that some one would miss the gold we stealthily slipped out by
the back door  A slave who was saddling a horse in the courtyard
suddenly left his work and went into the house as if he had forgotten
something and while he was gone I appropriated a superb mantle which was
tied fast to the saddle by untying the thongs then utilizing a row of
outbuildings for cover we made off into the nearest wood  When we had
reached the depths of the grove where we were in safety we thoroughly
discussed the surest method of secreting our gold so that we would
neither be accused of robbery nor robbed ourselves and we finally
decided to sew it into the hem of a ragged tunic which I threw over my
shoulders after having turned the mantle over to Ascyltos for
safekeeping we then made ready to start for the city via the
unfrequented roads  We were just about to emerge from the shelter of
the wood when we heard from somewhere on our left They can't get away
they came into this wood let's spread out and beat and they will easily
be caught  On hearing this we were thrown into such a terrible fright
that Ascyltos and Giton dashed away city-ward through the underbrush
and I retreated in such a hurry that the precious tunic slipped off my
shoulders without my knowing it  At last completely fagged out and
unable to take another step I lay down under a tree and there I first
became aware of the loss of the tunic  Chagrin restored my strength and
I leaped to my feet to look for the treasure and for a long time I beat
around in vain  Worn out with work and vexation I forced my way into
the thickest part of the grove and remained there for four mortal hours
but at last bored to extinction by the horrible solitude I sought a way
out  As I went ahead I caught sight of a peasant then I had need of
all my nerve and it did not fail me  Marching boldly up to him I asked
my way to the city complaining that I had been lost in the wood for
several hours  Seeing my condition he took pity upon me for I was
covered with mud and paler than death and asked me whether I had seen
anyone in the place  Not a soul I replied whereupon he kindly
conducted me to the high road where he met two of his companions who
informed him that they had beaten along every path in the forest without
having found anything except a tunic which they showed him  As may be
readily supposed I did not have the audacity to claim it though well
aware of its value and my chagrin became almost insupportable as I
vented many a groaning curse over my lost treasure  The peasants paid
no attention to me and I was gradually left behind as my weakness
increased my pace decreased  For this reason it was late when I reached
the city and entering the inn beheld Ascyltos stretched out half
dead upon a cot  Too far gone to utter a single syllable I threw
myself upon another  Ascyltos became greatly excited at not seeing the
tunic which he had entrusted to me demanding it insistently but I was
so weak that my voice refused its office and I permitted the apathy of my
eyes to answer his demand then by and by regaining my strength little
by little I related the whole affair to Ascyltos in every detail  He
thought that I was joking and although my testimony was fortified by a
copious flood of tears it could easily be seen that he remained
unconvinced believing that I wanted to cheat him out of the gold
Giton who was standing by during all this was as downcast as myself
and the suffering of the lad only served to increase my own vexation but
the thing which bothered me most of all was the painstaking search which
was being made for us I told Ascyltos of this but he only laughed it
off as he had so happily extricated himself from the scrape  He was
convinced that as we were unknown and as no one had seen us we were
perfectly safe  We decided nevertheless to feign sickness and to keep
to our room as long as possible but before we knew it our money ran
out and spurred by necessity we were forced to go abroad and sell some
of our plunder




CHAPTER THE TWELFTH

Twilight was falling as we entered the market-place in which we noticed
a quantity of things for sale not any of much value it is true but
such as could be disposed of to the best advantage when the semi-darkness
would serve to hide their doubtful origin  As we had brought our stolen
mantle we proceeded to make use of so favorable an opportunity and in
a secluded spot displayed a corner of it hoping the splendid garment
would attract some purchaser  Nor was it long before a certain peasant
whose face was familiar to my eyes came up accompanied by a young
woman and began to examine the garment very closely  Ascyltos in turn
cast a glance at the shoulders of our rustic customer and was instantly
struck dumb with astonishment  Nor could I myself look upon this man
without some emotion for he seemed to be the identical person who had
picked up the ragged tunic in the lonely wood and as a matter of fact
he was  Ascyltos afraid to believe the evidence of his own eyes for
fear of doing something rash approached the man as a prospective buyer
took the hem of the tunic from the rustic's shoulders and felt it
thoroughly




CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH

Oh wonderful stroke of Fortune  The peasant had not yet laid his
meddling hands upon the seams but was scornfully offering the thing for
sale as though it had been the leavings of some beggar  When Ascyltos
had assured himself that the hoard was intact and had taken note of the
social status of the seller he led me a little aside from the crowd and
said Do you knowbrotherthat the treasure about which I was so
worked up has come back to us  That is the little tunic and it seems
that the gold pieces are still untouched  What ought we to do and how
shall we make good our claim  I was overjoyed not so much at seeing
our booty as I was for the reason that Fortune had released me from a
very ugly suspicion  I was opposed to doing anything by devious methods
thinking that should he prove unwilling to restore to the proper owner an
article not his own it ought to come to a civil action and a judgment
secured




CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH

Not so Ascyltos who was afraid of the law and demurred Who knows us
here  Who will place any credence in anything we say  It seems to me
that it would be better to buy ours though it is and we know it and
recover the treasure at small cost rather than to engage in a doubtful
lawsuit

Of what avail are any laws where money rules alone

Where Poverty can never win its cases

Detractors of the times who bear the Cynic's scrip are known

To often sell the truth and keep their faces

So Justice is at public auction bought

The knight gives judgement as Gold says he ought

But with the exception of a two-as piece with which we had intended
purchasing peas and lupines there was nothing to hand so for fear our
loot should escape us in the interim we resolved to appraise the mantle
at less and through a small sacrifice secure a greater profit
Accordingly we spread it out and the young woman of the covered head
who was standing by the peasant's side narrowly inspected the markings
seized the hem with both hands and screamed Thieves at the top of her
voice  We were greatly disconcerted at this and for fear that
inactivity on our part should seem to lend color to her charges we
laid hold of the dirty ragged tunic in our turn and shouted with equal
spite that this was our property which they had in their possession but
our cases were by no means on an equality and the hucksters who had
crowded around us at the uproar laughed at our spiteful claim and very
naturally too since one side laid claim to a very valuable mantle
while the other demanded a rag which was not worth a good patch




CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH

Ascyltos when he had secured silence adroitly put a stop to their
laughter by exclaiming We can see that each puts the greater value upon
his own property  Let them return our tunic to us and take back their
mantle  This exchange was satisfactory enough to the peasant and the
young woman but some night-prowling shyster lawyers who wished to get
possession of the mantle for their own profit demanded that both
articles be deposited with them and the judge could look into the case
on the morrow for it would appear that the ownership of the articles was
not so much to the point as was the suspicion of robbery that attached
to both sides  The question of sequestration arose and one of the
hucksters I do not remember which but he was bald and his forehead was
covered with sebaceous wens and he sometimes did odd jobs for the
lawyers seized the mantle and vowed that HE would see to it that it was
produced at the proper time and place but it was easily apparent that he
desired nothing but that the garment should be deposited with thieves
and vanish thinking that we would be afraid to appear as claimants for
fear of being charged with crime  As far as we were concerned we were
as willing as he and Fortune aided the cause of each of us for the
peasant infuriated at our demand that his rags be shown in public threw
the tunic in Ascyltosface released us from responsibility and
demanded that the mantle which was the only object of litigation be
sequestered  As we thought we had recovered our treasure we returned
hurriedly to the inn and fastening the door we had a good laugh at the
shrewdness of the hucksters and not less so at that of our enemies for
by it they had returned our money to us  While we were unstitching the
tunic to get at the gold pieces we overheard some one quizzing the
innkeeper as to what kind of people those were who had just entered his
house  Alarmed at this inquiry I went down when the questioner had
gone to find out what was the matter and learned that the praetor's
lictor whose duty it was to see that the names of strangers were entered
in his rolls had seen two people come into the inn whose names were not
yet entered and that was the reason he had made inquiry as to their
names and means of support  Mine host furnished this information in such
an offhand manner that I became suspicious as to our entire safety in his
house so in order to avoid arrest we decided to go out and not to
return home until after dark and we sallied forth leaving the
management of dinner to Giton  As it suited our purpose to avoid the
public streets we strolled through the more unfrequented parts of the
city and just at dusk we met two women in stolas in a lonely spot and
they were by no means homely  Walking softly we followed them to a
temple which they entered and from which we could hear a curious
humming which resembled the sound of voices issuing from the depths of a
cavern  Curiosity impelled us also to enter the temple  There we caught
sight of many women who resembled Bacchantes each of whom brandished in
her right hand an emblem of Priapus  We were not permitted to see more
for as their eyes fell upon us they raised such a hubbub that the vault
of the temple trembled  They attempted to lay hands upon us but we ran
back to our inn as fast as we could go




CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH

We had just disposed of the supper prepared by Giton when there came a
timid rapping at the door  We turned pale  Who is there  we asked
Open and you will find out came the answer  While we were speaking
the bar fell down of its own accord the doors flew open and admitted our
visitor  She was the selfsame young lady of the covered head who had but
a little while before stood by the peasant's side  So you thought
said she that you could make a fool of me did you  I am Quartilla's
handmaid Quartilla whose rites you interrupted in the shrine  She has
come to the inn in person and begs permission to speak with you  Don't
be alarmed  She neither blames your mistake nor does she demand
punishment on the contrary she wonders what god has brought such
well-bred young gentlemen into her neighborhood




CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH

We were still holding our tongues and refraining from any expression of
opinion when the lady herself entered the room attended by a little
girl  Seating herself upon the bed she wept for a long time  Not even
then did we interject a single word but waited all attention for what
was to follow these well ordered tears and this show of grief  When the
diplomatic thunderstorm had passed over she withdrew her haughty head
from her mantle and ringing her hands until the joints cracked What is
the meaning of such audacity she demanded where did you learn such
tricks  They are worthy of putting to shame the assurance of all the
robbers of the past  I pity you so help me the God of Truth I do for
no one can look with impunity upon that which it is unlawful for him to
see  In our neighborhood there are so many gods that it is easier to
meet one than it is to find a man  But do not think that I was actuated
by any desire for revenge when I came here I am more moved by your age
than I am by my own injury for it is my belief that youthful imprudence
led you into committing a sacrilegious crime  That very night I tossed
so violently in the throes of a dangerous chill that I was afraid I had
contracted a tertian ague and in my dreams I prayed for a medicine  I
was ordered to seek you out and to arrest the progress of the disease by
means of an expedient to be suggested by your wonderful penetration  The
cure does not matter so much however for a deeper grief gnaws at my
vitals and drags me down almost to the very doors of death itself  I am
afraid that with the careless impulsiveness of youth you may divulge
to the common herd what you witnessed in the shrine of Priapus and
reveal the rites of the gods to the rabble  On this account I stretch
out my suppliant hands to your knees and beg and pray that you do not
make a mockery and a joke of our nocturnal rites nor lay bare the
secrets of so many years into which scarcely a thousand persons are
initiated




CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH

The tears poured forth again after this appeal and shaken by deep
sobs she buried her whole face and breast in my bed and I moved by
pity and by apprehension begged her to be of good cheer and to make
herself perfectly easy as to both of those issues for not only would we
not betray any secrets to the rabble but we would also second divine
providence at any peril to ourselves if any god had indicated to her
any cure for her tertian ague  The woman cheered up at this promise and
smothered me with kisses from tears she passed to laughter and fell to
running her fingers through the long hair that hung down about my ears
I will declare a truce with you she said and withdraw my complaint
But had you been unwilling to administer the medicine which I seek I had
a troop in readiness for the morrow which would have exacted
satisfaction for my injury and reparation for my dignity

To be flouted is disgraceful but to dictate terms sublime

Pleased am I to choose what course I will

Even sages will retort an insult at the proper tune

Victor most is he who does not kill

Then she suddenly clapped her hands and broke into such a peal of
laughter that we were alarmed  The maid who had been the first to
arrive did likewise on one side of us as also did the little girl who
had entered with the madame herself




CHAPTER THE NINETEENTH

The whole place was filled with mocking laughter and we who could see
no reason for such a change of front stared blankly at each other and
then at the women  Then Quartilla spoke up finally I gave orders
that no mortal man should be admitted into this inn this day so that I
could receive the treatment for my ague without interruption  Ascyltos
was for the moment struck dumb by this admission of Quartilla's and I
turned colder than a Gallic winter and could not utter a word but the
personnel of the company relieved me from the fear that the worst might
be yet to come for they were only three young women too weak to attempt
any violence against us who were of the male sex at least even if we
had nothing else of the man about us and this was an asset  Then too
we were girded higher and I had so arranged matters that if it came to a
fight I would engage Quartilla myself Ascyltos the maid and Giton the
girl  While I was turning over this plan in my mind Quartilla came to
close quarters to receive the treatment for her ague but having her
hopes disappointed she flounced out in a rage and returning in a little
while she had us overpowered by some unknown vagabonds and gave orders
for us to be carried away to a splendid palace  Then our determination
gave place to astonishment and death sure and certain began to obscure
the eyes of suffering




CHAPTER THE TWENTIETH

Pray madame I groaned if you have anything worse in store bring it
on quickly for we have not committed a crime so heinous as to merit death
by torture  The maid whose name was Psyche quickly spread a blanket
upon the floor and sought to secure an erection by fondling my member
which was already a thousand times colder than death  Ascyltos well
aware by now of the danger of dipping into the secrets of others covered
his head with his mantle  In the meantime the maid took two ribbons
from her bosom and bound our feet with one and our hands with the other
Finding myself trussed up in this fashion I remarked You will not be
able to cure your mistressague in this manner  Granted the maid
replied but I have other and surer remedies at hand she brought me a
vessel full of satyrion as she said this and so cheerfully did she
gossip about its virtues that I drank down nearly all of the liquor and
because Ascyltos had but a moment before rejected her advances she
sprinkled the dregs upon his back without his knowing it  When this
repartee had drawn to a close Ascyltos exclaimed Don't I deserve a
drink  Given away by my laughter the maid clapped her hands and cried
I put one by you young man did you drink so much all by yourself
What's that you say Quartilla chimed in  Did Encolpius drink all
the satyrion there was in the house  And she laughed delightfully until
her sides shook  Finally not even Giton himself could resist a smile
especially when the little girl caught him around the neck and showered
innumerable kisses upon him and he not at all averse to it




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST

We would have cried aloud in our misery but there was no one to give us
any help and whenever I attempted to shout Help  all honest
citizens Psyche would prick my cheeks with her hairpin and the little
girl would intimidate Ascyltos with a brush dipped in satyrion  Then a
catamite appeared clad in a myrtle-colored frieze robe and girded round
with a belt  One minute he nearly gored us to death with his writhing
buttocks and the next he befouled us so with his stinking kisses that
Quartilla with her robe tucked high held up her whalebone wand and
ordered him to give the unhappy wretches quarter  Both of us then took a
most solemn oath that so dread a secret should perish with us  Several
wrestling instructors appeared and refreshed us worn out as we were by
a massage with pure oil and when our fatigue had abated we again donned
our dining clothes and were escorted to the next room in which were
placed three couches and where all the essentials necessary to a
splendid banquet were laid out in all their richness  We took our
places as requested and began with a wonderful first course  We were
all but submerged in Falernian wine  When several other courses had
followed and we were endeavoring to keep awake Quartilla exclaimed How
dare you think of going to sleep when you know that the vigil of Priapus
is to be kept




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND

Worn out by all his troubles Ascyltos commenced to nod and the maid
whom he had slighted and of course insulted smeared lampblack all over
his face and painted his lips and shoulders with vermillion while he
drowsed  Completely exhausted by so many untoward adventures I too
was enjoying the shortest of naps the whole household within and
without was doing the same some were lying here and there asleep at our
feet others leaned against the walls and some even slept head to head
upon the threshold itself the lamps failing because of a lack of oil
shed a feeble and flickering light when two Syrians bent upon stealing
an amphora of wine entered the dining-room  While they were greedily
pawing among the silver they pulled the amphora in two upsetting the
table with all the silver plate and a cup which had flown pretty high
cut the head of the maid who was drowsing upon a couch  She screamed at
that thereby betraying the thieves and wakening some of the drunkards
The Syrians who had come for plunder seeing that they were about to be
detected were so quick to throw themselves down besides a couch and
commence to snore as if they had been asleep for a long time that you
would have thought they belonged there  The butler had gotten up and
poured oil in the flickering lamps by this time and the boys having
rubbed their eyes open had returned to their duty when in came a female
cymbal player and the crashing brass awoke everybody




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-THIRD

The banquet began all over again and Quartilla challenged us to a
drinking-bout the crash of the cymbals lending ardor to her revel
A catamite appeared the stalest of all mankind well worthy of that
house  Heaving a sigh he wrung his hands until the joints cracked
and spouted out the following verses

Hither hither quickly gather pathic companions boon
Artfully stretch forth your limbs and on with the dance and play
Twinkling feet and supple thighs and agile buttocks in tune
Hands well skilled in raising passions Delian eunuchs gay

When he had finished his poetry he slobbered a most evil-smelling kiss
upon me and then climbing upon my couch he proceeded with all his
might and main to pull all of my clothing off  I resisted to the limit
of my strength  He manipulated my member for a long time but all in
vain  Gummy streams poured down his sweating forehead and there was so
much chalk in the wrinkles of his cheeks that you might have mistaken his
face for a roofless wall from which the plaster was crumbling in a rain




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH

Driven to the last extremity I could no longer keep back the tears
Madame I burst out is this the night-cap which you ordered served to
me  Clapping her hands softly she cried out Oh you witty rogue you
are a fountain of repartee but you never knew before that a catamite was
called a k-night-cap now did you Then fearing my companion would come
off better than I Madame I said I leave it to your sense of
fairness is Ascyltos to be the only one in this dining-room who keeps
holiday  Fair enough conceded Quartilla let Ascyltos have his
k-night-cap too  On hearing that the catamite changed mounts and
having bestridden my comrade nearly drove him to distraction with his
buttocks and his kisses  Giton was standing between us and splitting his
sides with laughter when Quartilla noticed him and actuated by the
liveliest curiosity she asked whose boy he was and upon my answering
that he was my brother  Why has he not kissed me then  she
demanded  Calling him to her she pressed a kiss upon his mouth then
putting her hand beneath his robe she took hold of his little member as
yet so undeveloped  This she remarked shall serve me very well
tomorrow as a whet to my appetite but today I'll take no common fare
after choice fish




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH

She was still talking when Psyche who was giggling came to her side and
whispered something in her ear  What it was I did not catch  By all
means ejaculated Quartilla a brilliant idea  Why shouldn't our
pretty little Pannychis lose her maidenhead when the opportunity is so
favorable  A little girl pretty enough too was led in at once she
looked to be not over seven years of age and she was the same one who
had before accompanied Quartilla to our room  Amidst universal applause
and in response to the demands of all they made ready to perform the
nuptial rites  I was completely out of countenance and insisted that
such a modest boy as Giton was entirely unfitted for such a wanton part
and moreover that the child was not of an age at which she could receive
that which a woman must take  Is that so Quartilla scoffed is she
any younger than I was when I submitted to my first man  Juno my
patroness curse me if I can remember the time when I ever was a virgin
for I diverted myself with others of my own age as a child then as the
years passed I played with bigger boys until at last I reached my
present age  I suppose that this explains the origin of the proverb
'Who carried the calf may carry the bullas they say  As I feared
that Giton might run greater risk if I were absent I got up to take
part in the ceremony




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH

Psyche had already enveloped the child's head in the bridal-veil the
catamite holding a torch led the long procession of drunken women which
followed they were clapping their hands having previously decked out
the bridal-bed with a suggestive drapery  Quartilla spurred on by the
wantonness of the others seized hold of Giton and drew him into the
bridal-chamber  There was no doubt of the boy's perfect willingness to
go nor was the girl at all alarmed at the name of marriage  When they
were finally in bed and the door shut we seated ourselves outside the
door of the bridal-chamber and Quartilla applied a curious eye to a
chink purposely made watching their childish dalliance with lascivious
attention  She then drew me gently over to her side that I might share
the spectacle with her and when we both attempted to peep our faces were
pressed against each other whenever she was not engrossed in the
performance she screwed up her lips to meet mine and pecked at me
continually with furtive kisses  A thunderous hammering was heard at
the door while all this was going on and everyone wondered what this
unexpected interruption could mean when we saw a soldier one of the
night-watch enter with a drawn sword in his hand and surrounded by a
crowd of young rowdies  He glared about him with savage eyes and
blustering mien and catching sight of Quartilla presently What's up
now you shameless woman he bawled what do you mean by making game of
me with lying promises and cheating me out of the night you promised me
But you won't get off unpunished You and that lover of yours are going to
find out that I'm a man  At the soldier's orders his companion bound
Quartilla and myself together mouth to mouth breast to breast and
thigh to thigh and not without a great deal of laughter  Then the
catamite also at the soldier's order began to beslaver me all over with
the fetid kisses of his stinking mouth a treatment I could neither fly
from nor in any other way avoid  Finally he ravished me and worked
his entire pleasure upon me  In the meantime the satyrion which I had
drunk only a little while before spurred every nerve to lust and I began
to gore Quartilla impetuously and she burning with the same passion
reciprocated in the game  The rowdies laughed themselves sick so moved
were they by that ludicrous scene for here was I mounted by the stalest
of catamites involuntarily and almost unconsciously responding with as
rapid a cadence to him as Quartilla did in her wriggling under me  While
this was going on Pannychis unaccustomed at her tender years to the
pastime of Venus raised an outcry and attracted the attention of the
soldier by this unexpected howl of consternation for this slip of a
girl was being ravished and Giton the victor had won a not bloodless
victory  Aroused by what he saw the soldier rushed upon them seizing
Pannychis then Giton then both of them together in a crushing embrace
The virgin burst into tears and plead with him to remember her age but
her prayers availed her nothing the soldier only being fired the more by
her childish charms  Pannychis covered her head at last resolved to
endure whatever the Fates had in store for her  At this instant an old
woman the very same who had tricked me on that day when I was hunting
for our lodging came to the aid of Pannychis as though she had dropped
from the clouds  With loud cries she rushed into the house swearing
that a gang of footpads was prowling about the neighborhood and the
people invoked the help of All honest men in vain for the members of
the night-watch were either asleep or intent upon some carouse as they
were nowhere to be found  Greatly terrified at this the soldier rushed
headlong from Quartilla's house  His companions followed after him
freeing Pannychis from impending danger and relieving the rest of us from
our fear  I was so weary of Quartilla's lechery that I began to
meditate means of escape  I made my intentions known to Ascyltos who
as he wished to rid himself of the importunities of Psyche was
delighted had not Giton been shut up in the bridal-chamber the plan
would have presented no difficulties but we wished to take him with us
and out of the way of the viciousness of these prostitutes  We were
anxiously engaged in debating this very point when Pannychis fell out of
bed and dragged Giton after her by her own weight  He was not hurt
but the girl gave her head a slight bump and raised such a clamor that
Quartilla in a terrible fright rushed headlong into the room giving us
the opportunity of making off  We did not tarry but flew back to our
inn where throwing ourselves upon the bed we passed the remainder of
the night without fear  Sallying forth next day we came upon two of
our kidnappers one of whom Ascyltos savagely attacked the moment he set
eyes upon him and after having thrashed and seriously wounded him
he ran to my aid against the other  He defended himself so stoutly
however that he wounded us both slightly and escaped unscathed  The
third day had now dawned the date set for the free dinner at
Trimalchio's but battered as we were flight seemed more to our taste
than quiet so we hastened to our inn and as our wounds turned out to
be trifling we dressed them with vinegar and oil and went to bed  The
ruffian whom we had done for was still lying upon the ground and we
feared detection  Affairs were at this pass and we were framing
melancholy excuses with which to evade the coming revel when a slave of
Agamemnon's burst in upon our trembling conclave and said Don't you
know with whom your engagement is today  The exquisite Trimalchio who
keeps a clock and a liveried bugler in his dining-room so that he can
tell instantly how much of his life has run out  Forgetting all our
troubles at that we dressed hurriedly and ordered Giton who had very
willingly performed his servile office to follow us to the bath

VOLUME 2 THE DINNER OF TRIMALCHIO


CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SEVENTH

Having put on our clothes in the meantime we commenced to stroll around
and soon the better to amuse ourselves approached the circle of
players all of a sudden we caught sight of a bald-headed old fellow
rigged out in a russet colored tunic playing ball with some long haired
boys  It was not so much the boys who attracted our attention although
they might well have merited it as it was the spectacle afforded by this
beslippered paterfamilias playing with a green ball  If one but touched
the ground he never stooped for it to put it back in play for a slave
stood by with a bagful from which the players were supplied  We noted
other innovations as well for two eunuchs were stationed at opposite
sides of the ring one of whom held a silver chamber-pot the other
counted the balls not those which bounced back and forth from hand to
hand in play but those which fell to the ground  While we were
marveling at this display of refinement Menelaus rushed up He is the
one with whom you will rest upon your elbow he panted what you see
now is only a prelude to the dinner  Menelaus had scarcely ceased
speaking when Trimalchio snapped his fingers the eunuch hearing the
signal held the chamber-pot for him while he still continued playing
After relieving his bladder he called for water to wash his hands
barely moistened his fingers and dried them upon a boy's head




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH

To go into details would take too long  We entered the bath finally
and after sweating for a minute or two in the warm room we passed
through into the cold water  But short as was the time Trimalchio had
already been sprinkled with perfume and was being rubbed down not with
linen towels however but with cloths made from the finest wool
Meanwhile three masseurs were guzzling Falernian under his eyes and
when they spilled a great deal of it in their brawling Trimalchio
declared they were pouring a libation to his Genius  He was then wrapped
in a coarse scarlet wrap-rascal and placed in a litter Four runners
whose liveries were decorated with metal plates preceded him as also
did a wheel-chair in which rode his favorite a withered blear eyed
slave even more repulsive looking than his master  A singing boy
approached the head of his litter as he was being carried along and
played upon small pipes the whole way just as if he were communicating
some secret to his master's ear  Marveling greatly we followed and met
Agamemnon at the outer door to the post of which was fastened a small
tablet bearing this inscription

NO SLAVE TO LEAVE THE PREMISES
WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE MASTER
PENALTY ONE HUNDRED LASHES

In the vestibule stood the porter clad in green and girded with a
cherry-colored belt shelling peas into a silver dish  Above the
threshold was suspended a golden cage from which a black and white
magpie greeted the visitors




CHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH

I almost fell backwards and broke my legs while staring at all this for
to the left as we entered not far from the porter's alcove an enormous
dog upon a chain was painted upon the wall and above him this
inscription in capitals

BEWARE THE DOG

My companions laughed but I plucked up my courage and did not hesitate
but went on and examined the entire wall  There was a scene in a slave
market the tablets hanging from the slavesnecks and Trimalchio
himself wearing his hair long holding a caduceus in his hand entering
Rome led by the hand of Minerva  Then again the painstaking artist had
depicted him casting up accounts and still again being appointed
steward everything being explained by inscriptions  Where the walls
gave way to the portico Mercury was shown lifting him up by the chin
to a tribunal placed on high  Near by stood Fortune with her horn of
plenty and the three Fates spinning golden flax  I also took note of a
group of runners in the portico taking their exercise under the eye of
an instructor and in one corner was a large cabinet in which was a very
small shrine containing silver Lares a marble Venus and a golden casket
by no means small which held so they told us the first shavings of
Trimalchio's beard  I asked the hall-porter what pictures were in the
middle hall  The Iliad and the Odyssey he replied and the
gladiatorial games given under Laenas  There was no time in which to
examine them all




CHAPTER THE THIRTIETH

We had now come to the dining-room at the entrance to which sat a
factor receiving accounts and what gave me cause for astonishment
rods and axes were fixed to the door-posts superimposed as it were
upon the bronze beak of a ship whereon was inscribed

TO GAIUS POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO
AUGUSTAL SEVIR
FROM CINNAMUS HIS
STEWARD

A double lamp suspended from the ceiling hung beneath the inscription
and a tablet was fixed to each door-post one if my memory serves me
was inscribed

ON DECEMBER THIRTIETH AND
THIRTY FIRST
OUR
GAIUS DINES OUT

the other bore a painting of the moon in her phases and the seven
planets and the days which were lucky and those which were unlucky
distinguished by distinctive studs  We had had enough of these novelties
and started to enter the dining-room when a slave detailed to this duty
cried out Right foot first  Naturally we were afraid that some of us
might break some rule of conduct and cross the threshold the wrong way
nevertheless we started out stepping off together with the right foot
when all of a sudden a slave who had been stripped threw himself at our
feet and commenced begging us to save him from punishment as it was no
serious offense for which he was in jeopardy the steward's clothing had
been stolen from him in the baths and the whole value could scarcely
amount to ten sesterces  So we drew back our right feet and intervened
with the steward who was counting gold pieces in the hall begging him
to remit the slave's punishment  Putting a haughty face on the matter
It's not the loss I mind so much he said as it is the carelessness
of this worthless rascal  He lost my dinner clothes given me on my
birthday they were by a certain client Tyrian purple too but it had
been washed once already  But what does it amount to  I make you a
present of the scoundrel




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST

We felt deeply obligated by his great condescension and the same
slave for whom we had interceded rushed up to us as we entered the
dining-room and to our astonishment kissed us thick and fast voicing
his thanks for our kindness  You'll know in a minute whom you did a
favor for he confided the master's wine is the thanks of a grateful
butler  At length we reclined and slave boys from Alexandria poured
water cooled with snow upon our hands while others following attended
to our feet and removed the hangnails with wonderful dexterity nor were
they silent even during this disagreeable operation but they all kept
singing at their work  I was desirous of finding out whether the whole
household could sing so I ordered a drink a boy near at hand instantly
repeated my order in a singsong voice fully as shrill and whichever one
you accosted did the same  You would not imagine that this was the
dining-room of a private gentleman but rather that it was an exhibition
of pantomimes  A very inviting relish was brought on for by now all the
couches were occupied save only that of Trimalchio for whom after a new
custom the chief place was reserved

On the tray stood a donkey made of Corinthian bronze bearing panniers
containing olives white in one and black in the other  Two platters
flanked the figure on the margins of which were engraved Trimalchio's
name and the weight of the silver in each  Dormice sprinkled with
poppy-seed and honey were served on little bridges soldered fast to the
platter and hot sausages on a silver gridiron underneath which were
damson plums and pomegranate seeds




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SECOND

We Were in the midst of these delicacies when to the sound of music
Trimalchio himself was carried in and bolstered up in a nest of small
cushions which forced a snicker from the less wary  A shaven poll
protruded from a scarlet mantle and around his neck already muffled
with heavy clothing he had tucked a napkin having a broad purple stripe
and a fringe that hung down all around  On the little finger of his left
hand he wore a massive gilt ring and on the first joint of the next
finger a smaller one which seemed to me to be of pure gold but as a
matter of fact it had iron stars soldered on all around it  And then
for fear all of his finery would not be displayed he bared his right
arm adorned with a golden arm-band and an ivory circlet clasped with a
plate of shining metal




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-THIRD

Picking his teeth with a silver quill Friends said he it was not
convenient for me to come into the dining-room just yet but for fear my
absence should cause you any inconvenience I gave over my own pleasure
permit me however to finish my game  A slave followed with a
terebinth table and crystal dice and I noted one piece of luxury that
was superlative for instead of black and white pieces he used gold and
silver coins  He kept up a continual flow of various coarse expressions
We were still dallying with the relishes when a tray was brought in on
which was a basket containing a wooden hen with her wings rounded and
spread out as if she were brooding  Two slaves instantly approached and
to the accompaniment of music commenced to feel around in the straw
They pulled out some pea-hen's eggs which they distributed among the
diners  Turning his head Trimalchio saw what was going on  Friends
he remarked  I ordered pea-hen's eggs set under the hen but I'm afraid
they're addled by Hercules I am let's try them anyhow and see if
they're still fit to suck  We picked up our spoons each of which
weighed not less than half a pound and punctured the shells which were
made of flour and dough and as a matter of fact I very nearly threw
mine away for it seemed to me that a chick had formed already but upon
hearing an old experienced guest vow There must be something good
here I broke open the shell with my hand and discovered a fine fat
fig-pecker imbedded in a yolk seasoned with pepper




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FOURTH

Having finished his game Trimalchio was served with a helping of
everything and was announcing in a loud voice his willingness to join
anyone in a second cup of honied wine when to a flourish of music the
relishes were suddenly whisked away by a singing chorus but a small dish
happened to fall to the floor in the scurry and a slave picked it up
Seeing this Trimalchio ordered that the boy be punished by a box on the
ear and made him throw it down again a janitor followed with his broom
and swept the silver dish away among the litter  Next followed two
long-haired Ethiopians carrying small leather bottles such as are
commonly seen in the hands of those who sprinkle sand in the arena and
poured wine upon our hands for no one offered us water  When
complimented upon these elegant extras the host cried out Mars loves
a fair fight and so I ordered each one a separate table that way these
stinking slaves won't make us so hot with their crowding  Some glass
bottles carefully sealed with gypsum were brought in at that instant a
label bearing this inscription was fastened to the neck of each one

OPIMIAN FALERNIAN
ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD

While we were studying the labels Trimalchio clapped his hands and
cried Ah me  To think that wine lives longer than poor little man
Let's fillem up  There's life in wine and this is the real Opimian
you can take my word for that  I offered no such vintage yesterday
though my guests were far more respectable  We were tippling away and
extolling all these elegant devices when a slave brought in a silver
skeleton so contrived that the joints and movable vertebra could be
turned in any direction  He threw it down upon the table a time or two
and its mobile articulation caused it to assume grotesque attitudes
whereupon Trimalchio chimed in

Poor man is nothing in the scheme of things
And Orcus grips us and to Hades flings
Our bones  This skeleton before us here
Is as important as we ever were
Let's live then while we may and life is dear




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIFTH

The applause was followed by a course which by its oddity drew every
eye but it did not come up to our expectations  There was a circular
tray around which were displayed the signs of the zodiac and upon each
sign the caterer had placed the food best in keeping with it  Ram's
vetches on Aries a piece of beef on Taurus kidneys and lamb's fry on
Gemini a crown on Cancer the womb of an unfarrowed sow on Virgo an
African fig on Leo on Libra a balance one pan of which held a tart and
the other a cake a small seafish on Scorpio a bull's eye on
Sagittarius a sea lobster on Capricornus a goose on Aquarius and two
mullets on Pisces  In the middle lay a piece of cut sod upon which
rested a honeycomb with the grass arranged around it  An Egyptian slave
passed bread around from a silver oven and in a most discordant voice
twisted out a song in the manner of the mime in the musical farce called
Laserpitium  Seeing that we were rather depressed at the prospect of
busying ourselves with such vile fare Trimalchio urged us to fall to
Let us fall to gentlemen I beg of you this is only the sauce




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SIXTH

While he was speaking four dancers ran in to the time of the music
and removed the upper part of the tray  Beneath on what seemed to be
another tray we caught sight of stuffed capons and sowsbellies and in
the middle a hare equipped with wings to resemble Pegasus  At the
corners of the tray we also noted four figures of Marsyas and from their
bladders spouted a highly spiced sauce upon fish which were swimming
about as if in a tide-race  All of us echoed the applause which was
started by the servants and fell to upon these exquisite delicacies
with a laugh  Carver cried Trimalchio no less delighted with the
artifice practised upon us and the carver appeared immediately  Timing
his strokes to the beat of the music he cut up the meat in such a fashion
as to lead you to think that a gladiator was fighting from a chariot to
the accompaniment of a water-organ  Every now and then Trimalchio would
repeat Carver Carver in a low voice until I finally came to the
conclusion that some joke was meant in repeating a word so frequently so
I did not scruple to question him who reclined above me  As he had often
experienced byplay of this sort he explained You see that fellow who is
carving the meat don't you  Well his name is Carver  Whenever
Trimalchio says Carver carve her by the same word he both calls and
commands




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SEVENTH

I could eat no more so I turned to my whilom informant to learn as much
as I could and sought to draw him out with far-fetched gossip  I
inquired who that woman could be who was scurrying about hither and yon
in such a fashion  She's called Fortunata he replied  She's the
wife of Trimalchio and she measures her money by the peck  And only a
little while ago what was she  May your genius pardon me but you would
not have been willing to take a crust of bread from her hand  Now
without rhyme or reason she's in the seventh heaven and is Trimalchio's
factotum so much so that he would believe her if she told him it was
dark when it was broad daylight  As for him he don't know how rich he
is but this harlot keeps an eye on everything and where you least expect
to find her you're sure to run into her  She's temperate sober full
of good advice and has many good qualities but she has a scolding
tongue a very magpie on a sofa those she likes she likes but those
she dislikes she dislikes  Trimalchio himself has estates as broad as
the flight of a kite is long and piles of money  There's more silver
plate lying in his steward's office than other men have in their whole
fortunes  And as for slaves damn me if I believe a tenth of them knows
the master by sight  The truth is that these stand-a-gapes are so much
in awe of him that any one of them would step into a fresh dunghill
without ever knowing it at a mere nod from him




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-EIGHTH

And don't you get the idea that he buys anything everything is produced
at home wool pitch pepper if you asked for hen's milk you would get
it  Because he wanted his wool to rival other things in quality he
bought rams at Tarentum and sentem into his flocks with a slap on the
arse  He had bees brought from Attica so he could produce Attic honey
at home and as a side issue so he could improve the native bees by
crossing with the Greek  He even wrote to India for mushroom seed one
day and he hasn't a single mule that wasn't sired by a wild ass  Do you
see all those cushions  Not a single one but what is stuffed with either
purple or scarlet wool  He hasn't anything to worry about  Look out how
you criticise those other fellow-freedmen-friends of his they're all
well heeled  See the fellow reclining at the bottom of the end couch
He's worth his 800000 any day and he rose from nothing  Only a short
while ago he had to carry faggots on his own back  I don't know how true
it is but they say that he snatched off an Incubo's hat and found a
treasure  For my part I don't envy any man anything that was given him
by a god  He still carries the marks of his box on the ear and he isn't
wishing himself any bad luck  He posted this notice only the other day

CAIUS POMPONIUS DIOGENES HAS
PURCHASED A HOUSE
THIS GARNET FOR RENT AFTER
THE KALENDS OF JULY

What do you think of the fellow in the freedman's place  He has a good
front too hasn't he  And he has a right to  He saw his fortune
multiplied tenfold but he lost heavily through speculation at the last
I don't think he can call his very hair his own and it is no fault of
his either by Hercules it isn't  There's no better fellow anywhere his
rascally freedmen cheated him out of everything  You know very well how
it is everybody's business is nobody's business and once let business
affairs start to go wrong your friends will stand from under  Look at
the fix he's in and think what a fine trade he had  He used to be an
undertaker  He dined like a king boars roasted whole in their shaggy
Bides bakerspastries birds cooks and bakers  More wine was spilled
under his table than another has in his wine cellar  His life was like a
pipe dream not like an ordinary mortal's  When his affairs commenced to
go wrong and he was afraid his creditors would guess that he was
bankrupt he advertised an auction and this was his placard

JULIUS PROCULUS WILL SELL AT
AUCTION HIS SUPERFLUOUS
FURNITURE




CHAPTER THE THIRTY-NINTH

Trimalchio broke in upon this entertaining gossip for the course had
been removed and the guests happy with wine had started a general
conversation lying back upon his couch You ought to make this wine go
down pleasantly he said the fish must have something to swim in  But
I say you didn't think I'd be satisfied with any such dinner as you saw
on the top of that tray Is Ulysses no better known Well well we
shouldn't forget our culture even at dinner  May the bones of my patron
rest in peace he wanted me to become a man among men  No one can show
me anything new and that little tray has proved it  This heaven where
the gods live turns into as many different signs and sometimes into the
Ram therefore whoever is born under that sign will own many flocks and
much wool a hard head a shameless brow and a sharp horn  A great many
school-teachers and rambunctious butters-in are born under that sign
We applauded the wonderful penetration of our astrologer and he ran on
Then the whole heaven turns into a bull-calf and the kickers and
herdsmen and those who see to it that their own bellies are full come
into the world  Teams of horses and oxen are born under the Twins and
well-hung wenchers and those who bedung both sides of the wall  I was
born under the Crab and therefore stand on many legs and own much
property on land and sea for the crab is as much at home on one as he is
in the other  For that reason I put nothing on that sign for fear of
weighing down my own destiny  Bulldozers and gluttons are born under the
Lion and women and fugitives and chain-gangs are born under the Virgin
Butchers and perfumers are born under the Balance and all who think that
it is their business to straighten things out  Poisoners and assassins
are born under the Scorpion  Cross-eyed people who look at the
vegetables and sneak away with the bacon are born under the Archer
Horny-handed sons of toil are born under Capricorn  Bartenders and
pumpkin-heads are born under the Water-Carrier  Caterers and
rhetoricians are born under the Fishes and so the world turns round
just like a mill and something bad always comes to the top and men are
either being born or else they're dying  As to the sod and the honeycomb
in the middle for I never do anything without a reason Mother Earth is
in the centre round as an egg and all that is good is found in her
just like it is in a honeycomb




CHAPTER THE FORTIETH

Bravo  we yelled and with hands uplifted to the ceiling we swore
that such fellows as Hipparchus and Aratus were not to be compared with
him  At length some slaves came in who spread upon the couches some
coverlets upon which were embroidered nets and hunters stalking their
game with boar-spears and all the paraphernalia of the chase  We knew
not what to look for next until a hideous uproar commenced just outside
the dining-room door and some Spartan hounds commenced to run around the
table all of a sudden  A tray followed them upon which was served a
wild boar of immense size wearing a liberty cap upon its head and from
its tusks hung two little baskets of woven palm fibre one of which
contained Syrian dates the other Theban  Around it hung little
suckling pigs made from pastry signifying that this was a brood-sow with
her pigs at suck  It turned out that these were souvenirs intended to be
taken home  When it came to carving the boar our old friend Carver who
had carved the capons did not appear but in his place a great bearded
giant with bands around his legs and wearing a short hunting cape in
which a design was woven  Drawing his hunting-knife he plunged it
fiercely into the boar's side and some thrushes flew out of the gash
fowlers ready with their rods caught them in a moment as they
fluttered around the room and Trimalchio ordered one to each guest
remarking Notice what fine acorns this forest-bred boar fed on and as
he spoke some slaves removed the little baskets from the tusks and
divided the Syrian and Theban dates equally among the diners




CHAPTER THE FORTY-FIRST

Getting a moment to myself in the meantime I began to speculate as to
why the boar had come with a liberty cap upon his head  After exhausting
my invention with a thousand foolish guesses I made bold to put the
riddle which teased me to my old informant  Why sure he replied
even your slave could explain that there's no riddle everything's as
plain as day  This boar made his first bow as the last course of
yesterday's dinner and was dismissed by the guests so today he comes
back as a freedman  I damned my stupidity and refrained from asking any
more questions for fear I might leave the impression that I had never
dined among decent people before  While we were speaking a handsome
boy crowned with vine leaves and ivy passed grapes around in a little
basket and impersonated Bacchus-happy Bacchus-drunk and
Bacchus-dreaming reciting in the meantime his master's verses in a
shrill voice  Trimalchio turned to him and said Dionisus be thou
Liber whereupon the boy immediately snatched the cap from the boar's
head and put it upon his own  At that Trimalchio added You can't
deny that my father's middle name was Liber  We applauded Trimalchio's
conceit heartily and kissed the boy as he went around  Trimalchio
retired to the close-stool after this course and we having freedom of
action with the tyrant away began to draw the other guests out  After
calling for a bowl of wine Dama spoke up A day's nothing at all it's
night before you can turn around so you can't do better than to go
right to the dining-room from your bed  It's been so cold that I can
hardly get warm in a bath but a hot drink's as good as an overcoat
I've had some long pegs and between you and me I'm a bit groggy the
booze has gone to my head




CHAPTER THE FORTY-SECOND

Here Seleucus took up the tale  I don't bathe every day he confided
a bath uses you up like a fuller water's got teeth and your strength
wastes away a little every day but when I've downed a pot of mead I
tell the cold to suck my cock  I couldn't bathe today anyway because I
was at a funeral dandy fellow he was too good old Chrysanthus slipped
his wind  Why only the other day he said good morningto me and I
almost think I'm talking to him now  Gawd's truth we're only blown-up
bladders strutting around we're less than flies for they have some good
in them but we're only bubbles  And supposing he had not kept to such a
low diet  Why not a drop of water or a crumb of bread so much as passed
his lips for five days and yet he joined the majority  Too many doctors
did away with him or rather his time had come for a doctor's not good
for anything except for a consolation to your mind  He was well carried
out anyhow in the very bed he slept in during his lifetime  And he was
covered with a splendid pall the mourning was tastefully managed he had
freed some slaves even though his wife was sparing with her tears and
what if he hadn't treated her so well  But when you come to women women
all belong to the kite species no one ought to waste a good turn upon
one of them it's just like throwing it down a well  An old love's like
a cancer




CHAPTER THE FORTY-THIRD

He was becoming very tiresome and Phileros cried out Let's think about
the living  He has what was coming to him he lived respectably and
respectably he died  What's he got to kick about'  He made his pile
from an as and would pick a quadrans out of a dunghill with his teeth
any old time  And he grew richer and richer of course just like a
honeycomb  I expect that he left all of a hundred thousand by Hercules
I do  All in cold cash too but I've eaten dog's tongue and must speak
the truth he was foul-mouthed had a ready tongue he was a trouble
maker and no man  Now his brother was a good fellow a friend to his
friend free-handed and he kept a liberal table  He picked a loser at
the start but his first vintage set him upon his legs for he sold his
wine at the figure he demanded and what made him hold his head higher
still he came into a legacy from which he stole more than had been left
to him  Then that fool friend of yours in a fit of anger at his
brother willed his property away to some son-of-a-bitch or other who
he was I don't know but when a man runs away from his own kin he has
a long way to go  And what's more he had some slaves who were
ear-specialists at the keyhole and they did him a lot of harm for a man
won't prosper when he believes on the spot every tale that he hears a
man in business especially  Still he had a good time as long as he
lived for happy's the fellow who gets the gift not the one it was meant
for  He sure was Fortune's son  Lead turned to gold in his hands  It's
easy enough when everything squares up and runs on schedule  How old
would you think he was  Seventy and over but he was as tough as horn
carried his age well and was as black as a crow  I knew the fellow for
years and years and he was a lecher to the very last  I don't believe
that even the dog in his house escaped his attentions by Hercules I
don't and what a boy-lover he was  Saw a virgin in every one he met
Not that I blame him though for it's all he could take with him




CHAPTER THE FORTY-FOURTH

Phileros had his say and Ganymedes exclaimed You gabble away about
things that don't concern heaven or earth and none of you cares how the
price of grain pinches  I couldn't even get a mouthful of bread today
by Hercules I couldn't  How the drought does hang on  We've had famine
for a year  If the damned AEdiles would only get what's coming to them
They graft with the bakers scratch-my-arse-and-I'll-scratch-yours
That's the way it always is the poor devils are out of luck but the
jaws of the capitalists are always keeping the Saturnalia  If only we
had such lion-hearted sports as we had when I first came from Asia  That
was the life  If the flour was not the very best they would beat up
those belly-robbing grafters till they looked like Jupiter had been at
them  How well I remember Safinius he lived near the old arch when I
was a boy  For a man he was one hot proposition  Wherever he went the
ground smoked  But he was square dependable a friend to a friend you
could safely play mora with him in the dark  But how he did peel them
in the town hall he spoke no parables not he  He did everything
straight from the shoulder and his voice roared like a trumpet in the
forum  He never sweat nor spat  I don't know but I think he had a
strain of the Asiatic in him  And how civil and friendly-like he was
in returning everyone's greeting called us all by name just like he was
one of us  And so provisions were cheap as dirt in those days  The loaf
you got for an as you couldn't eat not even if someone helped you but
you see them no bigger than a bull's eye now and the hell of it is that
things are getting worse every day this colony grows backwards like a
calf's tall  Why do we have to put up with an AEdile here who's not
worth three Caunian figs and who thinks more of an as than of our lives
He has a good time at home and his daily income's more than another
man's fortune  I happen to know where he got a thousand gold pieces
If we had any nuts he'd not be so damned well pleased with himself
Nowadays men are lions at home and foxes abroad  What gets me is that
I've already eaten my old clothes and if this high cost of living keeps
on I'll have to sell my cottages  What's going to happen to this town
if neither gods nor men take pity on it  May I never have any luck if I
don't believe all this comes from the gods  For no one believes that
heaven is heaven no one keeps a fast no one cares a hang about Jupiter
they all shut their eyes and count up their own profits  In the old
days the married women in their stolas climbed the hill in their bare
feet pure in heart and with their hair unbound and prayed to Jupiter
for rain  And it would pour down in bucketfuls then or never and they'd
all come home wet as drowned rats  But the gods all have the gout now
because we are not religious and so our fields are burning up




CHAPTER THE FORTY-FIFTH

Don't be so down in the mouth chimed in Echion the ragman if it
wasn't that it'd be something else as the farmer said when he lost his
spotted pig  If a thing don't happen today it may tomorrow  That's the
way life jogs along  You couldn't name a better country by Hercules
you couldn't if only the men had any brains  She's in hot water right
now but she ain't the only one  We oughtn't to be so particular
heaven's as far away everywhere else  If you were somewhere else you'd
swear that pigs walked around here already roasted  Think of what's
coming  We'll soon have a fine gladiator show to last for three days no
training-school pupils most of them will be freedmen  Our Titus has a
hot head and plenty of guts and it will go to a finish  I'm well
acquainted with him and he'll not stand for any frame-ups  It will be
cold steel in the best style no running away the shambles will be in
the middle of the amphitheatre where all the crowd can see  And what's
more he has the coin for he came into thirty million when his father
had the bad luck to die  He could blow in four hundred thousand and his
fortune never feel it but his name would live forever  He has some
dwarfs already and a woman to fight from a chariot  Then there's
Glyco's steward he was caught screwing Glyco's wife  You'll see some
battle between jealous husbands and favored lovers  Anyhow that cheap
screw of a Glyco condemned his steward to the beasts and only published
his own shame  How could the slave go wrong when he only obeyed orders
It would have been better if that she-piss-pot for that's all she's fit
for had been tossed by the bull but a fellow has to beat the saddle
when he can't beat the jackass  How could Glyco ever imagine that a
sprig of Hermogenesplanting could turn out well  Why Hermogenes could
trim the claws of a flying hawk and no snake ever hatched out a rope
yet  And look at Glyco  He's smoked himself out in fine shape and as
long as he lives he'll carry that stain  No one but the devil himself
can wipe that out but chickens always come home to roost  My nose tells
me that Mammaea will set out a spread two bits apiece for me and mine
And he'll nick Norbanus out of his political pull if he does you all
know that it's to his interest to hump himself to get the best of him
And honestly what did that fellow ever do for us  He exhibited some two
cent gladiators that were so near dead they'd have fallen flat if you
blew your breath at them  I've seen better thugs sent against wild
beasts  And the cavalry he killed looked about as much like the real
thing as the horsemen on the lamps you would have taken them for
dunghill cocks  One plug had about as much action as a jackass with a
pack-saddle another was club-footed and a third who had to take the
place of one that was killed was as good as dead and hamstrung into the
bargain  There was only one that had any pep and he was a Thracian but
he only fought when we egged him on  The whole crowd was flogged
afterwards  How the mob did yellLay it on They were nothing but
runaways  And at that he had the nerve to sayI've given you a show'
'And I've applaudedI answeredcount it up and you'll find that I
gave more than I got  One hand washes the other'




CHAPTER THE FORTY-SIXTH

Agamemnon your looks seem to say What's this boresome nut trying to
hand us Well I'm talking because you who can talk book-foolishness
won't  You don't belong to our bunch so you laugh in your sleeve at the
way us poor people talk but we know that you're only a fool with a lot
of learning  Well what of it  Some day I'll get you to come to my
country place and take a look at my little estate  We'll have fresh eggs
and spring chicken to chew on when we get there it will be all right
even if the weather has kept things back this year  We'll find enough to
satisfy us and my kid will soon grow up to be a pupil of yours he can
divide up to four now and you'll have a little servant at your side if
he lives  When he has a minute to himself he never takes his eyes from
his tablets he's smart too and has the right kind of stuff in him even
if he is crazy about birds  I've had to kill three of his linnets
already  I told him that a weasel had gotten them but he's found
another hobby now he paints all the time  He's left the marks of his
heels on his Greek already and is doing pretty well with his Latin
although his master's too easy with him won't make him stick to one
thing  He comes to me to get me to give him something to write when his
master don't want to work  Then there's another tutor too no scholar
but very painstaking though he can teach you more than he knows
himself  He comes to the house on holidays and is always satisfied with
whatever you pay him  Some little time ago I bought the kid some law
books I want him to have a smattering of the law for home use  There's
bread in that  As for literature he's got enough of that in him
already if he begins to kick I've concluded that I'll make him learn
some trade the barber's say or the auctioneer's or even the lawyer's
That's one thing no one but the devil can do him out of Believe  what
your  daddy  says PrimigeniusI din into his ears every daywhenever
you learn a thing it's yours  Look at Phileros the attorney he'd not
be keeping the wolf from the door now if he hadn't studied  It's not
long since he had to carry his wares on his back and peddle them but he
can put up a front with Norbanus himself now  Learning's a fine thing
and a trade won't starve'




CHAPTER THE FORTY-SEVENTH

Twaddle of this sort was being bandied about when Trimalchio came in
mopping his forehead and washing his hands in perfume he said after a
short pause Pardon me gentlemen but my stomach's been on strike for
the past few days and the doctors disagreed about the cause  But
pomegranate rind and pitch steeped in vinegar have helped me and I hope
that my belly will get on its good behavior for sometimes there's such a
rumbling in my guts that you'd think a bellowing bull was in there  So
if anyone wants to do his business there's no call to be bashful about
it  None of us was born solid  I don't know of any worse torment than
having to hold it in it's the one thing Jupiter himself can't hold in
So you're laughing are you Fortunata  Why you're always keeping me
awake at night yourself  I never objected yet to anyone in my
dining-room relieving himself when he wanted to and the doctors forbid
our holding it in  Everything's ready outside if the call's more
serious water close-stool and anything else you'll need Believe me
when this rising vapor gets to the brain it puts the whole body on the
burn  Many a one I've known to kick in just because he wouldn't own up
to the truth  We thanked him for his kindness and consideration and
hid our laughter by drinking more and oftener We had not realized that
as yet we were only in the middle of the entertainment with a hill
still ahead as the saying goes  The tables were cleared off to the beat
of music and three white hogs muzzled and wearing bells were brought
into the dining-room  The announcer informed us that one was a
two-year-old another three and the third just turned six  I had an
idea that some rope-dancers had come in and that the hogs would perform
tricks just as they do for the crowd on the streets but Trimalchio
dispelled this illusion by asking Which one will you have served up
immediately for dinner  Any country cook can manage a dunghill cock a
pentheus hash or little things like that but my cooks are well used to
serving up calves boiled whole in their cauldrons Then he ordered a
cook to be called in at once and without awaiting our pleasure he
directed that the oldest be butchered and demanded in a loud voice
What division do you belong too  When the fellow made answer that he
was from the fortieth Were you bought or born upon my estates
Trimalchio continued  Neither replied the cook I was left to you by
Pansa's will  See to it that this is properly done Trimalchio
warned or I'll have you transferred to the division of messengers
and the cook bearing his master's warning in mind departed for the
kitchen with the next course in tow




CHAPTER THE FORTY-EIGHTH

Trimalchio's threatening face relaxed and he turned to us If the wine
don't please you he said I'll change it you ought to do justice to
it by drinking it  I don't have to buy it thanks to the gods
Everything here that makes your mouths water was produced on one of my
country places which I've never yet seen but they tell me it's down
Terracina and Tarentum way  I've got a notion to add Sicily to my other
little holdings so in case I want to go to Africa I'll be able to sail
along my own coasts  But tell me the subject of your speech today
Agamemnon for though I don't plead cases myself I studied literature
for home use and for fear you should think I don't care about learning
let me inform you that I have three libraries one Greek and the others
Latin  Give me the outline of your speech if you like me

A poor man and a rich man were enemies Agamemmon began when What's
a poor man  Trimalchio broke in  Well put Agamemnon conceded and
went into details upon some problem or other what it was I do not know
Trimalchio instantly rendered the following verdict If that's the case
there's nothing to dispute about if it's not the case it don't amount
to anything anyhow  These flashes of wit and others equally
scintillating we loudly applauded and he went on Tell me my dearest
Agamemnon do you remember the twelve labors of Hercules or the story of
Ulysses how the Cyclops threw his thumb out of joint with a pig-headed
crowbar  When I was a boy I used to read those stories in Homer  And
then there's the Sibyl with my own eyes I saw her at Cumae hanging up
in a jar and whenever the boys would say to herSibyl Sibyl what
would youshe would answerI would die'




CHAPTER THE FORTY-NINTH

Before he had run out of wind a tray upon which was an enormous hog was
placed upon the table almost filling it up  We began to wonder at the
dispatch with which it had been prepared and swore that no cock could
have been served up in so short a time moreover this hog seemed to us
far bigger than the boar had been Trimalchio scrutinized it closely and
What the hell he suddenly bawled out this hog hain't been gutted
has it  No it hain't by Hercules it hain't  Call that cook  Call
that cook in here immediately  When the crestfallen cook stood at the
table and owned up that he had forgotten to bowel him So you forgot
did you  Trimalchio shouted You'd think he'd only left out a bit of
pepper and cummin wouldn't you Off with his clothes  The cook was
stripped without delay and stood with hanging head between two
torturers  We all began to make excuses for him at this saying Little
things like that are bound to happen once in a while let us prevail upon
you to let him off if he ever does such a thing again not a one of us
will have a word to say in his behalf  But for my part I was
mercilessly angry and could not help leaning over towards Agamemnon and
whispering in his ear It is easily seen that this fellow is criminally
careless is it not  How could anyone forget to draw a hog  If he had
served me a fish in that fashion I wouldn't overlook it by Hercules I
wouldn't  But that was not Trimalchio's way his face relaxed into good
humor and he said Since your memory's so short you can gut him right
here before our eyes The cook put on his tunic snatched up a carving
knife with a trembling hand and slashed the hog's belly in several
places  Sausages and meat-puddings widening the apertures by their
own weight immediately tumbled out




CHAPTER THE FIFTIETH

The whole household burst into unanimous applause at this Hurrah for
Gaius they shouted  As for the cook he was given a drink and a silver
crown and a cup on a salver of Corinthian bronze Seeing that Agamemnon
was eyeing the platter closely Trimalchio remarked I'm the only one
that can show the real Corinthian I thought that in his usual
purse-proud manner he was going to boast that his bronzes were all
imported from Corinth but he did even better by saying Wouldn't you
like to know how it is that I'm the only one that can show the real
Corinthian  Well it's because the bronze worker I patronize is named
Corinthus and what's Corinthian unless it's what a Corinthus makes
And so you won't think I'm a blockhead I'm going to show you that I'm
well acquainted with how Corinthian first came into the world  When Troy
was taken Hannibal who was a very foxy fellow and a great rascal into
the bargain piled all the gold and silver and bronze statues in one pile
and setem afire melting these different metals into one then the
metal workers took their pick and made bowls and dessert dishes and
statuettes as well  That's how Corinthian was born neither one nor the
other but an amalgam of all  But I prefer glass if you don't mind my
saying so it don't stink and if it didn't break I'd rather have it
than gold but it's cheap and common now




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FIRST

But there was an artisan once upon a time who made a glass vial that
couldn't be broken  On that account he was admitted to Caesar with his
gift then he dashed it upon the floor when Caesar handed it back to
him  The Emperor was greatly startled but the artisan picked the vial
up off the pavement and it was dented just like a brass bowl would have
been  He took a little hammer out of his tunic and beat out the dent
without any trouble  When he had done that he thought he would soon be
in Jupiter's heaven and more especially when Caesar said to himIs
there anyone else who knows how to make this malleable glass  Think
now And when he denied that anyone else knew the secret Caesar
ordered his head chopped off because if this should get out we would
think no more of gold than we would of dirt




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SECOND

And when it comes to silver I'm a connoisseur I have goblets as big as
wine-jars a hundred ofem more or less with engraving that shows how
Cassandra killed her sons and the dead boys are lying so naturally that
you'd thinkem alive  I own a thousand bowls which Mummius left to my
patron where Daedalus is shown shutting Niobe up in the Trojan horse
and I also have cups engraved with the gladiatorial contests of Hermeros
and Petraites they're all heavy too  I wouldn't sell my taste in these
matters for any money  A slave dropped a cup while he was running on in
this fashion  Glaring at him Trimalchio said Go hang yourself since
you're so careless  The boy's lip quivered and he immediately commenced
to beg for mercy  Why do you pray to me  Trimalchio demanded at
this I don't intend to be harsh with you I'm only warning you against
being so awkward  Finally however we got him to give the boy a pardon
and no sooner had this been done than the slave started running around
the room crying Out with the water and in with the wine  We all paid
tribute to this joke but Agamemnon in particular for he well knew what
strings to pull in order to secure another invitation to dinner  Tickled
by our flattery and mellowed by the wine Trimalchio was just about
drunk  Why hasn't one of you asked my Fortunata to dance  he
demanded There's no one can do a better cancan believe me and he
himself raised his arms above his head and favored us with an
impersonation of Syrus the actor the whole household chanting

Oh bravo
Oh bravissimo

in chorus and he would have danced out into the middle of the room
before us all had not Fortunata whispered in his ear telling him
I suppose that such low buffoonery was not in keeping with his dignity
But nothing could be so changeable as his humor for one minute he stood
in awe of Fortunata but his natural propensities would break out the
next




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-THIRD

But his passion for dancing was interrupted at this stage by a
stenographer who read aloud as if he were reading the public records
On the seventh of the Kalends of July on Trimalchio's estates near
Cumae were born thirty boys and forty girls five hundred pecks of wheat
were taken from the threshing floors and stored in the granaries five
hundred oxen were put to yoke the slave Mithridates was crucified on the
same date for cursing the genius of our master Gaius on said date ten
million sesterces were returned to the vaults as no sound investment
could be found on said date a fire broke out in the gardens at Pompeii
said fire originating in the house of Nasta the bailiff  What's
that demanded Trimalchio  When were the gardens at Pompeii bought for
me  Why last year answered the stenographer for that reason the
item has not appeared in the accounts  Trimalchio flew into a rage at
this  If I'm not told within six months of any real estate that's
bought for me he shouted I forbid it's being carried to my account at
all  Next the edicts of his aediles were read aloud and the wills of
some of his foresters in which Trimalchio was disinherited by a codicil
then the names of his bailiffs and that of a freedwoman who had been
repudiated by a night watchman after she had been caught in bed with a
bath attendant that of a porter banished to Baioe a steward who was
standing trial and lastly the report of a decision rendered in the
matter of a lawsuit between some valets  When this was over with some
rope dancers came in and a very boresome fool stood holding a ladder
ordering his boy to dance from rung to rung and finally at the top all
this to the music of popular airs then the boy was compelled to jump
through blazing hoops while grasping a huge wine jar with his teeth
Trimalchio was the only one who was much impressed by these tricks
remarking that it was a thankless calling and adding that in all the
world there were just two things which could give him acute pleasure
rope-dancers and horn blowers all other entertainments were nothing
but nonsense  I bought a company of comedians he went on but I
preferred for them to put on Atellane farces and I ordered my
flute-player to play Latin airs only




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FOURTH

While our noble Gaius was still talking away the boy slipped and fell
alighting upon Trimalchio's arm  The whole household cried out as did
also the guests not that they bore such a coarse fellow any good will
as they would gladly have seen his neck broken but because such an
unlucky ending to the dinner might make it necessary for them to go into
mourning over a total stranger  As for Trimalchio he groaned heavily
and bent over his arm as though it had been injured doctors flocked
around him and Fortunata was among the very first her hair was
streaming and she held a cup in her hand and screamed out her grief and
unhappiness  As for the boy who had fallen he was crawling at our feet
imploring pardon  I was uneasy for fear his prayers would lead up to
some ridiculous theatrical climax for I had not yet been able to forget
that cook who had forgotten to bowel that hog and so for this reason I
began to scan the whole dining-room very closely to see if an automaton
would come out through the wall and all the more so as a slave was
beaten for having bound up his master's bruised arm in white wool instead
of purple  Nor was my suspicion unjustified for in place of punishment
Trimalchio ordered that the boy be freed so that no one could say that
so exalted a personage had been injured by a slave




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-FIFTH

We applauded his action and engaged in a discussion upon the instability
of human affairs which many took sides A good reason declared
Trimalchio why such an occasion shouldn't slip by without an epigram
He called for his tablets at once and after racking his brains for a
little while he got off the following

The unexpected will turn up
Our whole lives Fortune bungles up
Falernian boy hand round the cup

This epigram led up to a discussion of the poets and for a long time
the greatest praise was bestowed upon Mopsus the Thracian until
Trimalchio broke in with Professor I wish you'd tell me how you'd
compare Cicero and Publilius  I'm of the opinion that the first was the
more eloquent but that the last moralizes more beautifully for what can
excel these lines

Insatiable luxury crumbles the walls of war
To satiate gluttony peacocks in coops are brought
Arrayed in gold plumage like Babylon tapestry rich
Numidian guinea-fowls capons all perish for thee
And even the wandering stork welcome guest that he is
The emblem of sacred maternity slender of leg
And gloctoring exile from winter herald of spring
Still finds his last nest in the cauldron of gluttony base
India surrenders her pearls and what mean they to thee
That thy wife decked with sea-spoils adorning her breast
and her head
On the couch of a stranger lies lifting adulterous legs
The emerald green the glass bauble what mean they to thee
Or the fire of the ruby  Except that pure chastity shine
From the depth of the jewels in garments of woven wind clad
Our brides might as well take their stand their game
naked to stalk
As seek it in gossamer tissue transparent as air




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SIXTH

What should we say was the hardest calling after literature he asked
That of the doctor or that of the money-changer I would say the
doctor because he has to know what poor devils have got in their
insides and when the fever's due but I hate them like the devil for my
part because they're always ordering me on a diet of duck soup and the
money-changer's because he's got to be able to see the silver through
the copper plating  When we come to the dumb beasts the oxen and sheep
are the hardest worked the oxen thanks to whose labor we have bread to
chew on the sheep because their wool tricks us out so fine  It's the
greatest outrage under the sun for people to eat mutton and then wear a
tunic  Then there's the bee in my opinion they're divine insects
because they puke honey though there are folks that claim that they
bring it from Jupiter and that's the reason they sting too for
wherever you find a sweet you'll find a bitter too He was just putting
the philosophers out of business when lottery tickets were passed around
in a cup  A slave boy assigned to that duty read aloud the names of the
souvenirs Silver s ham a ham was brought in with some silver vinegar
cruets on top of it cervical something soft for the neck a piece of
the cervix neck of a sheep was brought in serisapia after wit and
contumelia insult we were given must wafers and an apple-melon and a
phallus contus  porri leeks and persica he picked up a whip and
a knife passeres sparrows and a fly trap the answer was
raisins uva passa and Attic honey cenatoria a dinner toga and
forensia business dress he handed out a piece of meat suggestive of
dinner and a note-book suggestive of business  canale chased by a
dog and pedale pertaining to the foot  a hare and a slipper were
brought out lamphrey murena and a letter he held up a
mouse mus and a frog rana tied together and a bundle of
beet beta the Greek letter beta   We laughed long and loud there
were a thousand of these jokes more or less which have now escaped my
memory




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-SEVENTH

But Ascyltos threw off all restraint and ridiculed everything throwing
up his hands he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks  At last
one of Trimalchio's fellow-freedmen the one who had the place next to
me flew into a rage What's the joke sheep's-head he bawled Don't
our host's swell entertainment suit you  You're richer than he is I
suppose and used to dining better  As I hope the guardian spirit of
this house will be on my side I'd have stopped his bleating long ago if
I'd been sitting next to him  He's a peach he is laughing at others
some vagabond or other from who-knows-where some night-pad who's not
worth his own piss just let me piss a ring around him and he wouldn't
know where to run to  I ain't easy riled no by Hercules I ain't but
worms breed in tender flesh  Look at him laugh  What the hell's he got
to laugh at  Is his family so damned fine-haired  So you're a Roman
knight  Well I'm a king's son  How's it come that you've been a slave
you'll ask because I put myself into service because I'd rather be a
Roman citizen than a tax-paying provincial  And now I hope that my life
will be such that no one can jeer at me  I'm a man among men  I take my
stroll bareheaded and owe no man a copper cent  I never had a summons in
my life and no one ever said to me in the forum pay me what you owe me
I've bought a few acres and saved up a few dollars and I feed twenty
bellies and a dog  I ransomed my bedfellow so no one could wipe his
hands on her bosom a thousand dinars it cost me too  I was chosen
priest of Augustus without paying the fee and I hope that I won't need
to blush in my grave after I'm dead  But you're so busy that you can't
look behind you you can spot a louse on someone else all right but you
can't see the tick on yourself  You're the only one that thinks we're so
funny look at your professor he's older than you are and we're good
enough for him but you're only a brat with the milk still in your nose
and all you can prattle ismaormuyou're only a clay pot a piece
of leather soaked in water softer and slipperier but none the better
for that  You've got more coin than we have have you  Then eat two
breakfasts and two dinners a day  I'd rather have my reputation than
riches for my part and before I make an end of this who ever dunned me
twice  In all the forty years I was in service no one could tell
whether I was free or a slave  I was only a long-haired boy when I came
to this colony and the town house was not built then  I did my best to
please my master and he was a digniferous and majestical gentleman whose
nail-parings were worth more than your whole carcass  I had enemies in
his house too who would have been glad to trip me up but I swam the
flood thanks to his kindness  Those are the things that try your
mettle for it's as easy to be born a gentleman as to sayCome here'
Well what are you gaping at now like a billy-goat in a vetch-field




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-EIGHTH

Giton who had been standing at my feet and who had for some time been
holding in his laughter burst into an uproarious guffaw at this last
figure of speech and when Ascyltosadversary heard it he turned his
abuse upon the boy  What's so funny you curly-headed onion he
bellowed are the Saturnalia here I'd like to know  Is it December
now

When did you pay your twentieth  What's this to you you gallows-bird
you crow's meat  I'll call the anger of Jupiter down on you and that
master of yours who don't keep you in better order  If I didn't respect
my fellow-freedmen I'd give you what is coming to you right here on the
spot as I hope to get my belly full of bread I would  We'll get along
well enough but those that can't control you are fools like master like
man's a true saying  I can hardly hold myself in and I'm not hot-headed
by nature but once let me get a start and I don't care two cents for my
own mother  All right I'll catch you in the street you rat you
toadstool  May I never grow an inch up or down if I don't push your
master into a dunghill and I'll give you the same medicine I will by
Hercules I will no matter if you call down Olympian Jupiter himself
I'll take care of your eight inch ringlets and your two cent master into
the bargain  I'll have my teeth into you either you'll cut out the
laughing or I don't know myself  Yes even if you had a golden beard
I'll bring the wrath of Minerva down on you and on the fellow that first
made a come-here out of you  No I never learned geometry or criticism
or other foolishness like that but I know my capital letters and I can
divide any figure by a hundred be it in asses pounds or sesterces
Let's have a show-down you and I will make a little bet here's my coin
you'll soon find out that your father's money was wasted on your
education even if you do know a little rhetoric  How's this what part
of us am I  I come far I come wide now guess me  I'll give you
another  What part of us runs but never moves from its place  What part
of us grows but always grows less  But you scurry around and are as
flustered and fidgeted as a mouse in a piss-pot  Shut up and don't annoy
your betters who don't even know that you've been born  Don't think
that I'm impressed by those boxwood armlets that you did your mistress
out of  Occupo will back me  Let's go into the forum and borrow money
then you'll see whether this iron ring means credit  Bah  A draggled
fox is a fine sight ain't it'  I hope I never get rich and die decently
so that the people will swear by my death if I don't hound you
everywhere with my toga turned inside out  And the fellow that taught
you such manners did a good job too a chattering ape all right no
schoolmaster  We were better taught Is everything in its placethe
master would ask go straight home and don't stop and stare at everything
and don't be impudent to your elders  Don't loiter along looking in at
the shops  No second raters came out of that school  I'm what you see
me and I thank the gods it's all due to my own cleverness




CHAPTER THE FIFTY-NINTH

Ascyltos was just starting in to answer this indictment when Trimalchio
who was delighted with his fellow-freedman's tirade broke in Cut out
the bickering and let's have things pleasant here  Let up on the young
fellow Hermeros he's hot-blooded so you ought to be more reasonable
The loser's always the winner in arguments of this kind  And as for you
even when you were a young punk you used to goCo-co co-colike a hen
after a rooster but you had no pep Let's get to better business and
start the fun all over again and watch the Homerists  A troupe filed
in immediately and clashed spears against shields  Trimalchio sat
himself up on his cushion and intoned in Latin from a book while the
actors in accordance with their conceited custom recited their parts in
the Greek language  There came a pause presently and You don't any of
you know the plot of the skit they're putting on do you  he asked
Diomedes and Ganymede were two brothers and Helen was their sister
Agamemnon ran away with her and palmed off a doe on Diana in her place
so Homer tells how the Trojans and Parentines fought among themselves
Of course Agamemnon was victorious and gave his daughter Iphigenia to
Achilles for a wife This caused Ajax to go mad and he'll soon make the
whole thing plain to you  The Homerists raised a shout as soon as
Trimalchio had done speaking and as the whole familia stepped back a
boiled calf with a helmet on its head was brought in on an enormous
platter  Ajax followed and rushed upon it with drawn sword as if he
were insane he made passes with the flat and again with the edge and
then collecting the slices he skewered them and much to our
astonishment presented them to us on the point of his sword




CHAPTER THE SIXTIETH

But we were not given long in which to admire the elegance of such
service for all of a sudden the ceiling commenced to creak and then the
whole dining-room shook  I leaped to my feet in consternation for fear
some rope-walker would fall down and the rest of the company raised
their faces wondering as much as I what new prodigy was to be announced
from on high  Then lo and behold the ceiling panels parted and an
enormous hoop which appeared to have been knocked off a huge cask was
lowered from the dome above its perimeter was hung with golden chaplets
and jars of alabaster filled with perfume  We were asked to accept these
articles as souvenirs  When my glance returned to the table I noticed
that a dish containing cakes had been placed upon it and in the middle
an image of Priapus made by the baker and he held apples of all
varieties and bunches of grapes against his breast in the conventional
manner  We applied ourselves wholeheartedly to this dessert and our
joviality was suddenly revived by a fresh diversion for at the
slightest pressure all the cakes and fruits would squirt a saffron sauce
upon us and even spurted unpleasantly into our faces  Being convinced
that these perfumed dainties had some religious significance we arose in
a body and shouted Hurrah for the Emperor the father of his country
However as we perceived that even after this act of veneration the
others continued helping themselves we filled our napkins with the
apples  I was especially keen on this for I thought I could never put
enough good things into Giton's lap  Three slaves entered in the
meantime dressed in white tunics well tucked up and two of them placed
Lares with amulets hanging from their necks upon the table while the
third carried round a bowl of wine and cried May the gods be
propitious  One was called Cerdo business  Trimalchio informed us
the other Lucrio luck and the third Felicio profit and when all the
rest had kissed a true likeness of Trimalchio we were ashamed to pass it
by




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FIRST

After they had all wished each other sound minds and good health
Trimalchio turned to Niceros  You used to be better company at
dinner he remarked and I don't know why you should be dumb today
with never a word to say  If you wish to make me happy tell about that
experience you had I beg of you  Delighted at the affability of his
friend I hope I lose all my luck if I'm not tickled to death at the
humor I see you in Niceros replied  All right let's go the limit for
a good time though I'm afraid these scholars'll laugh at me but I'll
tell my tale and they can go as far as they like  What t'hell do I care
who laughs  It's better to be laughed at than laughed down  These
words spake the hero and began the following tale We lived in a narrow
street in the house Gavilla now owns when I was a slave  There by the
will of the gods I fell in love with the wife of Terentius the
innkeeper you knew Melissa of Tarentum that pretty round-checked little
wench  It was no carnal passion so hear me Hercules it wasn't I was
not in love with her physical charms  No it was because she was such a
good sport  I never asked her for a thing and had her deny me if she
had an as I had half  I trusted her with everything I had and never was
done out of anything  Her husband up and died on the place one day so
I tried every way I could to get to her for you know friends ought to
show up when anyone's in a pinch




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SECOND

It so happened that our master had gone to Capua to attend to some odds
and ends of business and I seized the opportunity and persuaded a guest
of the house to accompany me as far as the fifth mile-stone  He was a
soldier and as brave as the very devil  We set out about cock-crow the
moon was shining as bright as midday and came to where the tombstones
are  My man stepped aside amongst them but I sat down singing and
commenced to count them up  When I looked around for my companion he
had stripped himself and piled his clothes by the side of the road  My
heart was in my mouth and I sat there while he pissed a ring around them
and was suddenly turned into a wolf  Now don't think I'm joking I
wouldn't lie for any amount of money but as I was saying he commenced
to howl after he was turned into a wolf and ran away into the forest
I didn't know where I was for a minute or two then I went to his
clothes to pick them up and damned if they hadn't turned to stone  Was
ever anyone nearer dead from fright than me  Then I whipped out my sword
and cut every shadow along the road to bits till I came to the house of
my mistress  I looked like a ghost when I went in and I nearly slipped
my wind  The sweat was pouring down my crotch my eyes were staring and
I could hardly be brought around  My Melissa wondered why I was out so
late  Oh if you'd only come sooner she said you could have helped
us a wolf broke into the folds and attacked the sheep bleeding them
like a butcher  But he didn't get the laugh on me even if he did get
away for one of the slaves ran his neck through with a spear  I
couldn't keep my eyes shut any longer when I heard that and as soon as
it grew light I rushed back to our Gaiushouse like an innkeeper beaten
out of his bill and when I came to the place where the clothes had been
turned into stone there was nothing but a pool of blood  And moreover
when I got home my soldier was lying in bed like an ox and a doctor
was dressing his neck  I knew then that he was a werewolf and after
that I couldn't have eaten a crumb of bread with him no not if you had
killed me  Others can think what they please about this but as for me
I hope your geniuses will all get after me if I lie




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-THIRD

We were all dumb with astonishment when I take your story for granted
said Trimalchio and if you'll believe me my hair stood on end and
all the more because I know that Niceros never talks nonsense he's
always level-headed not a bit gossipy  And now I'll tell you a
hair-raiser myself though I'm like a jackass on a slippery pavement
compared to him  When I was a long-haired boy for I lived a Chian life
from my youth up my master's minion died  He was a jewel so hear me
Hercules he was perfect in every facet  While his sorrow-stricken
mother was bewailing his loss and the rest of us were lamenting with
her the witches suddenly commenced to screech so loud that you would
have thought a hare was being run down by the hounds  At that time we
had a Cappadocian slave tall very bold and he had muscle too he
could hold a mad bull in the air  He wrapped a mantle around his left
arm boldly rushed out of doors with drawn sword and ran a woman
through the middle about here no harm to what I touch  We heard a
scream but as a matter of fact for I won't lie to you we didn't catch
sight of the witches themselves  Our simpleton came back presently and
threw himself upon the bed  His whole body was black and blue as if he
had been flogged with whips and of course the reason of that was she
had touched him with her evil hand  We shut the door and returned to
our business but when the mother put her arms around the body of her
son it turned out that it was only a straw bolster no heart no guts
nothing  Of course the witches had swooped down upon the lad and put
the straw changeling in his place  Believe me or not suit yourselves
but I say that there are women that know too much and night-hags too
and they turn everything upside down  And as for the long-haired booby
he never got back his own natural color and he died raving mad a few
days later




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FOURTH

Though we wondered greatly we believed none the less implicitly and
kissing the table we besought the night-hags to attend to their own
affairs while we were returning home from dinner  As far as I was
concerned the lamps already seemed to burn double and the whole
dining-room was going round when See here Plocamus Trimalchio spoke
up haven't you anything to tell us  You haven't entertained us at all
have you  And you used to be fine company always ready to oblige with a
recitation or a song  The gods bless us how the green figs have
fallen  True for you the fellow answered since I've got the gout
my sporting days are over but in the good old times when I was a young
spark I nearly sang myself into a consumption  How I used to dance
And take my part in a farce or hold up my end in the barber shops  Who
could hold a candle to me except of course the one and only Apelles
He then put his hand to his mouth and hissed out some foul gibberish or
other and said afterwards that it was Greek  Trimalchio himself then
favored us with an impersonation of a man blowing a trumpet and when he
had finished he looked around for his minion whom he called Croesus a
blear-eyed slave whose teeth were very disagreeably discolored  He was
playing with a little black bitch disgustingly fat wrapping her up in a
leek-green scarf and teasing her with a half-loaf of bread which he had
put on the couch and when from sheer nausea she refused it he crammed
it down her throat  This sight put Trimalchio in mind of his own dog and
he ordered Scylax the guardian of his house and home to be brought
in  An enormous dog was immediately led in upon a chain and obeying a
kick from the porter it lay down beside the table Thereupon Trimalchio
remarked as he threw it a piece of white bread No one in all my house
loves me better than Scylax  Enraged at Trimalchio's praising Scylax so
warmly the slave put the bitch down upon the floor and sicked her on to
fight  Scylax as might have been expected from such a dog made the
whole room ring with his hideous barking and nearly shook the life out of
the little bitch which the slave called Pearl  Nor did the uproar end in
a dog fight a candelabrum was upset upon the table breaking the glasses
and spattering some of the guests with hot oil  As Trimalchio did not
wish to seem concerned at the loss he kissed the boy and ordered him to
climb upon his own back  The slave did not hesitate but mounting his
rocking-horse he beat Trimalchio's shoulders with his open palms
yelling with laughter Buck Buck  How many fingers do I hold up
When Trimalchio had in a measure regained his composure which took but
a little while he ordered that a huge vessel be filled with mixed wine
and that drinks be served to all the slaves sitting around our feet
adding as an afterthought If anyone refuses to drink pour it on his
head business is business but now's the time for fun




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-FIFTH

The dainties that followed this display of affability were of such a
nature that if any reliance is to be placed in my word the very mention
of them makes me sick at the stomach  Instead of thrushes fattened
chickens were served one to each of us and goose eggs with pastry caps
on them which same Trimalchio earnestly entreated us to eat informing
us that the chickens had all been boned  Just at that instant however
a lictor knocked at the dining-room door and a reveler clad in white
vestments entered followed by a large retinue  Startled at such pomp
I thought that the Praetor had arrived so I put my bare feet upon the
floor and started to get up but Agamemnon laughed at my anxiety and
said Keep your seat you idiot it's only Habinnas the sevir he's a
stone mason and if report speaks true he makes the finest tombstones
imaginable  Reassured by this information I lay back upon my couch and
watched Habinnasentrance with great curiosity  Already drunk and
wearing several wreaths his forehead smeared with perfume which ran down
into his eyes he advanced with his hands upon his wife's shoulders and
seating himself in the Praetor's place he called for wine and hot water
Delighted with his good humor Trimalchio called for a larger goblet for
himself and asked him at the same time how he had been entertained
We had everything except yourself for my heart and soul were here but
it was fine it was by Hercules  Scissa was giving a Novendial feast
for her slave whom she freed on his death-bed and it's my opinion
she'll have a large sum to split with the tax gatherers for the dead man
was rated at 50000 but everything went off well even if we did have to
pour half our wine on the bones of the late lamented




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SIXTH

But demanded Trimalchio what did you have for dinner'  I'll tell
you if I can answered he for my memory's so good that I often forget
my own name  Let's see for the first course we had a hog crowned with
a wine cup and garnished with cheese cakes and chicken livers cooked well
done beets of course and whole-wheat bread which I'd rather have
than white because it puts strength into you and when I take a crap
afterwards I don't have to yell  Following this came a course of
tarts served cold with excellent Spanish wine poured over warm honey
I ate several of the tarts and got the honey all over myself  Then there
were chick-peas and lupines all the smooth-shelled nuts you wanted and
an apple apiece but I got away with two and here they are tied up in
my napkin for I'll have a row on my hands if I don't bring some kind of
a present home to my favorite slave  Oh yes my wife has just reminded
me there was a haunch of bear-meat as a side dish Scintilla ate some of
it without knowing what it was and she nearly puked up her guts when she
found out  But as for me I ate more than a pound of it for it tasted
exactly like wild boar and says I if a bear eats a man shouldn't that
be all the more reason for a man to eat a bear  The last course was soft
cheese new wine boiled thick a snail apiece a helping of tripe liver
pate capped eggs turnips and mustard  But that's enough  Pickled
olives were handed around in a wooden bowl and some of the party
greedily snatched three handfuls we had ham too but we sent it back




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-SEVENTH

But why isn't Fortunata at the table Gaius  Tell me  What's that
Trimalchio replied don't you know her better than that  She wouldn't
touch even a drop of water till after the silver was put away and the
leftovers divided among the slaves  I'm going to beat it if she don't
take her place Habinnas threatened and started to get up and then
at a signal the slaves all called out together Fortunata four times
or more

She appeared girded round with a sash of greenish yellow below which a
cherry-colored tunic could be seen and she had on twisted anklets and
sandals worked in gold  Then wiping her hands upon a handkerchief which
she wore around her neck she seated herself upon the couch beside
Scintilla Habinnaswife and clapping her hands and kissing her My
dear she gushed is it really you  Fortunata then removed the
bracelets from her pudgy arms and held them out to the admiring
Scintilla and by and by she took off her anklets and even her yellow
hair-net which was twenty-four carats fine she would have us know
Trimalchio who was on the watch ordered every trinket to be brought to
him  You see these things don't you  he demanded they're what
women fetter us with  That's the way us poor suckers are done  These
ought to weigh six pounds and a half  I have an arm-band myself that
don't weigh a grain under ten pounds I bought it out of Mercury's
thousandths too  Finally for fear he would seem to be lying he
ordered the scales to be brought in and carried around to prove the
weights  And Scintilla was no better  She took off a small golden
vanity case which she wore around her neck and which she called her
Lucky Box and took from it two eardrops which in her turn she handed
to Fortunata to be inspected  Thanks to the generosity of my husband
she smirked no woman has better  What's that  Habinnas demanded
You kept on my trail to buy that glass bean for you if I had a
daughter I'll be damned if I wouldn't cut off her little ears  We'd
have everything as cheap as dirt if there were no women but we have to
piss hot and drink cold the way things are now  The women angry
though they were were laughing together in the meantime and exchanging
drunken kisses the one running on about her diligence as a housekeeper
and the other about the infidelities and neglect of her husband
Habinnas got up stealthily while they were clinging together in this
fashion and seizing Fortunata by the feet he tipped her over backwards
upon the couch  Let go  she screeched as her tunic slipped above her
knees then after pulling down her clothing she threw herself into
Scintilla's lap and hid with her handkerchief a face which was none
the more beautiful for its blushes




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-EIGHTH

After a short interval Trimalchio gave orders for the dessert to be
served whereupon the slaves took away all the tables and brought in
others and sprinkled the floor with sawdust mixed with saffron and
vermilion and also with powdered mica a thing I had never seen done
before  When all this was done Trimalchio remarked I could rest
content with this course for you have your second tables but if you've
something especially nice why bring it on  Meanwhile an Alexandrian
slave boy who had been serving hot water commenced to imitate a
nightingale and when Trimalchio presently called out Change your
tune we had another surprise for a slave sitting at Habinnasfeet
egged on I have no doubt by his own master bawled suddenly in a
singsong voice Meanwhile AEneas and all of his fleet held his course on
the billowy deep never before had my ears been assailed by a sound so
discordant for in addition to his barbarous pronunciation and the
raising and lowering of his voice he interpolated Atellane verses and
for the first time in my life Virgil grated on my nerves  When he had
to quit finally from sheer want of breath Did he ever have any
training Habinnas exclaimed no not he  I educated him by sending
him among the grafters at the fair so when it comes to taking off a
barker or a mule driver there's not his equal and the rogue's clever
too he's a shoemaker or a cook or a baker a regular jack of all
trades  But he has two faults and if he didn't have them he'd be
beyond all price he snores and he's been circumcised  And that's the
reason he never can keep his mouth shut and always has an eye open  I
paid three hundred dinars for him




CHAPTER THE SIXTY-NINTH

Yes Scintilla broke in and you've not mentioned all of his
accomplishments either he's a pimp too and I'm going to see that he's
branded she snapped  Trimalchio laughed  There's where the
Cappadocian comes out he said never cheats himself out of anything
and I admire him for it so help me Hercules I do  No one can show a
dead man a good time  Don't be jealous Scintilla we're next to you
women too believe me  As sure as you see me here safe and sound I
used to play at thrust and parry with Mamma my mistress and finally
even my master got suspicious and sent me back to a stewardship but keep
quiet tongue and I'll give you a cake  Taking all this as praise the
wretched slave pulled a small earthen lamp from a fold in his garment
and impersonated a trumpeter for half an hour or more while Habinnas
hummed with him holding his finger pressed to his lips  Finally the
slave stepped out into the middle of the floor and waved his pipes in
imitation of a flute-player then with a whip and a smock he enacted
the part of a mule-driver  At last Habinnas called him over and kissed
him and said as he poured a drink for him You get better all the time
Massa  I'm going to give you a pair of shoes  Had not the dessert been
brought in we would never have gotten to the end of these stupidities
Thrushes made of pastry and stuffed with nuts and raisins quinces with
spines sticking out so that they looked like sea-urchins  All this would
have been endurable enough had it not been for the last dish that was
served so revolting was this that we would rather have died of
starvation than to have even touched it  We thought that a fat goose
flanked with fish and all kinds of birds had been served until
Trimalchio spoke up  Everything you see here my friends said he
was made from the same stuff  With my usual keen insight I jumped to
the conclusion that I knew what that stuff was and turning to Agamemnon
I said I shall be greatly surprised if all those things are not made
out of excrement or out of mud at the very least I saw a like artifice
practiced at Rome during the Saturnalia




CHAPTER THE SEVENTIETH

I had not done speaking when Trimalchio chimed in As I hope to grow
fatter in fortune but not in figure my cook has made all this out of a
hog  It would be simply impossible to meet up with a more valuable
fellow he'd make you a fish out of a sow's coynte if that's what you
wanted a pigeon out of her lard a turtle-dove out of her ham and a hen
out of a knuckle of pork that's why I named him Daedalus in a happy
moment  I brought him a present of knives from Rome because he's so
smart they're made of Noric steel too  He ordered them brought in
immediately and looked them over with admiration even giving us the
chance to try their edges upon our cheeks  Then all of a sudden two
slaves came in carrying on as if they had been fighting at the fountain
at least each one had a water-jar hanging from a yoke around his neck
Trimalchio arbitrated their difference but neither would abide by his
decision and each one smashed the other's jar with a club  Perturbed at
the insolence of these drunken ruffians we watched both of them
narrowly while they were fighting and then what should come pouring
out of the broken jars but oysters and scallops which a slave picked up
and passed around in a dish  The resourceful cook would not permit
himself to be outdone by such refinements but served us with snails on a
silver gridiron and sang continually in a tremulous and very discordant
voice  I am ashamed to have to relate what followed for contrary to
all convention some long-haired boys brought in unguents in a silver
basin and anointed the feet of the reclining guests but before doing
this however they bound our thighs and ankles with garlands of flowers
They then perfumed the wine-mixing vessel with the same unguent and
poured some of the melted liquid into the lamps  Fortunata had by this
time taken a notion that she wanted to dance and Scintilla was doing
more hand-clapping than talking when Trimalchio called out
Philargyrus and you too Carrio you can both come to the table
even if you are green faction fans and tell your bedfellow Menophila
to come too  What would you think happened then  We were nearly
crowded off the couches by the mob of slaves that crowded into the
dining-room and almost filled it full  As a matter of fact I noticed
that our friend the cook who had made a goose out of a hog was placed
next to me and he stunk from sauces and pickle  Not satisfied with a
place at the table he immediately staged an impersonation of Ephesus the
tragedian and then he suddenly offered to bet his master that the greens
would take first place in the next circus games




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FIRST

Trimalchio was hugely tickled at this challenge  Slaves are men my
friends he observed but that's not all they sucked the same milk
that we did even if hard luck has kept them down and they'll drink the
water of freedom if I live to make a long story short I'm freeing all
of them in my will  To Philargyrus I'm leaving a farm and his
bedfellow too  Carrio will get a tenement house and his twentieth
and a bed and bedclothes to boot  I'm making Fortunata my heir and I
commend her to all my friends  I announce all this in public so that my
household will love me as well now as they will when I'm dead  They all
commenced to pay tribute to the generosity of their master when he
putting aside his trifling ordered a copy of his will brought in which
same he read aloud from beginning to end to the groaning accompaniment
of the whole household  Then looking at Habinnas What say you my
dearest friend he entreated you'll construct my monument in keeping
with the plans I've given you won't you  I earnestly beg that you carve
a little bitch at the feet of my statue some wreaths and some jars of
perfume and all of the fights of Petraites  Then I'll be able to live
even after I'm dead thanks to your kindness  See to it that it has a
frontage of one hundred feet and a depth of two hundred  I want fruit
trees of every kind planted around my ashes and plenty of vines too
for it's all wrong for a man to deck out his house when he's alive and
then have no pains taken with the one he must stay in for a longer time
and that's the reason I particularly desire that this notice be added

THIS MONUMENT DOES NOT 
DESCEND TO AN HEIR 

In any case I'll see to it through a clause in my will that I'm not
insulted when I'm dead  And for fear the rabble comes running up into my
monument to crap I'll appoint one of my freedmen custodian of my tomb
I want you to carve ships under full sail on my monument and me in my
robes of office sitting on my tribunal five gold rings on my fingers
pouring out coin from a sack for the people for I gave a dinner and two
dinars for each guest as you know  Show a banquet-hall too if you
can and the people in it having a good time  On my right you can place
a statue of Fortunata holding a dove and leading a little bitch on a
leash and my favorite boy and large jars sealed with gypsum so the
wine won't run out show one broken and a boy crying over it  Put a
sun-dial in the middle so that whoever looks to see what time it is must
read my name whether he wants to or not  As for the inscription think
this over carefully and see if you think it's appropriate

FAREWELL TRIMALCHIO
FAREWELL PASSERBY




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SECOND

When he had repeated these words Trimalchio began to weep copiously
Fortunata was crying already and so was Habinnas and at last the whole
household filled the dining-room with their lamentations just as if they
were taking part in a funeral  Even I was beginning to sniffle when
Trimalchio said Let's live while we can since we know we've all got to
die  I'd rather see you all happy anyhow so let's take a plunge in the
bath  You'll never regret it  I'll bet my life on that it's as hot as
a furnace  Fine business seconded Habinnas there's nothing suits
me better than making two days out of one and he got up in his bare
feet to follow Trimalchio who was clapping his hands  I looked at
Ascyltos  What do you think about this I asked  The very sight of a
bath will be the death of me  Let's fall in with his suggestion he
replied and while they are hunting for the bath we will escape in the
crowd  Giton led us out through the porch when we had reached this
understanding and we came to a door where a dog on a chain startled us
so with his barking that Ascyltos immediately fell into the fish-pond
As for myself I was tipsy and had been badly frightened by a dog that
was only a painting and when I tried to haul the swimmer out I was
dragged into the pool myself  The porter finally came to our rescue
quieted the dog by his appearance and pulled us shivering to dry land
Giton had ransomed himself by a very cunning scheme for what we had
saved for him from dinner he threw to the barking brute which then
calmed its fury and became engrossed with the food  But when with
chattering teeth we besought the porter to let us out at the door If
you think you can leave by the same door you came in at he replied
you're mistaken no guest is ever allowed to go out through the same
door he came in at some are for entrance others for exit




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-THIRD

What were we miserable wretches to do shut up in this newfangled
labyrinth  The idea of taking a hot bath had commenced to grow in favor
so we finally asked the porter to lead us to the place and throwing off
our clothing which Giton spread out in the hall to dry we went in
It was very small like a cold water cistern Trimalchio was standing
upright in it and one could not escape his disgusting bragging even
here  He declared that there was nothing nicer than bathing without a
mob around and that a bakery had formerly occupied this very spot
Tired out at last he sat down but when the echoes of the place tempted
him he lifted his drunken mouth to the ceiling and commenced murdering
the songs of Menacrates at least that is what we were told by those who
understood his language  Some of the guests joined hands and ran around
the edge of the pool making the place ring with their boisterous peals
of laughter others tried to pick rings up from the floor with their
hands tied behind them or else going down upon their knees tried to
touch the ends of their toes by bending backwards  We went down into the
pool while the rest were taking part in such amusements  It was being
heated for Trimalchio  When the fumes of the wine had been dissipated
we were conducted into another dining-room where Fortunata had laid out
her own treasures I noticed for instance that there were little bronze
fishermen upon the lamps the tables were of solid silver the cups were
porcelain inlaid with gold before our eyes wine was being strained
through a straining cloth  One of my slaves shaves his first beard
today Trimalchio remarked at length a promising honest thrifty
lad may he have no bad luck so let's get our skins full and stick
around till morning




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FOURTH

He had not ceased speaking when a cock crowed  Alarmed at this omen
Trimalchio ordered wine thrown under the table and told them to sprinkle
the lamps with it and he even went so far as to change his ring from his
left hand to his right  That trumpeter did not sound off without a
reason he remarked there's either a fire in the neighborhood or else
someone's going to give up the ghost  I hope it's none of us  Whoever
brings that Jonah in shall have a present  He had no sooner made this
promise than a cock was brought in from somewhere in the neighborhood
and Trimalchio ordered the cook to prepare it for the pot  That same
versatile genius who had but a short time before made birds and fish out
of a hog cut it up it was then consigned to the kettle and while
Daedalus was taking a long hot drink Fortunata ground pepper in a
boxwood mill  When these delicacies had been consumed Trimalchio looked
the slaves over  You haven't had anything to eat yet have you  he
asked  Get out and let another relay come on duty  Thereupon a second
relay came in  Farewell Gaius cried those going off duty and Hail
Gaius cried those coming on  Our hilarity was somewhat dampened soon
after for a boy who was by no means bad looking came in among the
fresh slaves  Trimalchio seized him and kissed him lingeringly
whereupon Fortunata asserting her rights in the house began to rail at
Trimalchio styling him an abomination who set no limits to his lechery
finally ending by calling him a dog Trimalchio flew into a rage at her
abuse and threw a wine cup at her head whereupon she screeched as if
she had had an eye knocked out and covered her face with her trembling
hands  Scintilla was frightened too and shielded the shuddering woman
with her garment  An officious slave presently held a cold water pitcher
to her cheek and Fortunata bent over it sobbing and moaning  But as for
Trimalchio What the hell's next  he gritted out this Syrian
dancing-whore don't remember anything  I took her off the auction block
and made her a woman among her equals didn't I  And here she puffs
herself up like a frog and pukes in her own nest she's a blockhead all
right not a woman  But that's the way it is if you're born in an attic
you can't sleep in a palace I'll see that this booted Cassandra's tamed
so help me my Genius I will  And I could have married ten million even
if I did only have two cents you know I'm not lying Let me give you a
tipsaid Agatho the perfumer to the lady next door when he pulled me
asidedon't let your line die out And here I've stuck the ax into my
own leg because I was a damned fool and didn't want to seem fickle  I'll
see to it that you're more careful how you claw me up sure as you're
born I will That you may realize how seriously I take what you've done
to me Habinnas I don't want you to put her statue on my tomb for fear
I'll be nagged even after I'm dead  And furthermore that she may know I
can repay a bad turn I won't have her kissing me when I'm laid out




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-FIFTH

When Trimalchio had launched this thunderbolt Habinnas commenced to
beg him to control his anger  There's not one of us but goes wrong
sometimes argued he we're not gods we're men  Scintilla also cried
out through her tears calling him Gaius and entreating him by his
guardian angel to be mollified  Trimalchio could restrain the tears no
longer  Habinnas he blubbered as you hope to enjoy your money spit
in my face if I've done anything wrong  I kissed him because he's very
thrifty not because he's a pretty boy  He can recite his division table
and read a book at sight he bought himself a Thracian uniform from his
savings from his rations and a stool and two dippers with his own
money too  He's worth my attention ain't he  But Fortunata won't see
it  Ain't that the truth you high-stepping hussy'  Let me beg you to
make the best of what you've got you shekite and don't make me show my
teeth my little darling or you'll find out what my temper's like
Believe me when once I've made up my mind I'm as fixed as a spike in a
beam  But let's think of the living  I hope you'll all make yourselves
at home gentlemen I was in your fix myself once but rose to what I am
now by my own merit  It's the brains that makes the man all the rest's
bunk  I buy well I sell well someone else will tell you a different
story but as for myself I'm fairly busting with prosperity  What
grunting-sow still bawling  I'll see to it that you've something to
bawl for but as I started to say it was my thrift that brought me to
my fortune  I was just as tall as that candlestick when I came over from
Asia every day I used to measure myself by it and I would smear my lips
with oil so my beard would sprout all the sooner  I was my master's
'mistressfor fourteen years for there's nothing wrong in doing what
your master orders and I satisfied my mistress too during that time
you know what I mean but I'll say no more for I'm not one of your
braggarts




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SIXTH

At last it came about by the will of the gods that I was master in the
house and I had the real master under my thumb then  What is there
left to tell  I was made co-heir with Caesar and came into a Senator's
fortune  But nobody's ever satisfied with what he's got so I embarked
in business  I won't keep you long in suspense I built five ships and
loaded them with wine worth its weight in gold it was then and sent
them to Rome  You'd think I'd ordered it so for every last one of them
foundered it's a fact no fairy tale about it and Neptune swallowed
thirty million sesterces in one day  You don't think I lost my pep do
you  By Hercules no  That was only an appetizer for me just as if
nothing at all had happened  I built other and bigger ships better
found too so no one could say I wasn't game  A big ship's a big
venture you know  I loaded them up with wine again bacon beans
Capuan perfumes and slaves Fortunata did the right thing in this
affair too for she sold every piece of jewelry and all her clothes into
the bargain and put a hundred gold pieces in my hand  They were the
nest-egg of my fortune  A thing's soon done when the gods will it
I cleared ten million sesterces by that voyage all velvet and bought
in all the estates that had belonged to my patron right away  I built
myself a house and bought cattle to resell and whatever I touched grew
just like a honeycomb  I chucked the game when I got to have an income
greater than all the revenues of my own country retired from business
and commenced to back freedmen  I never liked business anyhow as far as
that goes and was just about ready to quit when an astrologer a Greek
fellow he was and his name was Serapa happened to light in our colony
and he slipped me some information and advised me to quit  He was hep to
all the secrets of the gods told me things about myself that I'd
forgotten and explained everything to me from needle and thread up knew
me inside out he did and only stopped short of telling me what I'd had
for dinner the day before  You'd have thought he'd lived with me
always




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-SEVENTH

Habinnas you were there I think I'll leave it to you didn't he say
You took your wife out of a whore-house' you're as lucky in your
friends too no one ever repays your favor with another you own broad
estates you nourish a viper under your wing and why shouldn't I tell
it I still have thirty years four months and two days to live  I'll
also come into another bequest shortly  That's what my horoscope tells
me  If I can extend my boundaries so as to join Apulia I'll think I've
amounted to something in this life  I built this house with Mercury on
the job anyhow it was a hovel as you know it's a palace now  Four
dining-rooms twenty bed-rooms two marble colonnades a store-room
upstairs a bed-room where I sleep myself a sitting-room for this viper
a very good room for the porter a guest-chamber for visitors  As a
matter of fact Scaurus when he was here would stay nowhere else
although he has a family place on the seashore  I'll show you many other
things too in a jiffy believe me if you have an as you'll be rated
at what you have  So your humble servant who was a frog is now a king
Stychus bring out my funereal vestments while we wait the ones I'll be
carried out in some perfume too and a draught of the wine in that jar
I mean the kind I intend to have my bones washed in




CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-EIGHTH

It was not long before Stychus brought a white shroud and a
purple-bordered toga into the dining-room and Trimalchio requested us
to feel them and see if they were pure wool Then with a smile Take
care Stychus that the mice don't get at these things and gnaw them or
the moths either  I'll burn you alive if they do  I want to be carried
out in all my glory so all the people will wish me well  Then opening
a jar of nard he had us all anointed  I hope I'll enjoy this as well
when I'm dead he remarked as I do while I'm alive  He then ordered
wine to be poured into the punch-bowl Pretend said he that you're
invited to my funeral feast  The thing had grown positively
nauseating when Trimalchio beastly drunk by now bethought himself of
a new and singular diversion and ordered some horn-blowers brought into
the dining-room  Then propped up by many cushions he stretched
himself out upon the couch  Let on that I'm dead said he and say
something nice about me  The horn-blowers sounded off a loud funeral
march together and one in particular a slave belonging to an
undertaker made such a fanfare that he roused the whole neighborhood
and the watch which was patrolling the vicinity thinking Trimalchio's
house was afire suddenly smashed in the door and rushed in with their
water and axes as is their right raising a rumpus all their own  We
availed ourselves of this happy circumstance and leaving Agamemnon in
the lurch we took to our heels as though we were running away from a
real conflagration

VOLUME 3 FURTHER ADVENTURES OF ENCOLPIUS AND HIS COMPANIONS


CHAPTER THE SEVENTY-NINTH

There was no torch to light the way for us as we wandered around nor
did the silence of midnight give promise of our meeting any wayfarer with
a light in addition to this we were drunk and unfamiliar with the
district which would confuse one even in daylight so for the best part
of a mortal hour we dragged our bleeding feet over all the flints and
pieces of broken tile till we were extricated at last by Giton's
cleverness  This prudent youngster had been afraid of going astray on
the day before so he had taken care to mark all the pillars and columns
with chalk  These marks stood out distinctly even through the pitchy
night and by their brilliant whiteness pointed out the way for us as we
wandered about  Nevertheless we had no less cause for being in a sweat
even when we came to our lodging for the old woman herself had been
sitting and swilling so long with her guests that even if one had set her
afire she would not have known it  We would have spent the night on the
door-sill had not Trimalchio's courier come up in state with ten wagons
he hammered on the door for a short time and then smashed it in giving
us an entrance through the same breach  Hastening to the
sleeping-chamber I went to bed with my brother and burning with
passion as I was after such a magnificent dinner I surrendered myself
wholly to sexual gratification

Oh Goddesses and Gods that purple night
How soft the couch  And we embracing tight
With every wandering kiss our souls would meet
Farewell all mortal woes to die were sweet

But my self-congratulation was premature for I was overcome with wine
and when my unsteady hands relaxed their hold Ascyltos that
never-failing well-spring of iniquity stole the boy away from me in the
night and carried him to his own bed where he wallowed around without
restraint with a brother not his own while the latter not noticing
the fraud or pretending not to notice it went to sleep in a stranger's
arms in defiance of all human rights  Awaking at last I felt the bed
over and found that it had been despoiled of its treasure then by all
that lovers hold dear I swear I was on the verge of transfixing them
both with my sword and uniting their sleep with death  At last
however I adopted a more rational plan I spanked Giton into
wakefulness and glaring at Ascyltos Since you have broken faith by
this outrage I gritted out with a savage frown and severed our
friendship you had better get your things together at once and pick up
some other bottom for your abominations  He raised no objection to
this but after we had divided everything with scrupulous exactitude
Come on now he demanded and we'll divide the boy




CHAPTER THE EIGHTIETH

I thought this was a parting joke till he whipped out his sword with a
murderous hand  You'll not have this prize you're brooding over all to
yourself  Since I've been rejected I'll have to cut off my share with
this sword  I followed suit on my side and wrapping a mantle around
my left arm I put myself on guard for the duel  The unhappy boy
rendered desperate by our unreasoning fury hugged each of us tightly by
the knee and in tears he humbly begged that this wretched lodging-house
should not witness a Theban duel and that we would not pollute with
mutual bloodshed the sacred rites of a friendship that was as yet
unstained  If a crime must be committed he wailed here is my naked
throat turn your swords this way and press home the points  I ought to
be the one to die I broke the sacred pledge of friendship  We lowered
our points at these entreaties  I'll settle this dispute Ascyltos
spoke up let the boy follow whomsoever he himself wishes to follow
In that way he at least will have perfect freedom in choosing a
'brother Imagining that a relationship of such long standing had
passed into a tie of blood I was not at all uneasy so I snatched at
this proposition with precipitate eagerness and submitted the dispute to
the judge  He did not deliberate long enough to seem even to hesitate
for he got up and chose Ascyltos for a brother as soon as the last
syllable had passed my lips  At this decision I was thunder-struck
and threw myself upon the bed unarmed and just as I stood  Had I not
begrudged my enemy such a triumph I would have laid violent hands upon
myself  Flushed with success Ascyltos marched out with his prize and
abandoned in a strange town a comrade in the depths of despair one
whom but a little while before he had loved most unselfishly one whose
destiny was so like his own

As long as is expedient the name of friendship lives
Just as in dicing Fortune smiles or lowers
When good luck beckons then your friend his gleeful service gives
But basely flies when ruin o'er you towers
The strollers act their farces upon the stage each one his part

The father son the rich man all are here
But soon the page is turned upon the comic actor's art
The masque is dropped the make-ups disappear




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-FIRST

Nevertheless I did not indulge myself very long in tears being afraid
that Menelaus the tutor might drop in upon me all alone in the
lodging-house and catch me in the midst of my troubles so I collected my
baggage and with a heavy heart sneaked off to an obscure quarter near
the seashore  There I kept to my room for three days  My mind was
continually haunted by my loneliness and desertion and I beat my breast
already sore from blows  Why could not the earth have opened and
swallowed me I wailed aloud between the many deep-drawn groans or
the sea which rages even against the guiltless  Did I flee from
justice murder my ghost and cheat the arena in order that after so
many proofs of courage I might be left lying here deserted a beggar and
an exile in a lodging-house in a Greek town  And who condemned me to
this desolation'  A boy stained by every form of vice who by his own
confession ought to be exiled free through vice expert in vice whose
favors came through a throw of the dice who hired himself out as a girl
to those who knew him to be a boy  And as to the other what about him
In place of the manly toga he donned the woman's stola when he reached
the age of puberty he resolved even from his mother's womb never to
become a man in the slave's prison he took the woman's part in the
sexual act he changed the instrument of his lechery when he
double-crossed me abandoned the ties of a long-standing friendship
and shame upon him sold everything for a single night's dalliance
like any other street-walker  Now the lovers lie whole nights locked
in each other's arms and I suppose they make a mockery of my desolation
when they are resting up from the exhaustion caused by their mutual
excesses  But not with impunity  If I don't avenge the wrong they have
done me in their guilty blood I'm no free man




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-SECOND

I girded on my sword when I had said these words and fortifying my
strength with a heavy meal so that weakness would not cause me to lose
the battle I presently sallied forth into the public streets and rushed
through all the arcades like a maniac  But while with my face savagely
convulsed in a frown I was meditating nothing but bloodshed and
slaughter and was continually clapping my hand to the hilt of my sword
which I had consecrated to this I was observed by a soldier that is he
either was a real soldier or else he was some night-prowling thug who
challenged me  Halt  Who goes there  What legion are you from  Who's
your centurion  Since when have men in your outfit gone on pass in
white shoes  he retorted when I had lied stoutly about both centurion
and legion  Both my face and my confusion proved that I had been caught
in a lie so he ordered me to surrender my arms and to take care that I
did not get into trouble  I was held up as a matter of course and my
revenge balked I returned to my lodging-house and recovering by degrees
from my fright I began to be grateful to the boldness of the footpad
It is not wise to place much reliance upon any scheme because Fortune
has a method of her own




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-THIRD

Nevertheless I found it very difficult to stifle my longing for
revenge and after tossing half the night in anxiety I arose at dawn
and in the hope of mitigating my mental sufferings and of forgetting my
wrongs I took a walk through all the public arcades and entered a
picture-gallery which contained a wonderful collection of pictures in
various styles  I beheld works from the hand of Zeuxis still undimmed
by the passage of the years and contemplated not without a certain awe
the crude drawings of Protogenes which equalled the reality of nature
herself but when I stood before the work of Apelles the kind which the
Greeks call Monochromatic verily I almost worshipped for the
outlines of the figures were drawn with such subtlety of touch and were
so life-like in their precision that you would have thought their very
souls were depicted  Here an eagle was soaring into the sky bearing the
shepherd of Mount Ida to heaven there the comely Hylas was struggling
to escape from the embrace of the lascivious Naiad  Here too was
Apollo cursing his murderous hand and adorning his unstrung lyre with
the flower just created  Standing among these lovers which were only
painted It seems that even the gods are wracked by love I cried
aloud as if I were in a wilderness  Jupiter could find none to his
taste even in his own heaven so he had to sin on earth but no one was
betrayed by him  The nymph who ravished Hylas would have controlled her
passion had she thought Hercules was coming to forbid it  Apollo
recalled the spirit of a boy in the form of a flower and all the lovers
of Fable enjoyed Love's embraces without a rival but I took as a comrade
a friend more cruel than Lycurgus  But at that very instant as I was
telling my troubles to the winds a white-haired old man entered the
picture-gallery his face was care-worn and he seemed I know not why
to give promise of something great although he bestowed so little care
upon his dress that it was easily apparent that he belonged to that class
of literati which the wealthy hold in contempt  I am a poet he
remarked when he had approached me and stood at my side and one of no
mean ability I hope that is if anything is to be inferred from the
crowns which gratitude can place even upon the heads of the unworthy
Then why you demand are you dressed so shabbily  For that very reason
love or art never yet made anyone rich

The trader trusts his fortune to the sea and takes his gains
The warrior for his deeds is girt with gold
The wily sycophant lies drunk on purple counterpanes
Young wives must pay debauchees or they're cold
But solitary shivering in tatters Genius stands
Invoking a neglected art for succor at its hands




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-FOURTH

It is certainly true that a man is hated when he declares himself an
enemy to all vice and begins to follow the right road in life because
in the first place his habits are different from those of other people
for who ever approved of anything to which he took exceptions  Then
they whose only ambition is to pile up riches don't want to believe that
men can possess anything better than that which they have themselves
therefore they use every means in their power to so buffet the lovers
of literature that they will seem in their proper place below the
moneybags  I know not why it should be so I said with a sigh but
Poverty is the sister of Genius  You have good reason the old man
replied to deplore the status of men of letters  No I answered
that was not the reason for my sigh there is another and far weightier
cause for my grief  Then in accordance with the human propensity of
pouring one's personal troubles into another's ears I explained my
misfortune to him and dwelt particularly upon Ascyltosperfidy  Oh
how I wish that this enemy who is the cause of my enforced continence
could be mollified I cried with many a groan but he is an old hand
at robbery and more cunning than the pimps themselves  My frankness
pleased the old man who attempted to comfort me and to beguile my
sorrow he related the particulars of an amorous intrigue in which he
himself had played a part




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-FIFTH

When I was attached to the Quaestor's staff in Asia I was quartered
with a family at Pergamus  I found things very much to my liking there
not only on account of the refined comfort of my apartments but also
because of the extreme beauty of my host's son  For the latter reason
I had recourse to strategy in order that the father should never suspect
me of being a seducer  So hotly would I flare up whenever the abuse
of handsome boys was even mentioned at the table and with such
uncompromising sternness would I protest against having my ears insulted
by such filthy talk that I came to be looked upon especially by the
mother as one of the philosophers  I was conducting the lad to the
gymnasium before very long and superintending his conduct taking
especial care all the while that no one who could debauch him should
ever enter the house  Then there came a holiday the school was closed
and our festivities had rendered us too lazy to retire properly so we
lay down in the dining-room  It was just about midnight and I knew he
was awake so I murmured this vow in a very low voiceOh Lady Venus
could I but kiss this lad and he not know it I would give him a pair of
turtle-doves tomorrow On hearing the price offered for this favor the
boy commenced to snore  Then bending over the pretending sleeper I
snatched a fleeting kiss or two  Satisfied with this beginning I arose
early in the morning brought a fine pair of turtle-doves to the eager
lad and absolved myself from my vow




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-SIXTH

Next night when the same opportunity presented itself I changed my
petitionIf I can feel him all over with a wanton handI vowedand
he not know it I will give him two of the gamest fighting-cocks for his
silenceThe lad nestled closer to me of his own accord on hearing this
offer and I truly believe that he was afraid that I was asleep  I made
short work of his apprehensions on that score however by stroking and
fondling his whole body  I worked myself into a passionate fervor that
was just short of supreme gratification  Then when day dawned I made
him happy with what I had promised him  When the third night gave me
my chance I bent close to the ear of the rascal who pretended to be
asleep Immortal godsI whisperedif I can take full and complete
satisfaction of my love from this sleeping beauty I will tomorrow
present him with the best Macedonian pacer in the market in return for
this bliss provided that he does not know it Never had the lad slept
so soundly  First I filled my hands with his snowy breasts then I
pressed a clinging kiss upon his mouth but I finally focused all my
energies upon one supreme delight  Early in the morning he sat up in
bed awaiting my usual gift  It is much easier to buy doves and
game-cocks than it is to buy a pacer as you know and aside from that
I was also afraid that so valuable a present might render my motive
subject to suspicion so after strolling around for some hours I
returned to the house and gave the lad nothing at all except a kiss
He looked all around threw his arms about my neck Tell me master'
he criedwhere's the pacer'The difficulty of getting one fine
enough has compelled me to defer the fulfillment of my promiseI
repliedbut I will make it good in a few daysThe lad easily
understood the true meaning of my answer and his countenance betrayed
his secret resentment




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-SEVENTH

In the meantime by breaking this vow I had cut myself off from the
avenue of access which I had contrived but I returned to the attack all
the same when the opportunity came  In a few days a similar occasion
brought about the very same conditions as before and the instant I heard
his father snoring I began pleading with the lad to receive me again
into his good graces that is to say that he ought to suffer me to
satisfy myself with him and he in turn could do whatever his own
distended member desired  He was very angry however and would say
nothing at all exceptEither you go to sleep or I'll call father'
But no obstacle is so difficult that depravity cannot twist around it and
even while he threatenedI'll call fatherI slipped into his bed and
took my pleasure in spite of his half-hearted resistance  Nor was he
displeased with my improper conduct for although he complained for a
while that he had been cheated and made a laughing-stock and that his
companions to whom he had bragged of his wealthy friend had made sport
of him But you'll see that I'll not be like youhe whispereddo it
again if you want to All misunderstandings were forgotten and I was
readmitted into the lad's good graces  Then I slipped off to sleep
after profiting by his complaisance  But the youth in the very flower
of maturity and just at the best age for passive pleasure was by no
means satisfied with only one repetition so he roused me out of a heavy
sleep Isn't there something you'd like to dohe whispered  The
pastime had not begun to cloy as yet and somehow or other what with
panting and sweating and wriggling he got what he wanted and worn out
with pleasure I dropped off to sleep again Less than an hour had passed
when he began to punch me with his handWhy are we not busyhe
whispered  I flew into a violent rage at being disturbed so many times
and threatened him in his own wordsEither you go to sleep or I'll
call father'




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-EIGHTH

Heartened up by this story I began to draw upon his more comprehensive
knowledge as to the ages of the pictures and as to certain of the stories
connected with them upon which I was not clear and I likewise inquired
into the causes of the decadence of the present age in which the most
refined arts had perished and among them painting which had not left
even the faintest trace of itself behind Greed of money he replied
has brought about these unaccountable changes  In the good old times
when virtue was her own reward the fine arts flourished and there was
the keenest rivalry among men for fear that anything which could be of
benefit to future generations should remain long undiscovered  Then it
was that Democritus expressed the juices of all plants and spent his
whole life in experiments in order that no curative property should lurk
unknown in stone or shrub  That he might understand the movements of
heaven and the stars Eudoxus grew old upon the summit of a lofty
mountain three times did Chrysippus purge his brain with hellebore
that his faculties might be equal to invention  Turn to the sculptors if
you will Lysippus perished from hunger while in profound meditation upon
the lines of a single statue and Myron who almost embodied the souls of
men and beasts in bronze could not find an heir  And we sodden with
wine and women cannot even appreciate the arts already practiced we
only criticise the past We learn only vice and teach it too  What has
become of logic of astronomy  Where is the exquisite road to wisdom
Who even goes into a temple to make a vow that he may achieve eloquence
or bathe in the fountain of wisdom  And they do not pray for good health
and a sound mind before they even set foot upon the threshold of the
temple one promises a gift if only he may bury a rich relative another
if he can but dig up a treasure and still another if he is permitted to
amass thirty millions of sesterces in safety  The Senate itself the
exponent of all that should be right and just is in the habit of
promising a thousand pounds of gold to the capitol and that no one may
question the propriety of praying for money it even decorates Jupiter
himself with spoils Do not hesitate therefore at expressing your
surprise at the deterioration of painting since by all the gods and men
alike a lump of gold is held to be more beautiful than anything ever
created by those crazy little Greek fellows Apelles and Phydias




CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-NINTH

But I see that your whole attention is held by that picture which
portrays the destruction of Troy so I will attempt to unfold the story
in verse

And now the tenth harvest beheld the beleaguered of Troia

Worn out with anxiety fearing the honor of Calchas

The prophet hung wavering deep in the blackest despair

Apollo commanded  The forested peaks of Mount Ida

Were felled and dragged down the hewn timbers were fitted to fashion

A war-horse  Unfilled is a cavity left and this cavern

Roofed over capacious enough for a camp  Here lie hidden

The raging impetuous valor of ten years of warfare

Malignant Greek troops pack the recess lurk in their own offering

Alas my poor country  We thought that their thousand grim war-ships

Were beaten and scattered our arable lands freed from warfare

Thinscription cut into the horse and the crafty behavior

Of Sinon his mind ever powerful for evil affirmed it

Delivered from war now the crowd carefree hastens to worship

And pours from the portals  Their cheeks wet with weeping the joy

Of their tremulous souls brings to eyes tears which terror

Had banished  Laocoon priest unto Neptune with hair loosed

An outcry evoked from the mob he drew back his javelin

And launched it  The belly of wood was his target  The weapon

Recoiled for the fates stayed his hand and this artifice won us

His feeble hand nerved he anew and the lofty sides sounded

His two-edged ax tried them severely  The young troops in ambush

Gasped  And as long as the reverberations re-echoed

The wooden mass breathed out a fear that was not of its own

Imprisoned the warriors advance to take Troia a captive

And finish the struggle by strategem new and unheard of

Behold  Other portents Where Tenedos steep breaks the ocean

Where great surging billows dash high to be broken and leap back

To form a deep hollow of calm and resemble the plashing

Of oars carried far through the silence of night as when ships pass

And drive through the calm as it smashes against their fir bows

Then backward we look towards the rocks the tide carries two serpents

That coil and uncoil as they come and their breasts which are swollen

Aside dash the foam as the bows of tall ships and the ocean

Is lashed by their tails their manes free on the water as savage

As even their eyes now a blinding beam kindles the billows

The sea with their hissing is sibilant  All stare in terror

Laocoon's twin sons in Phrygian raiment are standing

With priests wreathed for sacrifice  Them did the glistening serpents

Enfold in their coils  With their little hands shielding their faces

The boys neither thinking of self but each one of his brother

Fraternal love's sacrifice  Death himself slew those poor children

By means of their unselfish fear for each other  The father

A helper too feeble now throws himself prone on their bodies

The serpents now glutted with death coil around him and drag him

To earth  And the priest at his altar a victim lies beating

The ground  Thus the city of Troy doomed to sack and destruction

First lost her own gods by profaning their shrines and their worship

The full moon now lifted her luminous beam and the small stars

Led forth with her torch all ablaze when the Greeks drew the bolts

And poured forth their warriors on Priam's sons buried in darkness

And sodden with wine  First the leaders made trial of their weapons

Just as the horse when unhitched from Thessalian neck-yoke

First tosses his head and his mane ere to pasture he rushes

They draw their swords brandish their shields and rush into the battle

One slays the wine-drunken Trojans prolonging their dreams

To death which ends all  Still another takes brands from the altars

And calls upon Troy's sacred temples to fight against Trojans




CHAPTER THE NINTIETH

Some of the public who were loafing in the portico threw stones at the
reciting Eumolpus and he taking note of this tribute to his genius
covered his head and bolted out of the temple  Fearing they might take
me for a poet too I followed after him in his flight and came to the
seashore where we stopped as soon as we were out of range  Tell me
I demanded what are you going to do about that disease of yours
You've loafed with me less than two hours and you've talked more often
like a poet than you have like a human being  For this reason I'm not
at all surprised that the rabble chases you with rocks  I'm going to
load my pockets with stones too and whenever you begin to go out of
your head I'm going to let blood out of it  His expression changed
My dear young man said he today is not the first time I have had
such compliments showered upon me the audience always applauds me in
this fashion when I go into the theatre to recite anything but I'll
abstain from this sort of diet for the whole day for fear of having
trouble with you  Good I replied we'll dine together if you'll
swear off crankiness for the day  So saying I gave the housekeeper
the orders for our little supper and we went straight off to the baths




CHAPTER THE NINETY-FIRST

There I catch sight of Giton laden with towels and scrapers leaning
downhearted and embarrassed against the wall  You could see that he did
not serve of his own free will  Then that I might assure myself that I
saw aright Take pity on me brother he cried turning towards me a
face lighted up with joy there are no arms here I can speak freely
take me away from that bloody robber and punish your penitent judge as
severely as you like  To have perished should you wish it will be a
consolation great enough in my misery  Fearing some one might overhear
our plans I bade him hush his complaints and leaving Eumolpus behind
for he was reciting a poem in the bath I pull Giton down a dark and
dirty passage after me and fly with all speed to my lodgings  Arriving
there I slam the door shut embrace him convulsively and press my face
against his which is all wet with tears  For a long time neither of us
could find his voice and as for the lad his shapely bosom was heaving
continuously with choking sobs  Oh the disgraceful inconsistency of it
all I cried for I love you still although you abandoned me and no
scar from that gaping wound is left upon this breast  What can you say
that will justify you in yielding your love to a stranger  Did I merit
such an affront'  He held his head higher when he found that he was
loved

For one to love and at the same time blame
That were a labor Hercules to tame
Conflicting passions yield in Cupid's name

And furthermore I went on I was not the one that laid the cause of
our love before another judge but I will complain no more I will
remember nothing if you will prove your penitence by keeping faith
He wiped his face upon his mantle while I poured out these words with
groans and tears  Encolpius said he I beseech you I appeal to your
honest recollection did I leave you or did you throw me over  For my
part I admit and openly at that that I sought refuge with the
stronger when I beheld two armed men  I kissed that bosom so full of
prudence threw my arms around his neck and pressed him tightly against
my breast that he might see unmistakably that he had gotten back into my
good graces and that our friendship lived again in perfect confidence




CHAPTER THE NINETY-SECOND

Night had fallen by this time and the woman to whom I had given my order
had prepared supper when Eumolpus knocked at the door  How many of you
are there  I called out and as I spoke I peeped cautiously through a
chink in the door to see if Ascyltos had come with him then as I
perceived that he was the only guest I quickly admitted him  He threw
himself upon the pallet and caught sight of Giton waiting table
whereupon he nodded his head I like your Ganymede he remarked
this day promises a good ending  I did not take kindly to such an
inquisitive beginning fearing that I had let another Ascyltos into my
lodging  Eumolpus stuck to his purpose  I like you better than the
whole bathful he remarked when the lad had served him with wine then
he thirstily drained the cup dry and swore that never before had he
tasted a wine with such a satisfying tang to it  While I was bathing
he went on I was almost beaten up for trying to recite a poem to the
people sitting around the basin and when I had been thrown out of the
baths just like I was out of the theatre I hunted through every nook
and cranny of the building callingEncolpius Encolpiusat the top of
my voice  A naked youth at the other end who had lost his clothes was
bawling just as loudly and no less angrily for Giton  As for myself the
slaves took me for a maniac and mimicked me in the most insolent manner
but a large crowd gathered around him clapping its hands in awe-struck
admiration for so heavy and massive were his private parts that you
would have thought that the man himself was but an appendage of his own
member  Oh such a man  He could do his bit all right  I haven't a
doubt but that he could begin on the day before and never finish till the
day after the next  And he soon found a friend of course some Roman
knight or other I don't know his name but he bears a bad reputation so
they say threw his own mantle around the wanderer and took him off home
with himself hoping I suppose to have the sole enjoyment of so huge a
prize  But I couldn't get my own clothing back from the officious bath
attendant till I found some one who could identify me which only goes to
show that it is more profitable to rub up the member than it is to polish
the mind  While Eumolpus was relating all this I changed countenance
continually elated naturally at the mishaps of my enemy and vexed at
his good fortune but I controlled my tongue nevertheless as if I knew
nothing about the episode and read aloud the bill of fare  Hardly had
I finished when our humble meal was served  The food was plain but
succulent and nutritious and the famished scholar Eumolpus fell to
ravenously

Kind Providence unto our needs has tempered its decrees
And met our wants our carping plaints to still
Green herbs and berries hanging on their rough and brambly sprays
Suffice our hunger's gnawing pangs to kill
What fool would thirst upon a river's brink  Or stand and freeze
In icy blasts when near a cozy fire
The law sits armed outside the door adulterers to seize
The chaste bride guiltless gratifies desire
All Nature lavishes her wealth to meet our just demands
But spurred by lust of pride we stop at naught to gain our ends

Our philosopher began to moralize when he had gorged himself leveling
many critical shafts at those who hold every-day things in contempt
esteeming nothing except what is rare




CHAPTER THE NINETY-THIRD

To their perverted taste he went on everything one may have
lawfully is held cheap and the appetite tickled only by forbidden
indulgences delights in what is most difficult to obtain

The pheasant from Colchis the wild-fowl from African shores

Because they are dainties the parvenu's palate adores

The white-feathered goose and the duck in his bright-colored plumes

Must nourish the rabble they're common so them Fashion dooms

The wrasse brought from dangerous Syrtis is much more esteemed

When fishing-boats founder  And even the mullet is deemed

No matter how heavy a weight on the market  The whore

Displaces the wife and in perfumes the cinnamon more

Is esteemed than the rose  So whatever we have we despise

And whatever we have not we think a superlative prize

Is this the way in which you keep your promise not to recite a single
verse today  I demanded bear in mind your promise and spare us at
least for we have thrown no rocks at you yet  If a single one of those
fellows drinking under this very roof were to smell out a poet in their
midst he would arouse the whole neighborhood and involve all of us in
the same misunderstanding  Giton who was one of the gentlest of lads
took me to task for having spoken in that manner denying that I did
rightly in criticising my elders and at the same time forgetting my
duties as host by offering an affront to one whom I had invited out of
kindness  And much more full of moderation and propriety which was in
exquisite keeping with his good looks




CHAPTER THE NINETY-FOURTH

Happy the mother cried Eumolpus who bore such a son as you  May
your fortune be in keeping with your merit Beauty and wisdom are rarely
found mixed  And that you may not think that all your words are wasted
know that you have found a lover  I will fill my verses with your
praise  I will act as your guardian and your tutor following you even
when you bid me stay behind  Nor can Encolpius take offense he loves
another  The soldier who took my sword from me did Eumolpus a good
turn too otherwise the rage which I had felt against Ascyltos would
have been quenched in the blood of Eumolpus Seeing what was in the wind
Giton slipped out of the room pretending he was going after water and
by this diplomatic retreat he put an end to my fury  Then as my anger
cooled little by little Eumolpus I said rather than have you
entertain designs of such a nature I would even prefer to have you
spouting poetry  I am hot-tempered and you are lecherous see how
uncongenial two such dispositions must be  Take me for a maniac humor
my malady in other words get out quick  Taken completely aback by
this onslaught Eumolpus crossed the threshold of the room without
stopping to ask the reason for my wrath and immediately slammed the door
shut penning me in as I was not looking for any move of that kind then
having quickly removed the key he hurried away in search of Giton
Finding that I was locked in I decided to hang myself and had already
fastened my belt to the bedstead which stood alongside of the wall and
was engaged in fastening the noose around my neck when the doors were
unlocked and Eumolpus came in with Giton recalling me to light when I
was just about to turn the fatal goal-post  Giton was greatly wrought up
and his grief turned to fury seizing me with both hands he threw me
upon the bed  If you think Encolpius he shrieked that you can
contrive to die before I do you're wrong  I thought of suicide first
I hunted for a sword in Ascyltoshouse I would have thrown myself from
a precipice if I had not found you  You know that Death is never far
from those who seek him so take your turn and witness the spectacle you
wished to see  So saying he snatched a razor from Eumolpusservant
slashed his throat once twice and fell down at our feet  I uttered a
loud cry rushed to him as he fell and sought the road to death by the
same steel Giton however showed not the faintest trace of any wound
nor was I conscious of feeling any pain  The razor it turned out was
untempered and dull and was used to imbue boy apprentices with the
confidence of the experienced barber  Hence it was in a sheath and for
the reason given above the servant was not alarmed when the blade was
snatched nor did Eumolpus break in upon this farcical death scene




CHAPTER THE NINETY-FIFTH

The landlord made his appearance with a part of our little supper while
this lover's comedy was being enacted and taking in the very disorderly
spectacle which we presented lying there and wallowing as we were
Are you drunk he demanded or are you runaway slaves or both
Who turned up that bed there  What's the meaning of all  these sneaking
preparations  You didn't want to pay the room-rent you didn't by
Hercules you didn't you wanted to wait till night and run away into the
public streets but that won't go here  This is no widow's joint I'll
show you that not yet it ain't  This place belongs  to Marcus
Manicius  So you threaten do you'  yelled Eumolpus giving the
fellow a resounding slap in the face  At this the latter threw a small
earthenware pitcher which had been emptied by the draughts of successive
guests at Eumolpushead and cut open the forehead of his cursing
adversary then he skipped out of the room  Infuriated at such an
insult Eumolpus snatched up a wooden candlestick ran in pursuit of his
retreating foeman and avenged his broken head with a shower of blows
The entire household crowded around as did a number of drunken lodgers
but I seized this opportunity of retaliating and locked Eumolpus out
retorting his own trick upon the quarrelsome fellow and found myself
without a rival as it were able to enjoy my room and my night's
pleasure as well  In the meantime Eumolpus locked out as he was
was being very roughly handled by the cooks and scullions of the
establishment one aimed a spitful of hissing-hot guts at his eyes
another grabbed a two-tined fork in the pantry and put himself on guard
But worst of all a blear-eyed old hag girded round with a filthy apron
and wearing wooden clogs which were not mates dragged in an immense dog
on a chain and sicked him upon Eumolpus but he beat off all attacks
with his candlestick




CHAPTER THE NINETY-SIXTH

We took in the entire performance through a hole in the folding-doors
this had been made but a short time before when the handle had been
broken and jerked out and I wished him joy of his beating  Giton
however forgetting everything except his own compassion thought we
ought to open the door and succor Eumolpus in his peril but being still
angry I could not restrain my hand clenching my fist I rapped his
pitying head with my sharp knuckles  In tears he sat upon the bed
while I applied each eye in turn to the opening filling myself up as
with a dainty dish with Eumolpusmisfortunes and gloating over their
prolongation when Bargates agent for the building called from his
dinner was carried into the midst of the brawl by two chair-men for he
had the gout  He carried on for some time against drunkards and fugitive
slaves in a savage tone and with a barbarous accent and then looking
around and catching sight of Eumolpus What he exclaimed are you
here nay prince of poets and these damned slaves don't scatter at once
and stop their brawling  Then whispering in Eumolpusear My
bedfellow's got an idea that she's finer-haired than I am lampoon her
in a poem if you think anything of me and makeer ashamed




CHAPTER THE NINETY-SEVENTH

Eumolpus was speaking privately with Bargates when a crier attended by a
public slave entered the inn accompanied by a medium-sized crowd of
outsiders  Waving a torch that gave out more smoke than light he
announced Strayed from the baths a short time ago a boy about sixteen
years of age curly headed a minion handsome answers to the name of
Giton  One thousand sesterces reward will be paid to anyone bringing him
back or giving information as to his whereabouts  Ascyltos dressed in
a tunic of many colors stood not far from the crier holding out a
silver tray upon which was piled the reward as evidence of good faith
I ordered Giton to get under the bed immediately telling him to stick
his hands and feet through the rope netting which supported the mattress
and just as Ulysses of old had clung to the ram so he stretched out
beneath the mattress would evade the hands of the hunters  And Giton
did not hesitate at obeying this order but fastened his hands in the
netting for a moment outdoing Ulysses in his own cunning  For fear of
leaving room for suspicion I piled covers upon my pallet leaving the
impression of a single person of my own stature  Meanwhile Ascyltos in
company with the magistrate's servant had ransacked all the rooms and
had come at last to mine where he entertained greater hopes of success
because he found the doors carefully barred  The public slave loosened
the bolts by inserting the edge of his ax in the chink  I threw myself
at Ascyltosfeet begging him by the memory of our friendship and our
companionship in suffering to show me my brother safe and sound and
furthermore that my simulated prayers might carry conviction I added
I know very well Ascyltos that you have come here seeking  my  life
If not  why  the axes

Well fatten your grudge then  Here's my neck  Pour out that blood
you seek to shed under pretext of a search  Ascyltos repelled this
suspicion affirming that he sought nothing except his own fugitive and
desired the death of neither man nor suppliant and least of all did he
wish to harm one whom now that their quarrel was over he regarded as
his dearest friend




CHAPTER THE NINETY-EIGHTH

The public servant however was not derelict in the performance of his
duty for snatching a cane from the innkeeper he poked underneath the
bed ransacking every corner even to the cracks in the wall  Twisting
his body out of reach and cautiously drawing a full breath Giton
pressed his mouth against the very bugs themselves The pair had
scarcely left the room when Eumolpus burst in in great excitement for
the doors had been broken and could keep no one out The thousand
sesterces are mine he shouted I'll follow that crier out and tell him
Giton is in your power and it will serve you right too  Seeing that
his mind was made up I embraced his knees and besought him not to kill a
dying man  You might have some reason for being excited I said if
you could produce the missing boy but you cannot as the thing stands
now for he escaped into the crowd and I have not even a suspicion as to
where he has gone  Get the lad back Eumolpus for heaven's sake even
if you do restore him to Ascyltos I had just succeeded in persuading
him to believe all this when Giton nearly suffocated from holding his
breath suddenly sneezed three times and shook the bed  Eumolpus turned
at the commotion  Hello Giton he exclaimed glad to see you  Then
he turned back the mattress and discovered an Ulysses who even a ravenous
Cyclops might have spared thereupon he faced me You robber said he
what does all this mean You hadn't the nerve to tell me the truth even
when you were caught  If the god that umpires human affairs hadn't
forced a sign from this boy as he hung there I would be wandering from
one pot-house to another like a fool  But Giton was far more tactful
than I first of all he dressed the cut upon Eumolpusforehead with
spider's web soaked in oil he then exchanged the poet's torn clothing
for his own cloak this done he embraced the old gentleman who was
already somewhat mollified and poulticed him with kisses  Dearest of
fathers he cried we are entirely in your hands  In yours alone  If
you love your Giton do your best to save him  Would that some cruel
flame might devour me alone or that the wintry sea might swallow me
for I am the cause for all these crimes  Two enemies would be reconciled
if I should perish  Moved by our troubles but particularly stirred by
Giton's caresses You are fools exclaimed Eumolpus you certainly
are here you are gifted with talents enough to make your fortunes and
you still lead a life of misery and every day you bring new torments
upon yourselves as the fruits of your own acts

VOLUME 4 ENCOLPIUS GITON AND EUMOLPUS ESCAPE BY SEA


CHAPTER THE NINETY-NINTH

I have always and everywhere lived such a life that each passing day was
spent as though that light would never return that is in tranquillity
Put aside those thoughts which worry you if you wish to follow my lead
Ascyltos persecutes you here get out of his way  I am about to start
for foreign parts you may come with me  I have taken a berth on a
vessel which will probably weigh anchor this very night  I am well known
on board and we shall be well received

Leave then thy home and seek a foreign shore
Brave youth for thee thy destiny holds more
To no misfortune yield  The Danube far
Shall know thy spirit and the polar star
And placid Nile and they who dwell in lands
Where sunrise starts or they where sunset ends
A new Ulysses treads on foreign sands

To me this advice seemed both sound and practical because it would
free me from any annoyance by Ascyltos and because it gave promise of a
happier life  I was overcome by the kindly sympathy of Eumolpus and was
especially sorry for the latest injury I had done him  I began to repent
my jealousy which had been the cause of so many unpleasant happenings
and with many tears I begged and pled with him to admit me into favor
as lovers cannot control their furious jealousy and vowing at the same
time that I would not by word or deed give him cause for offense in the
future  And he like a learned and cultivated gentleman ought to remove
all irritation from his mind and leave no trace of it behind  The snows
belong upon the ground in wild and uncultivated regions but where the
earth has been beautified by the conquest of the plough the light snow
melts away while you speak of it  And so it is with anger in the heart
in savage minds it lingers long it glides quickly away from the
cultured  That you may experience the truth of what you say exclaimed
Eumolpus see  I end my anger with a kiss  May good luck go with us
Get your baggage together and follow me or go on ahead if you prefer
While he was speaking a knock sounded at the door and a sailor with a
bristling beard stood upon the threshold  You're hanging in the wind
Eumolpus said he as if you didn't know that son-of-a-bitch of a
skipper  Without further delay we all got up  Eumolpus ordered his
servant who had been asleep for some time to bring his baggage out
Giton and I pack together whatever we have for the voyage and after
praying to the stars we went aboard




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDREDTH

We picked out a retired spot on the poop and Eumolpus dozed off as it
was not yet daylight  Neither Giton nor myself could get a wink of
sleep however  Anxiously I reflected that I had received Eumolpus as a
comrade a rival more formidable than Ascyltos and that thought tortured
me  But reason soon put my uneasiness to flight  It is unfortunate
said I to myself that the lad has so taken our friend's fancy but
what of it  Is not nature's every masterpiece common to all  The sun
shines upon all alike  The moon with her innumerable train of stars
lights even the wild beasts to their food  What can be more beautiful
than water

Yet it flows for common use  Shall love alone then be stolen rather
than be regarded as a prize to be won  No indeed I desire no possession
unless the world envies me for possessing it  A solitary old man can
scarcely become a serious rival even should he wish to take advantage
he would lose it through lack of breath  When but without any
confidence I had arrived at these conclusions and beguiled my uneasy
spirit I covered my head with my tunic and began to feign sleep when
all of a sudden as though Fortune were bent upon annihilating my peace
of mind a voice upon the ship's deck gritted out something like this
So he fooled me after all As this voice which was a man's and was
only too familiar struck my ears my heart fluttered  And then a woman
equally furious spat out more spitefully still If only some god would
put Giton into my hands what a fine time I would give that runaway
Stunned by these unexpected words we both turned pale as death  I was
completely terrified and as though I were enveloped in some turbulent
nightmare was a long time finding my voice but at last with trembling
hands I tugged at the hem of Eumolpusclothing just as he was sinking
into slumber  Father I quavered on your word of honor can you tell
me whose ship this is and whom she has aboard  Peeved at being
disturbed So he snapped this was the reason you wished to have us
quartered in the most inaccessible spot on deck was it  So we could get
no rest  What good will it do you when I've informed you that Lycas of
Tarentum is master of this ship and that he carries Tryphaena as an exile
to Tarentum




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIRST

I shivered horror-struck at this thunderbolt and beating my throat
Oh Destiny I wailed you've vanquished me completely at last  As
for Giton he fell in a faint upon my bosom and remained unconscious for
quite a while until a sweat finally relieved our tension whereupon
hugging Eumolpus around the knees Take pity upon the perishing I
besought him in the name of our common learning aid us  Death himself
hangs over us and he will come as a relief unless you help us
Overwhelmed by this implication Eumolpus swore by all the gods and
goddesses that he knew nothing of what had happened nor had he had any
ulterior purpose in mind but that he had brought his companions upon
this voyage which he himself had long intended taking with the most
upright intentions and in the best of good faith  But demanded he
what is this ambush  Who is this Hannibal who sails with us  Lycas of
Tarentum is a most respectable citizen and the owner not only of this
ship which he commands in person but of landed estates as well as
commercial houses under the management of slaves  He carries a cargo
consigned to market  He is the Cyclops the arch-pirate to whom we owe
our passage  And then besides himself there is Tryphaena a most
charming woman travelling about here and there in search of pleasure
But objected Giton they are the very ones we are most anxious to
avoid whereupon he explained to the astonished Eumolpus the reasons for
their enmity and for the danger which threatened us  So muddled did he
become at what had been told him that he lost the power of thinking
and requested each of us to offer his own opinion  Just imagine said
he that we are trapped in the Cyclopscave some way out must be
found unless we bring about a shipwreck and free ourselves from all
dangers  Bribe the pilot if necessary and persuade him to steer the
ship into some port volunteered Giton tell him your brother's nearly
dead from seasickness your woebegone face and streaming tears will lend
color to your deception and the pilot may be moved to mercy and grant
your prayer  Eumolpus denied the practicability of this  It is only
with difficulty affirmed he that large ships are warped into
landlocked harbors nor would it appear probable that my brother could
have been taken so desperately in so short a time  And then Lycas will
be sure to want to visit a sick passenger as part of his duties  You
can see for yourselves what a fine stroke it would be bringing the
captain to his own runaways  But supposing that the ship could be put
off her course supposing that Lycas did not hold sick-call how could we
leave the ship in such a manner as not to be stared at by all the rest
With muffled heads  With bare  If muffled who would not want to lend
the sick man a hand  If bare what would it mean if not proscribing
ourselves




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND SECOND

Why would it not be better to take refuge in boldness I asked slide
down a rope into the ship's boat cut the painter and leave the rest to
luck'  And furthermore I would not involve Eumolpus in this adventure
for what is the good of getting an innocent man into troubles with which
he has no concern  I shall be well content if chance helps us into the
boat  Not a bad scheme Eumolpus agreed if it could only be carried
out but who could help seeing you when you start  Especially the man at
the helm who stands watch all night long and observes even the motions
of the stars  But it could be done in spite of that when he dozed off
for a second that is if you chose some other part of the ship from
which to start as it is it must be the stern you must even slip down
the rudder itself for that is where the painter that holds the boat in
tow is made fast  And there is still something else Encolpius  I am
surprised that it has not occurred to you that one sailor is on watch
lying in the boat night and day  You couldn't get rid of that watchman
except by cutting his throat or throwing him overboard by force  Consult
your own courage as to whether that can be done or not  And as far as my
coming with you is concerned I shirk no danger which holds out any hopes
of success but to throw away life without a reason as if it were a
thing of no moment is something which I do not believe that even you
would sanction see what you think of this I will wrap you up in two
hide baggage covers tie you up with thongs and stow you among my
clothing as baggage leaving the ends somewhat open of course so you
can breathe and get your food Then I will raise a hue and cry because my
slaves have thrown themselves into the sea fearing worse punishment and
when the ship makes port I will carry you out as baggage without
exciting the slightest suspicion Oh  So you would bundle us up like
we were solid I sneered our bellies wouldn't make trouble for us of
course and we'll never sneeze nor snore  And all because a similar
trick turned out successfully before  Think the matter over  Being tied
up could be endured for one day but suppose it might have to be for
longer  What if we should be becalmed  What if we were struck by a
storm from the wrong quarter of the heavens  What could we  do then
Even clothes will cut through at the wrinkles when they are tied up too
long and paper in bundles will lose its shape  Do you imagine that we
who are young and unused to hardship could endure the filthy rags and
lashings necessary to such an operation as statues do  No  That's
settled  Some other road to safety must be found  I have thought up a
scheme see what you think of it  Eumolpus is a man of letters  He will
have ink about him of course  With this remedy then let's change our
complexions from hair to toe-nails  Then in the guise of Ethiopian
slaves we shall be ready at hand to wait upon you light-hearted as
having escaped the torturer and with our altered complexions we can
impose upon our enemies Yes indeed  sneered  Giton and be sure
and circumcise us too so we will be taken for Jews pierce our ears so
we will look like Arabs chalk our faces so that Gaul will take us for
her own sons as if color alone could change one's figure  As if many
other details did not require consideration if a passable imposture is to
result  Even granting that the stained face can keep its color for some
time suppose that not a drop of water should spot the skin suppose that
the garment did not stick to the ink as it often does where no gum is
used tell me  We can't make our lips so hideously thick can we  We
can't kink our hair with a curling-iron can we  We can't harrow our
foreheads with scars can we  We can't force our legs out into the form
of a bow or walk with our ankle-bones on the ground can we  Can we trim
our beards after the foreign style  No  Artificial color dirties the
body without changing it  Listen to the plan which I have thought out in
my desperation let's tie our garments around our heads and throw
ourselves into the deep




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRD

Gods and men forbid that you should make so base an ending of your
lives cried Eumolpus  No It will be better to do as I direct  As
you may gather from his razor my servant is a barber let him shave
your heads and eyebrows too and quickly at that  I will follow after
him and I will mark my inscription so cleverly upon your foreheads that
you will be mistaken for slaves who have been branded  The same letters
will serve both to quiet the suspicions of the curious and to conceal
under semblance of punishment your real features  We did not delay the
execution of this scheme but sneaking stealthily to the ship's side we
submitted our heads and eyebrows to the barber that he might shave them
clean  Eumolpus covered our foreheads completely with large letters
and with a liberal hand spread the universally known mark of the
fugitive over the face of each of us  As luck would have it one of the
passengers who was terribly seasick was hanging over the ship's side
easing his stomach  He saw the barber busy at his unseasonable task by
the light of the moon and cursing the omen which resembled the last
offering of a crew before shipwreck he threw himself into his bunk
Pretending not to hear his puking curses we reverted to our melancholy
train of thought and settling ourselves down in silence we passed the
remaining hours of the night in fitful slumber  On the following
morning Eumolpus entered Lycascabin as soon as he knew that Tryphaena
was out of bed and after some conversation upon the happy voyage of
which the fine weather gave promise Lycas turned to Tryphaena and
remarked




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTH

Priapus appeared to me in a dream and seemed to say Know that
Encolpius whom you seek has by me been led aboard your ship
Tryphaena trembled violently You would think we had slept together
she cried for a bust of Neptune which I saw in the gallery at Baiae
said to me in my dream You will find Giton aboard Lycasship  From
which you can see that Epicurus was a man inspired remarked Eumolpus
he passed sentence upon mocking phantasms of that kind in a very witty
manner

Dreams that delude the mind with flitting shades
By neither powers of air nor gods are sent
Each makes his own  And when relaxed in sleep
The members lie the mind without restraint
Can flit and re-enact by night the deeds
That occupied the day  The warrior fierce
Who cities shakes and towns destroys by fire
Maneuvering armies sees and javelins
And funerals of kings and bloody fields

The cringing lawyer dreams of courts and trials
The miser hides his hoard new treasures finds
The hunter's horn and hounds the forests wake
The shipwrecked sailor from his hulk is swept
Or washed aboard just misses perishing
Adultresses will bribe and harlots write
To lovers dogs in dreams their hare still course
And old wounds ache most poignantly in dreams

Still what's to prevent our searching the ship said Lycas after he
had expiated Tryphaena's dream so that we will not be guilty of
neglecting the revelations of Providence  And who were the rascals who
were being shaved last night by the light of the moon  chimed in Hesus
unexpectedly for that was the name of the fellow who had caught us at
our furtive transformation in the night  A rotten thing to do I swear
From what I hear it's unlawful for any living man aboard ship to shed
hair or nails unless the wind has kicked up a heavy sea




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTH

Lycas was greatly disturbed by this information and flew into a rage
So someone aboard my ship cut off his hair did he  he bawled and at
dead of night too  Bring the offenders aft on deck here and step
lively so that I can tell whom to punish from their heads that the
ship may be freed from the curse  I ordered it done Eumolpus broke
in and I didn't order it as an unlucky omen either seeing that I had
to be aboard the same vessel I did it because the scoundrels had long
matted hair I ordered the filth cleared off the wretches because I did
not wish to even seem to make a prison out of your ship besides I did
not want the seared scars of the letters to be hidden in the least by
the interference of the hair as they ought to be in plain sight for
everyone to read and at full length too  In addition to their other
misdemeanors they blew in my money on a street-walker whom they kept in
common only last night I dragged them away from her reeking with wine
and perfumes as they were and they still stink of the remnants of my
patrimony  Thereupon forty stripes were ordered for each of us that
the tutelary genius of the ship might be propitiated  And they were not
long about it either  Eager to propitiate the tutelary genius with our
wretched blood the savage sailors rushed upon us with their rope's ends
For my part I endured three lashes with Spartan fortitude but at the
very first blow Giton set up such a howling that his all too familiar
voice reached the ears of Tryphaena nor was she the only one who was in
a flutter for attracted by this familiar voice all the maids rushed to
where he was being flogged  Giton had already moderated the ardor of the
sailors by his wonderful beauty he appealed to his torturers without
uttering a word  It's Giton  It's Giton the maids all screamed in
unison  Hold your hands you brutes help Madame it's Giton
Tryphaena turned willing ears she had recognized that voice herself and
flew to the boy  Lycas who knew me as well as if he had heard my voice
now ran up he glanced at neither face nor hands but directed his eyes
towards parts lower down courteously he shook hands with them How do
you do Encolpius he said  Let no one be surprised at Ulyssesnurse
discovering after twenty years the scar that established his identity
since this man so keenly observant had in spite of the most skillful
disguise of every feature and the obliteration of every identifying mark
upon my body so surely hit upon the sole means of identifying his
fugitive  Deceived by our appearance Tryphaena wept bitterly
believing that the marks upon our foreheads were in truth the brands
of prisoners she asked us gently into what slave's prison we had fallen
in our wanderings and whose cruel hands had inflicted this punishment
Still fugitives whose members had gotten them into trouble certainly
deserved some punishment




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTH

In a towering passion Lycas leaped forward Oh you silly woman he
shouted as if those scars were made by the letters on the
branding-iron  If only they had really blotched up their foreheads with
those inscriptions it would be some satisfaction to us at least but
as it is we are being imposed upon by an actor's tricks and hoaxed by
a fake inscription  Tryphaena was disposed to mercy as all was not
lost for her pleasures but Lycas remembered the seduction of his wife
and the insults to which he had been subjected in the portico of the
temple of Hercules Tryphaena he gritted out his face convulsed with
savage passion you are aware I believe that the immortal gods have a
hand in human affairs what did they do but lead these scoundrels aboard
this ship in ignorance of the owner and then warn each of us alike by a
coincidence of dreams of what they had done  Can you then see how it
would be possible to let off those whom a god has himself delivered up
to punishment  I am not a cruel man what moves me is this I am afraid
I shall have to endure myself whatever I remit to them  At this
superstitious plea Tryphaena veered around  denying that she would
plead for quarter she was even anxious to help along the fulfillment of
this retribution so entirely just she had herself suffered an insult
no less poignant than had Lycas for her chastity had been called in
question before a crowd

Primeval Fear created Gods on earth when from the sky
The lightning-flashes rent with flame the ramparts of the world
And smitten Athos blazed  Then Phoebus sinking to the earth
His course complete and waning Luna offerings received
The changing seasons of the year the superstition spread
Throughout the world and Ignorance and Awe the toiling boor
To Ceres from his harvest the first fruits compelled to yield
And Bacchus with the fruitful vine to crown  Then Pales came
Into her own the shepherd's gains to share  Beneath the waves
Of every sea swims Neptune  Pallas guards the shops
And those impelled by Avarice or Guilt create new Gods

Lycas as he perceived that Tryphaena was as eager as himself for
revenge gave orders for our punishment to be renewed and made more
drastic whereupon Eumolpus endeavored to appease him as follows




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTH

Lycas said he these unfortunates upon whom you intend to wreak your
vengeance implore your compassion and have chosen me for this task
I believe that I am a man by no means unknown and they desire that
somehow I will effect a reconciliation between them and their former
friends  Surely you do not imagine that these young men fell into such
a snare by accident when the very first thing that concerns every
prospective passenger is the name of the captain to whom he intrusts his
safety  Be reasonable then forego your revenge and permit free men to
proceed to their destination without injury  When penitence manages to
lead their fugitives back harsh and implacable masters restrain their
cruelty and we are merciful to enemies who have surrendered  What could
you ask or wish for more  These well-born and respectable young men
be suppliant before your eyes and what ought to move you more strongly
still were once bound to you by the ties of friendship  If they had
embezzled your money or repaid your faith in them with treachery
by Hercules you have ample satisfaction from the punishment already
inflicted  Look  Can you read slavery on their foreheads and see upon
the faces of free men the brand-marks of a punishment which was
self-inflicted  Lycas broke in upon this plea for mercy Don't try to
confuse the issue he said let every detail have its proper attention
and first of all why did they strip all the hair off their heads
if they came of their own free will  A man meditates deceit not
satisfaction when he changes his features  Then again if they sought
reconciliation through a mediator why did you do your best to conceal
them while employed in their behalf  It is easily seen that the
scoundrels fell into the toils by chance and that you are seeking some
device by which you could sidestep the effects of our resentment  And be
careful that you do not spoil your case by over-confidence when you
attempt to sow prejudice among us by calling them well-born and
respectable  What should the injured parties do when the guilty run into
their own punishment  And inasmuch as they were our friends by that
they deserve more drastic punishment still for whoever commits an
assault upon a stranger is termed a robber but whoever assaults a
friend is little better than a parricide  I am well aware Eumolpus
replied to rebut this damning harangue that nothing can look blacker
against these poor young men than their cutting off their hair at night
On this evidence they would seem to have come aboard by accident not
voluntarily  Oh how I wish that the explanation could come to your ears
just as candidly as the thing itself happened  They wanted to relieve
their heads of that annoying and useless weight before they came aboard
but the unexpected springing up of the wind prevented the carrying out of
their wishes and they did not imagine that it mattered where they began
what they had decided to do because they were unacquainted with either
the omens or the law of seafaring men  But why should they shave
themselves like suppliants  demanded Lycas unless of course they
expected to arouse more sympathy as bald-pates  What's the use of
seeking information through a third person anyway  You scoundrel what
have you to say for yourself  What salamander singed off your eyebrows
You poisoner what god did you vow your hair to  Answer




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTH

I was stricken dumb and trembled from fear of punishment nor could I
find anything to say out of countenance as I was and hideous for to the
disgrace of a shaven poll was added an equal baldness in the matter of
eyebrows the case against me was only too plain there was not a thing
to be said or done  Finally a damp sponge was passed over my tear-wet
face and thereupon the smut dissolved and spread over my whole
countenance blotting out every feature in a sooty cloud  Anger turned
into loathing  Swearing that he would permit no one to humiliate
well-born young men contrary to right and law Eumolpus checked the
threats of the savage persecutors by word and by deed  His hired
servant backed him up in his protest as did first one and then another
of the feeblest of the seasick passengers whose participation served
rather to inflame the disagreement than to be of help to us  For myself
I asked no quarter but I shook my fists in Tryphaena's face and told
her in a loud voice that unless she stopped hurting Giton I would use
every ounce of my strength against her reprobate woman that she was
the only person aboard the ship who deserved a flogging  Lycas was
furiously angry at my hardihood nor was he less enraged at my
abandoning my own cause to take up that of another in so wholehearted
a manner  Inflamed as she was by this affront Tryphaena was as furious
as he so the whole ship's company was divided into two factions  On
our side the hired barber armed himself with a razor and served out the
others to us on their side Tryphaena's retainers prepared to battle
with their bare fists nor was the scolding of female warriors unheard
in the battle-line  The pilot was neutral but he declared that unless
this madness stirred up by the lechery of a couple of vagabonds died
down he would let go the helm The fury of the combatants continued to
rage none the less fiercely nevertheless they fighting for revenge we
for life  Many fell on each side though none were mortally wounded
and more bleeding from wounds retreated as from a real battle but
the fury of neither side abated At last the gallant Giton turned the
menacing razor against his own virile parts and threatened to cut away
the cause of so many misfortunes  This was too much for Tryphaena she
prevented the perpetration of so horrid a crime by the out and out
promise of quarter Time and time again I lifted the barber's blade to
my throat but I had no more intention of killing myself than had Giton
of doing what he threatened but he acted out the tragic part more
realistically than I as it was because he knew that he held in his
hand the same razor with which he had already cut his throat  The lines
still stood at the ready and it was plain to be seen that this would be
no everyday affair when the pilot with difficulty prevailed upon
Tryphaena to undertake the office of herald and propose a truce so
when pledges of good faith had been given and received in keeping with
the ancient precedent she snatched an olive-branch from the ship's
figurehead and holding it out advanced boldly to parley

What fury she exclaims turns peace to war  What evil deed
Was by these hands committed  Trojan hero there is none
Absconding in this ship with bride of Atreuscuckold seed
Nor crazed Medea stained by life's blood of her father's son
But passion scorned becomes a power alas who courts his end
By drawing sword amidst these waves  Why die before our time
Strive not with angry seas to vie and to their fury lend
Your rage by piling waves upon its savage floods sublime 




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND NINTH

The woman poured out this rhapsody in a loud excited voice the
battle-line wavered for an instant then all hands were recalled to
peace and terminated the war  Eumolpus our commander took advantage
of the psychological moment of their repentance and after administering
a stinging rebuke to Lycas signed a treaty of peace which was drawn up
as follows It is hereby solemnly agreed on your part Tryphaena that
you do forego complaint of any wrong done you by Giton that you do not
bring up anything that has taken place prior to this date that you do
not seek to revenge anything that has taken place prior to this date
that you do not take steps to follow it up in any other manner
whatsoever that you do not command the boy to perform anything to him
repugnant that you do neither embrace nor kiss the said Giton that you
do not enfold said Giton in the sexual embrace except under immediate
forfeiture of one hundred denarii  Item it is hereby agreed on your
part Lycas that you do refrain from annoying Encolpius with abusive
word or reproachful look that you do not seek to ascertain where he
sleep at night or if you do so seek that you forfeit two hundred
denarii immediately for each and every such offense  The treaty was
signed upon these terms and we laid down our arms  It seemed well to
wipe out the past with kisses after we had taken oath for fear any
vestige of rancor should persist in our minds  Factious hatreds died
out amidst universal good-fellowship and a banquet served on the field
of battle crowned our reconciliation with joviality  The whole ship
resounded with song and as a sudden calm had caused her to lose
headway one tried to harpoon the leaping fish another hauled in the
struggling catch on baited hooks  Then some sea-birds alighted upon the
yard-arms and a skillful fowler touched them with his jointed rods they
were brought down to our hands stuck fast to the limed segments  The
breeze caught up the down but the wing and tail feathers twisted
spirally as they fell into the sea-foam  Lycas was already beginning to
be on good terms with me and Tryphaena had just sprinkled Giton with
the last drops in her cup when Eumolpus who was himself almost drunk
was seized with the notion of satirizing bald pates and branded rascals
but when he had exhausted his chilly wit he returned at last to his
poetry and recited this little elegy upon hair

Gone are those locks that to thy beauty lent such lustrous charm
And blighted are the locks of Spring by bitter Winter's sway
Thy naked temples now in baldness mourn their vanished form
And glistens now that poor bare crown its hair all worn away
Oh  Faithless inconsistency  The gods must first resume
The charms that first they granted youth that it might lovelier
bloom
Poor wretch but late thy locks did brighter glister
Than those of great Apollo or his sister
Now smoother is thy crown than polished grasses
Or rounded mushrooms when a shower passes
In fear thou fliest the laughter-loving lasses
That thou may'st know that Death is on his way
Know that thy head is partly dead this day




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TENTH

It is my opinion that he intended favoring us with more of the same kind
of stuff sillier than the last but Tryphaena's maid led Giton away
below and fitted the lad out in her mistressfalse curls then producing
some eyebrows from a vanity box she skillfully traced out the lines of
the lost features and restored him to his proper comeliness  Recognizing
the real Giton Tryphaena was moved to tears and then for the first time
she gave the boy a real love-kiss  I was overjoyed now that the lad was
restored to his own handsome self but I hid my own face all the more
assiduously realizing that I was disfigured by no ordinary hideousness
since not even Lycas would bestow a word upon me  The maid rescued me
from this misfortune finally however and calling me aside she decked
me out with a head of hair which was none the less becoming my face
shone more radiantly still as a matter of fact for my curls were
golden  But in a little while Eumolpus mouthpiece of the distressed
and author of the present good understanding fearing that the general
good humor might flag for lack of amusement began to indulge in sneers
at the fickleness of women how easily they fell in love how readily
they forgot even their own sons  No woman could be so chaste but that
she could be roused to madness by a chance passion  Nor had he need to
quote from old tragedies or to have recourse to names notorious for
centuries on the contrary if we cared to hear it he would relate an
incident which had occurred within his own memory whereupon as we all
turned our faces towards him and gave him our attention he began as
follows




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVENTH

There was a certain married lady at Ephesus once upon a time so noted
for her chastity that she even drew women from the neighboring states to
come to gaze upon her  When she carried out her husband she was by no
means content to comply with the conventional custom and follow the
funeral cortege with her hair down beating her naked breast in sight of
the onlookers  She followed the corpse even into the tomb and when the
body had been placed in the vault in accordance with the Greek custom
she began to stand vigil over it weeping day and night  Neither parents
nor relations could divert her from punishing herself in this manner and
from bringing on death by starvation  The magistrates the last resort
were rebuffed and went away and the lady mourned by all as an unusual
example dragged through the fifth day without nourishment  A most
faithful maid was in attendance upon the poor woman she either wept in
company with the afflicted one or replenished the lamp which was placed
in the vault as the occasion required  Throughout the whole city there
was but one opinion men of every calling agreed that here shone the one
solitary example of chastity and of love  In the meantime the governor
of the province had ordered some robbers crucified near the little vault
in which the lady was bewailing her recent loss  On the following night
a soldier who was standing guard over the crosses for fear someone might
drag down one of the bodies for burial saw a light shining brightly
among the tombs and heard the sobs of someone grieving  A weakness
common to mankind made him curious to know who was there and what was
going on so he descended into the tomb and catching sight of a most
beautiful woman he stood still afraid at first that it was some
apparition or spirit from the infernal regions but he finally
comprehended the true state of affairs as his eye took in the corpse
lying there and as he noted the tears and the face lacerated by the
finger-nails he understood that the lady was unable to endure the loss
of the dear departed  He then brought his own scanty ration into the
vault and exhorted the sobbing mourner not to persevere in useless grief
or rend her bosom with unavailing sobs the same end awaited us all the
same last resting place and other platitudes by which anguished minds
are recalled to sanity  But oblivious to sympathy she beat and
lacerated her bosom more vehemently than before and tearing out her
hair she strewed it upon the breast of the corpse  Notwithstanding
this the soldier would not leave off but persisted in exhorting the
unfortunate lady to eat until the maid seduced by the smell of the
wine I suppose was herself overcome and stretched out her hand to
receive the bounty of their host  Refreshed by food and drink she
then began to attack the obstinacy of her mistress What good will it
do you to die of hungershe askedor to bury yourself alive'  Or to
surrender an uncondemned spirit before the fates demand it Think you
the ashes or sepultured dead can feel aught of thy woe  Would you recall
the dead from the reluctant fates  Why not shake off this womanish
weakness and enjoy the blessings of light while you can  The very corpse
lying there ought to convince you that your duty is to live When
pressed to eat or to live no one listens unwillingly and the lady
thirsty after an abstinence of several days finally permitted her
obstinacy to be overcome nor did she take her fill of nourishment
with less avidity than had the maid who had surrendered first




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWELFTH

But to make a long story short you know the temptations that beset a
full stomach the soldier laid siege to her virtue with the selfsame
blandishments by which he had persuaded her that she ought to live  Nor
to her modest eye did the young man seem uncouth or wanting in address
The maid pled in his behalf and kept repeating

Why will you fight with a passion that to you is pleasure
Remembering not in whose lands you are taking your leisure

But why should I keep you longer in suspense  The lady observed the
same abstinence when it came to this part of her body and the victorious
soldier won both of his objectives so they lay together not only
that night in which they pledged their vows but also the next and even
the third shutting the doors of the vault of course so that anyone
acquaintance or stranger coming to the tomb would be convinced that
this most virtuous of wives had expired upon the body of her husband  As
for the soldier so delighted was he with the beauty of his mistress and
the secrecy of the intrigue that he purchased all the delicacies his pay
permitted and smuggled them into the vault as soon as darkness fell
Meanwhile the parents of one of the crucified criminals observing the
laxness of the watch dragged the hanging corpse down at night and
performed the last rite  The soldier was hoodwinked while absent from
his post of duty and when on the following day he caught sight of one of
the crosses without its corpse he was in terror of punishment and
explained to the lady what had taken place He would await no sentence of
court-martial but would punish his neglect of duty with his own sword
Let her prepare a place for one about to die let that fatal vault serve
both the lover and the husband Not thatcried out the lady no less
merciful than chastethe gods forbid that I should look at the same
time upon the corpses of the two men dearest to me I would rather hang
the dead than slay the livingSo saying she gave orders for the body
of her husband to be lifted out of the coffin and fastened upon the
vacant cross  The soldier availed himself of the expedient suggested by
this very ingenious lady and next day everyone wondered how a dead man
had found his way to the cross




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEENTH

The sailors received this tale with roars of laughter and Tryphaena
blushed not a little and laid her face amorously upon Giton's neck  But
Lycas did not laugh If that governor had been a just man said he
shaking his head angrily he would have ordered the husband's body taken
down and carried back into the vault and crucified the woman  No doubt
the memory of Hedyle haunted his mind and the looting of his ship in
that wanton excursion But the terms of the treaty permitted the
harboring of no old grudges and the joy which filled our hearts left no
room for anger  Tryphaena was lying in Giton's lap by this time
covering his bosom with kisses one minute and rearranging the curls upon
his shaven head the next  Uneasy and chagrined at this new league I
took neither food nor drink but looked askance at them both with grim
eyes  Every kiss was a wound to me every artful blandishment which the
wanton woman employed and I could not make up my mind as to whether I
was more angered at the boy for having supplanted me with my mistress or
at my mistress for debauching the boy both were hateful to my sight and
more galling than my late servitude  And to make the matter all the more
aggravating Tryphaena would not even greet me as an acquaintance whom
she had formerly received as a lover while Giton did not think me worthy
of a Here's-to-you in ordinary civility nor even speak to me in the
course of the common conversation I suppose he was afraid of reopening a
tender scar at the moment when a return to her good graces had commenced
to draw it together  Tears of vexation dropped upon my breast and the
groan I smothered in a sigh nearly wracked my soul

The vulture tearing at the liver's deep and vital parts
That wracks our breasts and rends our very heartstrings
Is not that bird the charming poet sings with all his arts
T'is jealousy or hate that human hearts stings

In spite of my ill-humor Lycas saw how well my golden curls became me
and becoming enamoured anew began winking his wanton eyes at me and
sought admission to my good graces upon a footing of pleasure nor did he
put on the arrogance of a master but spoke as a friend asking a favor
long and ardently he tried to gain his ends but all in vain till at
last meeting with a decisive repulse his passion turned to fury and he
tried to carry the place by storm but Tryphaena came in unexpectedly and
caught him in his wanton attempt whereupon he was greatly upset and
hastily adjusted his clothing and bolted out of the cabin  Tryphaena was
fired with lust at this sight What was Lycas up to  she demanded
What was he after in that ardent assault  She compelled me to explain
burned still more hotly at what she heard and recalling memories of our
past familiarities she desired me to renew our old amour but I was worn
out with so much venery and slighted her advances  She was burning up
with desire by this time and threw her arms around me in a frenzied
embrace hugging me so tightly that I uttered an involuntary cry of pain
One of her maids rushed in at this and thinking that I was attempting to
force from her mistress the very favor which I had refused her she
sprang at us and tore us apart  Thoroughly enraged at the disappointment
of her lecherous passion Tryphaena upbraided me violently and with many
threats she hurried out to find Lycas for the purpose of exasperating him
further against me and of joining forces with him to be revenged upon me
Now you must know that I had formerly held a very high place in this
waiting-maid's esteem while I was prosecuting my intrigue with her
mistress and for that reason she took it very hard when she surprised me
with Tryphaena and sobbed very bitterly I pressed her earnestly to tell
me the reason for her sobs {and after pretending to be reluctant she
broke out} You will think no more of her than of a common prostitute if
you have a drop of decent blood in your veins  You will not resort to
that female catamite if you are a man {This disturbed my mind but}
what exercised me most was the fear that Eumolpus would find out what
was going on and being a very sarcastic individual might revenge my
supposed injury in some poetic lampoon in which event his ardent zeal
would without doubt expose me to ridicule and I greatly dreaded that
But while I was debating with myself as to the best means of preventing
him from getting at the facts who should suddenly come in but the man
himself and he was not uninformed as to what had taken place for
Tryphaena had related all the particulars to Giton and had tried to
indemnify herself for my repulse at the expense of my little friend
Eumolpus was furiously angry because of all this and all the more so as
lascivious advances were in open violation of the treaty which had been
signed  The minute the old fellow laid eyes upon me he began bewailing
my lot and ordered me to tell him exactly what had happened  As he was
already well informed I told him frankly of Lycaslecherous attempt and
of Tryphaena's wanton assault  When he had heard all the facts
Eumolpus swore roundly that he would certainly avenge us as the Gods
were just and would not suffer so many villainies to go unpunished




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEENTH

We were still discussing this and other matters when the sea grew rough
and clouds gathering from every quarter obscured with darkness the
light of day  The panic-stricken sailors ran to their stations and took
in sail before the squall was upon them but the gale did not drive the
waves in any one direction and the helmsman lost his bearings and did not
know what course to steer At one moment the wind would set towards
Sicily but the next the North Wind prevailing on the Italian coast
would drive the unlucky vessel hither and yon and what was more
dangerous than all the rain-squalls a pall of such black density blotted
out the light that the helmsman could not even see as far forward as the
bow  At last as the savage fury of the sea grew more malignant the
trembling Lycas stretched out his hands to me imploringly  Save us from
destruction Encolpius he shouted restore that sacred robe and holy
rattle to the ship  Be merciful for heaven's sake just as you used to
be  He was still shouting when a windsquall swept him into the sea the
raging elements whirled him around and around in a terrible maelstrom and
sucked him down  Tryphaena on the other hand was seized by her
faithful servants placed in a skiff along with the greater part of her
belongings and saved from certain death  Embracing Giton I wept aloud
Did we deserve this from the gods I cried to be united only in
death  No Malignant fortune grudges even that  Look  In an instant
the waves will capsize the ship  Think  In an instant the sea will
sever this lover's embrace  If you ever loved Encolpius truly kiss him
while yet you may and snatch this last delight from impending
dissolution  Even as I was speaking Giton removed his garment and
creeping beneath my tunic he stuck out his head to be kissed then
fearing some more spiteful wave might separate us as we clung together
he passed his belt around us both  If nothing else he cried the sea
will at least bear us longer joined together and if in pity it casts
us up upon the same shore some passerby may pile some stones over us
out of common human kindness or the last rites will be performed by the
drifting sand in spite of the angry waves  I submit to this last bond
and as though I were laid out upon my death-bed await an end no longer
dreaded Meanwhile accomplishing the decrees of the Fates the storm
stripped the ship of all that was left no mast no helm not a rope nor
an oar remained on board her she was only a derelict heavy and
water-logged drifting before the waves  Some fishermen hastily put off
in their little boats to salvage their booty but seeing men alive and
ready to defend their property they changed their predatory designs into
offers of help




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEENTH

Just then amid that clamor of voices we heard a peculiar noise and from
beneath the captain's cabin there came a bellowing as of some wild beast
trying to get out  We then followed up the sound and discovered
Eumolpus sitting there scribbling verses upon an immense sheet of
parchment  Astounded that he could find time to write poetry at death's
very door we hauled him out in spite of his protests and ordered him
to return to his senses but he flew into a rage at being interrupted
Leave me alone until I finish this sentence he bawled the poem
labors to its birth  Ordering Giton to come to close quarters and help
me drag the bellowing bard ashore I laid hands upon the lunatic  When
this job had at last been completed we came wet and wretched to a
fisherman's hut and refreshed ourselves somewhat with stores from the
wreck spoiled though they were by salt water and passed a night that
was almost interminable  As we were holding a council next day to
determine to what part of the country we had best proceed I suddenly
caught sight of a human body turning around in a gentle eddy and
floating towards the shore  Stricken with melancholy I stood still and
began to brood with wet eyes upon the treachery of the sea  And
perhaps said I a wife safe in some far-away country of the earth
awaits this man or a son who little dreams of storms or wrecks or
perhaps he left behind a father whom he kissed good-by at parting Such
is the end of mortal's plans such is the outcome of great ambitions
See how man rides the waves  Until now I had been sorrowing for a mere
stranger but a wave turned the face which had undergone no change
towards the shore and I recognized Lycas so evil-tempered and so
unrelenting but a short time before now cast up almost at my feet  I
could no longer restrain the tears at this I beat my breast again and
yet again with my hands  Where is your evil temper now  I cried
Where is your unbridled passion  You be there a prey to fish and wild
beasts you who boasted but a little while ago of the strength of your
command  Now you have not a single plank left of your great ship  Go
on mortals set your hearts upon the fulfillment of great ambitions Go
on schemers and in your wills control for a thousand years the disposal
of the wealth you got by fraud  Only yesterday this man audited the
accounts of his family estate yea even reckoned the day he would arrive
in his native land and settled it in his mind  Gods and goddesses how
far he lies from his appointed destination  But the waves of the sea are
not alone in thus keeping faith with mortal men The warrior's weapons
fail him the citizen is buried beneath the ruins of his own penates
when engaged in paying his vows to the gods another falls from his
chariot and dashes out his ardent spirit the glutton chokes at dinner
the niggard starves from abstinence  Give the dice a fair throw and you
will find shipwreck everywhere  Ah but one overwhelmed by the waves
obtains no burial  As though it matters in what manner the body once it
is dead is consumed by fire by flood by time  Do what you will
these all achieve the same end  Ah but the beasts will mangle the body
As though fire would deal with it any more gently when we are angry with
our slaves that is the punishment which we consider the most severe
What folly it is then to do everything we can to prevent the grave from
leaving any part of us behind {when the Fates will look out for us even
against our wills} After these reflections we made ready to pay the
last rites to the corpse and Lycas was burned upon a funeral pyre
raised by the hands of enemies while Eumolpus fixing his eyes upon the
far distance to gain inspiration composed an epitaph for the dead man

HIS FATE WAS UNAVOIDABLE

NO ROCK-HEWN TOMB NOR SCULPTURED MARBLE HIS

HIS NOBLE CORPSE FIVE FEET OF EARTH RECEIVED

HE RESTS IN PEACE BENEATH THIS HUMBLE MOUND




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEENTH

We set out upon our intended journey after this last office had been
wholeheartedly performed and in a little while arrived sweating at
the top of a mountain from which we made out at no great distance a
town perched upon the summit of a lofty eminence  Wanderers as we were
we had no idea what town it could be until we learned from a caretaker
that it was Crotona a very ancient city and once the first in Italy
When we earnestly inquired upon learning this what men inhabited such
historic ground and the nature of the business in which they were
principally engaged now that their wealth had been dissipated by the oft
recurring wars My friends replied he if you are men of business
change your plans and seek out some other conservative road to a
livelihood but if you can play the part of men of great culture always
ready with a lie you are on the straight road to riches The study of
literature is held in no estimation in that city eloquence has no niche
there economy and decent standards of morality come into no reward of
honor there you must know that every man whom you will meet in that city
belongs to one of two factions they eithertake-inor else they are
'taken-in No one brings up children in that city for the reason that
no one who has heirs is invited to dinner or admitted to the games such
an one is deprived of all enjoyments and must lurk with the rabble  On
the other hand those who have never married a wife or those who have no
near relatives attain to the very highest honors in other words they
are the only ones who are considered soldierly or the bravest of the
brave or even good  You will see a town which resembles the fields in
time of pestilence he continued in which there is nothing but
carcasses to be torn at and carrion crows tearing at them




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEENTH

Eumolpus who had a deeper insight turned this state of affairs over in
his mind and declared that he was not displeased with a prospect of that
kind  I thought the old fellow was joking in the care-free way of poets
until he complained If I could only put up a better front  I mean that
I wish my clothing was in better taste that my jewelry was more
expensive all this would lend color to my deception I would not carry
this scrip by Hercules I would not I would lead you all to great
riches  For my part I undertook to supply whatever my companion in
robbery had need of provided he would be satisfied with the garment and
with whatever spoils the villa of Lycurgus had yielded when we robbed it
as for money against present needs the Mother of the Gods would see to
that out of regard to her own good name  Well what's to prevent our
putting on an extravaganza demanded Eumolpus  Make me the master if
the business appeals to you No one ventured to condemn a scheme by
which he could lose nothing and so that the lie would be kept safe
among us all we swore a solemn oath the words of which were dictated by
Eumolpus to endure fire chains flogging death by the sword and
whatever else Eumolpus might demand of us just like regular gladiators
After the oath had been taken we paid our respects to our master with
pretended servility and were informed that Eumolpus had lost a son a
young man of great eloquence and promise and that it was for this reason
the poor old man had left his native land that he might not see the
companions and clients of his son nor even his tomb which was the cause
of his daily tears  To this misfortune a recent shipwreck had been
added in which he had lost upwards of two millions of sesterces not
that he minded the loss but destitute of a train of servants he could
not keep up his proper dignity  Furthermore he had invested in Africa
thirty millions of sesterces in estates and bonds such a horde of his
slaves was scattered over the fields of Numidia that he could have even
sacked Carthage  We demanded that Eumolpus cough frequently to further
this scheme that he have trouble with his stomach and find fault with
all the food when in company that he keep talking of gold and silver and
estates the incomes from which were not what they should be and of the
everlasting unproductiveness of the soil that he cast up his accounts
daily that he revise the terms of his will monthly and for fear any
detail should be lacking to make the farce complete he was to use the
wrong names whenever he wished to summon any of us so that it would be
plain to all that the master had in mind some who were not present  When
everything had been thus provided for we offered a prayer to the gods
that the matter might turn out well and happily and took to the road
But Giton could not bear up under his unaccustomed load and the hired
servant Corax a shirker of work often put down his own load and cursed
our haste swearing that he would either throw his packs away or run away
with his load  What do you take me for a beast of burden  he
grumbled or a scow for carrying stone I hired out to do the work of a
man not that of a pack-horse and I'm as free as you are even if my
father did leave me poor  Not satisfied with swearing he lifted up his
leg from time to time and filled the road with an obscene noise and a
filthy stench  Giton laughed at his impudence and imitated every
explosion with his lips {but Eumolpus relapsed into his usual vein even
in spite of this}




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH

Young men said he many are they who have been seduced by poetry
for the instant a man has composed a verse in feet and has woven a more
delicate meaning into it by means of circumlocutions he straightway
concludes that he has scaled Helicon Take those who are worn out by the
distressing detail of the legal profession for example they often seek
sanctuary in the tranquillity of poetry as a more sheltered haven
believing themselves able more easily to compose a poem than a rebuttal
charged with scintillating epigrams But a more highly cultivated mind
loves not this conceited affectation nor can it either conceive or bring
forth unless it has been steeped in the vast flood of literature  Every
word that is what I would calllowought to be avoided and phrases
far removed from plebeian usage should be chosen  LetYe rabble rout
avauntbe your rule  In addition care should be exercised in
preventing the epigrams from standing out from the body of the speech
they should gleam with the brilliancy woven into the fabric  Homer is an
example and the lyric poets and our Roman Virgil and the exquisite
propriety of Horace Either the others did not discover the road that
leads to poetry or having seen they feared to tread it  Whoever
attempts that mighty theme the civil war for instance will sink under
the load unless he is saturated with literature  Events past and
passing ought not to be merely recorded in verse the historian will
deal with them far better by means of circumlocutions and the
intervention of the immortals the free spirit wracked by the search for
epigrams having a mythological illusion should plunge headlong and
appear as the prophecy of a mind inspired rather than the attested faith
of scrupulous exactitude in speech  This hasty composition may please
you even though it has not yet received its final polishing




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH

The conquering Roman now held the whole world in his sway

The ocean the land where the sun shone by day or the moon

Gleamed by night but unsated was he  And the seas

Were roiled by the weight of his deep-laden keels if a bay

Lay hidden beyond or a land which might yield yellow gold

Twas held as a foe  While the struggle for treasure went on

The fates were preparing the horrors and scourges of war

Amusements enjoyed by the vulgar no longer can charm

Nor pleasures worn threadbare by use of the plebeian mob

The bronzes of Corinth are praised by the soldier at sea

And glittering gems sought in earth vie with purple of Tyre

Numidia curses her here there the exquisite silks

Of China Arabia's people have stripped their own fields

Behold other woes and calamities outraging peace

Wild beasts in the forest are hunted for gold and remote

African hammon is covered by beaters for fear

Some beast that slays men with his teeth shall escape for by that

His value to men is enhanced  The vessels receive

Strange ravening monsters the tiger behind gilded bars

And pacing his cage is transported to Rome that his jaws

May drip with the life blood of men to the plaudits of men

Oh shame  To point out our impending destruction the crime

Of Persia enacted anew in his puberty's bloom

The man child is kidnapped surrenders his powers to the knife

Is forced to the calling of Venus delayed and hedged round

The hurrying passage of life's finest years is held back

And Nature seeks Nature but finds herself not  Everywhere

These frail-limbed and mincing effeminates flowing of locks

Bedecked with an infinite number of garments of silk

Whose names ever change the wantons and lechers to snare

Are eagerly welcomed  From African soil now behold

The citron-wood tables their well-burnished surface reflects

Our Tyrian purples and slaves by the horde and whose spots

Resemble the gold that is cheaper than they and ensnare

Extravagance  Sterile and ignobly prized is the wood

But round it is gathered a company sodden with wine

And soldiers of fortune whose weapons have rusted devour

The spoils of the world  Art caters to appetite  Wrasse

From Sicily brought to their table alive in his own Sea water

The oysters from Lucrine's shore torn at the feast

Are served to make famous the host and the appetite cloyed

To tempt by extravagance  Phasis has now been despoiled

Of birds its littoral silent no sound there is heard

Save only the wind as it rustles among the last leaves

Corruption no less vile is seen in the campus of Mars

Our quirites are bribed and for plunder and promise of gain

Their votes they will alter  The people is venal corrupt

The Senate support has its price  And the freedom and worth

Of age is decayed scattered largesse now governs their power

Corrupted by gold even dignity lies in the dust

Cato defeated and hooted by mobs but the victor

Is sadder ashamed to have taken the rods from a Cato

In this lay the shame of the nation and character's downfall

Twas not the defeat of a man  No  The power and the glory

Of Rome were brought low represented in him was the honor

Of sturdy Republican Rome  So abandoned and wretched

The city has purchased dishonor has purchased herself

Despoiled by herself no avenger to wipe out the stigma

Twin maelstroms of debt and of usury suck down the commons

No home with clear title no citizen free from a mortgage

But as some slow wasting disease all unheralded fastens

Its hold on the vitals destroying the vigor of manhood

So fear of the evils impending impels them to madness

Despair turns to violence luxury's ravages needs must

Repaired be by bloodshed for indigence safely can venture

Can art or sane reason rouse wallowing Rome from the offal

And break the voluptuous slumber in which she is sunken

Or must it be fury and war and the blood-lust of daggers




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH

Three chieftains did fortune bring forth whom the fury of battles

Destroyed and interred each one under a mountain of weapons

The Parthian has Crassus Pompeius the Great by the waters

Of Egypt lies  Julius ungrateful Rome stained with his life blood

And earth has divided their ashes unable to suffer

The weight of so many tombs  These are the wages of glory

There lies between Naples and Great Puteoli a chasm

Deep cloven and Cocytus churns there his current the vapor

In fury escapes from the gorge with that lethal spray laden

No green in the aututun is there no grass gladdens the meadow

The supple twigs never resound with the twittering singing

Of birds in the Springtime  But chaos volcanic black boulders

Of pumice lie Happy within their drear setting of cypress

Amidst these infernal surroundings the ruler of Hades

Uplifted his head by the funeral flames silhouetted

And sprinkled with white from the ashes of corpses and challenged

Winged Fortune in words such as theseOh thou fickle controller

Of things upon earth and in heaven security's foeman

Oh Chance  Oh thou lover eternally faithful to change and

Possession's betrayer dost own thyself crushed by the power

Of Rome  Canst not raise up the tottering mass to its downfall

Its strength the young manhood of Rome now despises and staggers

In bearing the booty heaped up by its efforts behold how

They lavish their spoils  Wealth run mad now brings down their
destruction

They build out of gold and their palaces reach to the heavens

The sea is expelled by their moles and their pastures are oceans

They war against Nature in changing the state of creation

They threaten my kingdom  Earth yawns with their tunnels deep
driven

To furnish the stone for their madmen's foundations already

The mountains are hollowed and now but re-echoing caverns

While man quarries marble to serve his vainglorious purpose

The spirits infernal confess that they hope to win Heaven

Arise then O Chance change thy countenance peaceful to warlike

And harry the Romans consign to my kingdom the fallen

Ah long is it now since my lips were with blood cooled and
moistened

Nor has my Tisiphone bathed her blood-lusting body

Since Sulla's sword drank to repletion and earth's bristling harvest

Grew ripe upon blood and thrust up to the light of the sunshine'




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIRST

He spake   and attempted to clasp the right hand of Fortuna

But ruptured the crust of the earth deeply cloven asunder

Then from her capricious heart Fortune made answerO father

Whom Cocytusdeepest abysses obey if to forecast

The future I may without fear thy petition shall prosper

For no less consuming the anger that wars in this bosom

The flame no less poignant that burns to my marrow All favors

I gave to the bulwarks of Rome now I hate them My

Gifts I repent The same God who built up their dominion

Shall bring down destruction upon it In burning their manhood

My heart shall delight and its blood-lust shall slake with their
slaughter

Now Philippi's field I can see strewn with dead of two battles

And Thessaly's funeral pyres and Iberia mourning

Already the clangor of arms thrills my ears and rings loudly

Thou Lybian Nile I can see now thy barriers groaning

And Actium's gulf and Apollo's darts quailing the warriors

Then open thy thirsty dominions and summon fresh spirits

For scarce will the ferryman's strength be sufficient to carry

The souls of the dead in his skifftis a fleet that is needed

Thou Pallid Tisiphone slake with wide ruin thy thirsting

And tear ghastly wounds mangled earth sinks to hell and the
spirits'




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SECOND

But scarce had she finished when trembled the clouds and a
gleaming

Bright flash of Jove's lightning transfixed them with flame and was
gone

The Lord of the Shades blanched with fear at this bolt of his
brother's

Sank back and drew closely together the gorge in Earth's bosom

By auspices straightway the slaughter of men and the evils

Impending are shown by the gods   Here the Titan unsightly

Blood red veils his face with a twilight on strife fratricidal

Already he gazed thou hadst thought  There silvery Cynthia

Obscuring her face at the full denied light to the outrage

The mountain crests riven by rock-slides roll thundering downward

And wandering rivers to rivulets shrunk writhed no longer

Familiar marges between  With the clangor of armor

The heavens resound from the stars wafts the thrill of a trumpet

Sounding the call to arms  AEtna now roused to eruption

Unwonted darts flashes of flame to the clouds  Flitting phantoms

Appear midst the tombs and unburied bones gibbering menace

A comet strange stars in its diadem leads a procession

And reddens the skies with its fire  Showers of blood fall from
heaven

These portents the Deity shortly fulfilled  For now Caesar

Forsook vacillation and spurred by the love of revenge sheathed

The Gallic sword brandished the brand that proclaimed civil
warfare

There high in the Alps where the crags by a Greek god once
trodden

Slope down and permit of approach is a spot ever sacred

To Herculesaltar the winter with frozen snow seals it

And rears to the heavens a summit eternally hoary

As though the sky there had slipped down no warmth from the
sunbeams

No breath from the Springtime can soften the pile's wintry rigor

Nor slacken the frost chains that bind and its menacing shoulders

The weight of the world could sustain  With victorious legions

These crests Caesar trod and selected a camp  Gazing downwards

On Italy's plains rolling far from the top of the mountain

He lifted both hands to the heavens his voice rose in prayer

Omnipotent Jove and thou refuge of Saturn whose glory

Was brightened by feats of my armies and crowned with my triumphs

Bear witness  Unwillingly summon I Mars to these armies

Unwillingly draw I the sword  But injustice compels me

While enemy blood dyes the Rhine and the Alps are held firmly

Repulsing a second assault of the Gauls on our city

She dubs me an outcast  And Victory makes me an exile

To triumphs three score and defeats of the Germans my treason

I trace  How can they fear my glory or see in my battles

A menace  But hirelings and vile to whom my Rome is but a

Stepmother  Methinks that no craven this sword arm shall hamper

And take not a stroke in repost  On to victory comrades

While anger seethes hot  With the sword we will seek a decision

The doom lowering down is a peril to all and the treason

My gratitude owe I to you not alone have I conquered

Since punishment waits by our trophies and victory merits

Disgrace then let Chance cast the lots  Raise the standard of
battle

Again take your swords  Well I know  that my cause is accomplished

Amidst such armed warriors I know that I cannot be beaten'

While yet the words echoed from heaven the bird of Apollo

Vouchsafed a good omen and beat with his pinions the ether

From out of the left of a gloomy grove strange voices sounded

And flame flashed thereafter  The sun gleamed with brighter
refulgence

Unwonted his face in a halo of golden flame shining




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-THIRD

By omens emboldened to follow the battle-flags Caesar

Commanded and boldly led on down the perilous pathway

The footing firm-fettered by frost chains and ice did not hinder

At first but lay silent the kindly cold masking its grimness

But after the squadrons of cavalry shattered the clouds bound

By ice and the trembling steeds crushed in the mail of the rivers

Then melted the snows  And soon torrents newborn from the
heights of

The mountains rush down but these also as if by commandment

Grow rigid and turn into ice in their headlong rush downwards

Now that which rushed madly a moment before must be hacked
through

But now it was treacherous baffling their steps and their footing

Deceiving and men horses arms fall in heaps in confusion

And see  Now the clouds by an icy gale smitten their burden

Discharge  Lo the gusts of the whirlwind swirl fiercely
about them

The sky in convulsions with swollen hail buffets them sorely

Already the clouds themselves rupture and smother their weapons

An avalanche icy roars down like a billow of ocean

Earth lay overwhelmed by the drifts of the snow and the planets

Of heaven are blotted from sight overwhelmed are the rivers

That cling to their banks but unconquered is Caesar  His javelin

He leans on and scrunches with firm step a passage the bristling

Grim ice fields across  As spurred on by the lust of adventure

Amphitryon's offspring came striding the Caucasus slopes down

Or Jupiter's menacing mien as from lofty Olympus

He leaped the doomed giants to crush and to scatter their weapons

While Caesar in anger the swelling peaks treads down winged rumor

In terror flies forth and on beating wings seeks the high summit

Of Palatine tall every image she rocks with her message

Announcing this thunderbolt Roman  Already the ocean

Is tossing his fleets  Now his cavalry reeking with German

Gore pours from the Alps  Slaughter bloodshed and weapons

The red panorama of war is unrolled to their vision

By terror their hearts are divided two counsels perplex them

One chooses by land to seek flight to another the water

Appeals and the sea than his own land is safer  Another

Will stand to his arms and advantage extort from Fate's mandate

The depth of their fear marks the length of their flight  In
confusion

The people itself shameful spectacle driven by terror

Is led to abandon the city  Rome glories in fleeing

The Quirites from battle blench  Cowed by the breath of a rumor

Relinquished their firesides to mourning  One citizen palsied

With terror his children embraces another his penates

Conceals in his bosom then weeping takes leave of his threshold

And slaughters the distant invader with curses  Their spouses

Some clasp to their sorrow-wracked bosoms  Youths carry their
fathers

Bowed down with old age uninured to the bearing of burdens

They seize what they dread to lose most  Inexperience drags all

Its chattels to camp and to battle as when powerful Auster

Piles up the churned waters and tumbles them never a yard-arm

Nor rudder to answer the hand here one fashions a life-raft

Of pine planks another steers into some bay on a lee shore

Another will crack on and run from the gale and to Fortune

Trust all  But why sorrow for trifles  The consuls with Pompey

The Great he the terror of Pontus of savage Hydaspes

Explorer the reef that wrecked pirates caused Jove to turn livid

When thrice was a triumph decreed him whom Pontusvexed water

And pacified billows of Bosphorus worshipped  Disgraceful their

Flight  Title and glory forsaking  Now Fortune capricious

Looks down on the back of great Pompey retreating in terror




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOURTH

So great a misfortune disrupted the concord of heaven

And gods swelled the rout in their panic  Behold through creation

The gentle divinities flee from the ravening earth in

Their loathing they turn from humanity doomed to destruction

And first of all Peace with her snowy white arms hides her visage

Defeated her helmet beneath and abandoning earth flees

To seek out the realm of implacable Dis as a refuge

Meek Faith her companion and Justice with locks loosely flowing

And Concord in tears and her raiment in tatters attend her

The minions of Pluto pour forth from the portals of darkness

That yawn the serpent-haired Fury Bellona the Savage

Megoera with firebrands destruction and treachery livid

Death's likeness  Among them is Frenzy as free with her lashings

Snapped short she now raises her gory head shielding her features

Deep scarred by innumerous woundsneath her helmet blood-clotted

Her left arm she guards with a battle-scarred shield scored by
weapons

And numberless spear-heads protrude from its surface her right hand

A flaming torch brandishes kindling a flame that will burn up

The world  Now the gods are on earth and the skies note their
absence

The planets disordered their orbits attempt  Into factions

The heavens divide first Dione espouses the cause of

Her Caesar  Minerva next steps to her side and the great son

Of Ares his mighty spear brandishing  Phoebus espouses

The cause of Great Pompey his sister and Mercury also

And Hercules like unto him in his travels and labors

The trumpets call  Discord her Stygian head lifts to heaven

Her tresses disheveled her features with clotted blood covered

Tears pour from her bruised eyes her iron fangs thick coated
with rust

Her tongue distils poison her features are haloed with serpents

Her hideous bosom is visible under her tatters

A torch with a blood red flame waves from her tremulous right hand

Emerging from Cocytus dark and from Tartarus murky

She strode to the crests of the Apennines noble the prospect

Of earth to survey spread before her the world panorama

Its shores and the armies that march on its surface these words
then

Burst out of her bosom malignantTo arms now ye nations

While anger seethes hot seize your arms set the torch to the
cities

Who skulks now is lost neither woman nor child nor the aged

Bowed down with their years shall find quarter the whole world will
tremble

And rooftrees themselves shall crash down and take part in the
struggle

Marcellus hold firm for the law  And thou Curio madden

The rabble  Thou Lentulus strive not to check valiant Ares

Thou Cesar divine why delayest thou now thine invasion

Why smash not the gates why not level the walls of the cities

Their treasures to pillage  Thou Magnus dost not know the secret

Of holding the hills of Rome  Take thou the walls of Dyrrachium

Let Thessaly's harbors be dyed with the blood of the Romans'

On earth was obeyed every detail of Discord's commandment


When Eumolpus had with great volubility poured out this flood of words
we came at last to Crotona  Here we refreshed ourselves at a mean inn
but on the following day we went in search of more imposing lodgings and
fell in with a crowd of legacy hunters who were very curious as to the
class of society to which we belonged and as to whence we had come
Thereupon in accord with our mutual understanding such ready answers
did we make as to who we might be or whence we had come that we gave them
no cause for doubt  They immediately fell to wrangling in their desire
to heap their own riches upon Eumolpus and every fortune-hunter solicited
his favor with presents

VOLUME 5 AFFAIRS AT CROTONA



CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH

For a long time affairs at Crotona ran along in this manner and Eumolpus
flushed with success so far forgot the former state of his fortunes that
he even bragged to his followers that no one could hold out against any
wish of his and that any member of his suite who committed a crime
in that city would through the influence of his friends get off
unpunished  But although I daily crammed my bloated carcass to
overflowing with good things and began more and more to believe that
Fortune had turned away her face from keeping watch upon me I frequently
meditated nevertheless upon my present state and upon its cause
Suppose thought I some wily legacy hunter should dispatch an agent
to Africa and catch us in our lie  Or even suppose the hireling servant
glutted with prosperity should tip off his cronies or give the whole
scheme away out of spite  There would be nothing for it but flight and
in a fresh state of destitution a recalling of poverty which had been
driven off  Gods and goddesses how ill it fares with those living
outside the law they are always on the lookout for what is coming to
them  Turning these possibilities over in my mind I left the house in
a state of black melancholy hoping to revive my spirits in the fresh
air but scarcely had I set foot upon the public promenade when a girl
by no means homely met me and calling me Polyaenos the name I had
assumed since my metamorphosis informed me that her mistress desired
leave to speak with me  You must be mistaken I answered in
confusion I am only a servant and a stranger and am by no means worthy
of such an honor




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIXTH

You yourself she replied are the one to whom I was sent but
because you are well aware of your good looks you are proud and sell
your favors instead of giving them What else can those wavy well-combed
locks mean or that face rouged and covered with cosmetics or that
languishing wanton expression in your eyes  Why that gait so precise
that not a footstep deviates from its place unless you wish to show off
your figure in order to sell your favors  Look at me I know nothing
about omens and I don't study the heavens like the astrologers but I can
read men's intentions in their faces and I know what a flirt is after
when I see him out for a stroll so if you'll sell us what I want there's
a buyer ready but if you will do the graceful thing and lend let us be
under obligations to you for the favor  And as for your confession that
you are only a common servant by that you only fan the passion of the
lady who burns for you for some women will only kindle for canaille and
cannot work up an appetite unless they see some slave or runner with his
clothing girded up a gladiator arouses one or a mule-driver all covered
with dust or some actor posturing in some exhibition on the stage  My
mistress belongs to this class she jumps the fourteen rows from the
stage to the gallery and looks for a lover among the gallery gods at the
back Puffed up with this delightful chatter  Come now confess won't
you I queried is this lady who loves me yourself  The waiting maid
smiled broadly at this blunt speech  Don't have such a high opinion of
yourself said she I've never given in to any servant yet the gods
forbid that I should ever throw my arms around a gallows-bird  Let the
married women see to that and kiss the marks of the scourge if they like
I'll sit upon nothing below a knight even if I am only a servant  I
could not help marveling for my part at such discordant passions and I
thought it nothing short of a miracle that this servant should possess
the hauteur of the mistress and the mistress the low tastes of the wench

Each one will find what suits his taste one thing is not for all
One gathers roses as his share another thorns enthrall

After a little more teasing I requested the maid to conduct her mistress
to a clump of plane trees  Pleased with this plan the girl picked up
the skirt of her garment and turned into a laurel grove that bordered the
path  After a short delay she brought her mistress from her hiding-place
and conducted her to my side a woman more perfect than any statue
There are no words with which to describe her form and anything I could
say would fall far short  Her hair naturally wavy flowed completely
over her shoulders her forehead was low and the roots of her hair were
brushed back from it her eyebrows running from the very springs of her
cheeks almost met at the boundary line between a pair of eyes brighter
than stars shining in a moonless night her nose was slightly aquiline
and her mouth was such an one as Praxiteles dreamed Diana had  Her chin
her neck her hands the gleaming whiteness of her feet under a slender
band of gold she turned Parian marble dull  Then for the first time
Doristried lover thought lightly of Doris

Oh Jove what's come to pass that thou thine armor cast away
Art mute in heaven and but an idle tale
At such a time the horns should sprout the raging bull hold sway
Or they white hair beneath swan's down conceal
Here's Dana's self  But touch that lovely form
Thy limbs will melt beneath thy passionsstorm




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVENTH

She was delighted and so be witchingly did she smile that I seemed to see
the full moon showing her face from behind a cloud  Then punctuating
her words with her fingers Dear boy if you are not too critical to
enjoy a woman of wealth who has but this year known her first man I
offer you a sister said she  You have a brother already I know for
I didn't disdain to ask but what is to prevent your adopting a sister
too  I will come in on the same footing only deem my kisses worthy of
recognition and caress me at your own pleasure  Rather let me implore
you by your beauty I replied  Do not scorn to admit an alien among
your worshipers If you permit me to kneel before your shrine you will
find me a true votary and that you may not think I approach this temple
of love without a gift I make you a present of my brother  What she
exclaimed would you really sacrifice the only one without whom you
could not live'  The one upon whose kisses your happiness depends  Him
whom you love as I would have you love me  Such sweetness permeated her
voice as she said this so entrancing was the sound upon the listening
air that you would have believed the Sirensharmonies were floating in
the breeze  I was struck with wonder and dazzled by I know not what
light that shone upon me brighter than the whole heaven but I made
bold to inquire the name of my divinity  Why didn't my maid tell you
that I am called Circe  she replied  But I am not the sun-child nor
has my mother ever stayed the revolving world in its course at her
pleasure but if the Fates bring us two together I will owe heaven a
favor  I don't know what it is but some god's silent purpose is beneath
this  Circe loves not Polyaenos without some reason a great torch is
always flaming when these names meet  Take me in your arms then if you
will there's no prying stranger to fear and yourbrotheris far away
from this spot  So saying Circe clasped me in arms that were softer
than down and drew me to the ground which was covered with colored
flowers

With flowers like these did Mother Earth great Ida's summit strew
When Jupiter his heart aflame enjoyed his lawful love
There glowed the rose the flowering rush the violet's deep blue
From out green meadows snow-white lilies laughed  Then from above
This setting summoned Venus to the green and tender sod
Bright day smiled kindly on the secret amour of the God

Side by side upon the grassy plot we lay exchanging a thousand kisses
the prelude to more poignant pleasure but alas  My sudden loss of
vigor disappointed Circe




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT

Infuriated at this affront What's the matter demanded she do my
kisses offend you  Is my breath fetid from fasting  Is there any evil
smelling perspiration in my armpits  Or if it's nothing of this kind
are you afraid of Giton Under her eyes I flushed hotly and if I had
any virility left I lost it then my whole body seemed to be inert  My
queen I cried do not mock me in my humiliation  I am bewitched
Circe's anger was far from being appeased by such a trivial excuse
turning her eyes contemptuously away from me she looked at her maid
Tell me Chrysis and tell me truly is there anything repulsive about
me  Anything sluttish  Have I some natural blemish that disfigures my
beauty  Don't deceive your mistress  I don't know what's the matter
with us but there must be something  Then she snatched a mirror from
the silent maid and after scrutinizing all the looks and smiles which
pass between lovers she shook out her wrinkled earth-stained robe and
flounced off into the temple of Venus nearby And here was I like a
convicted criminal who had seen some horrible nightmare asking myself
whether the pleasure out of which I had been cheated was a reality or
only a dream

As when in the sleep-bringing night
Dreams sport with the wandering eyes
And earth spaded up yields to light
Her gold that by day she denies
The stealthy hand snatches the spoils
The face with cold sweat is suffused
And Fear grips him tight in her toils
Lest robbers the secret have used
And shake out the gold from his breast
But when they depart from his brain
These enchantments by which he's obsessed
And Truth comes again with her train
Restoring perspective and pain
The phantasm lives to the last
The mind dwells with shades of the past

The misfortune seemed to me a dream but I imagined that I must surely
be under a spell of enchantment and for a long time I was so devoid of
strength that I could not get to my feet  But finally my mental
depression began to abate little by little my strength came back to me
and I returned home arrived there I feigned illness and threw myself
upon my couch  A little late Giton who had heard of my indisposition
entered the room in some concern  As I wished to relieve his mind I
informed him that I had merely sought my pallet to take a rest telling
him much other gossip but not a word about my mishap as I stood in great
fear of his jealousy and to lull any suspicion which he might entertain
I drew him to my side and endeavoured to give him some proofs of my love
but all my panting and sweating were in vain  He jumped up in a rage and
accused my lack of virility and change of heart declaring that he had
for a long time suspected that I had been expending my vigor and breath
elsewhere  No  No  Darling I replied my love for you has always
been the same but reason prevails now over love and wantonness And
for the Socratic continence of your love I thank you in his name he
replied sarcastically Alcibiades was never more spotless when he left
his master's bed




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINTH

Believe mebrotherwhen I tell you that I do not know whether I am a
man or not I vainly protested I do not feel like one if I am
Dead and buried lies that part in which I was once an Achilles  Giton
seeing that I was completely enervated and fearing that it might give
cause for scandal if he were caught in this quiet place with me tore
himself away and fled into an inner part of the house  He had just gone
when Chrysis entered the room and handed me her mistress's tablets in
which were written the following words

CIRCE TO POLYIENOS-GREETING

Were I a wanton I should complain of my disappointment but as it
is I am beholden to your impotence for by it I dallied the longer
in the shadow of pleasure  Still I would like to know how you are
and whether you got home upon your own legs for the doctors say
that one cannot walk without nerves  Young man I advise you to
beware of paralysis for I never in my life saw a patient in such
great danger you're as good as dead I'm sure  What if the same
numbness should attack your hands and knees  You would have to send
for the funeral trumpeters  Still even if I have been affronted
I will not begrudge a prescription to one as sick as you  Ask Giton
if you would like to recover  I am sure you will get back your
strength if you will sleep without your brother for three nights
So far as I am concerned I am not in the least alarmed about
finding someone to whom I shall be as pleasing as I was to you my
mirror and my reputation do not lie

Farewell if you can

Such things will happen said Chrysis when she saw that I had read
through the entire inditement and especially in this city where the
women can lure the moon from the sky  But we'll find a cure for your
trouble  Just return a diplomatic answer to my mistress and restore her
self-esteem by frank courtesy for truth to tell she has never been
herself from the minute she received that affront  I gladly followed
the maid's advice and wrote upon the tablets as follows




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTIETH

POLYAENOS TO CIRCE GREETING

Dear lady I confess that I have often given cause for offense for
I am only a man and a young one too but I never committed a
deadly crime until today  You have my confession of guilt I
deserve any punishment you may see fit to prescribe  I betrayed a
trust I murdered a man I violated a temple demand my punishment
for these crimes  Should it be your pleasure to slay me I will come
to you with my sword if you are content with a flogging I will run
naked to my mistress only bear in mind that it was not myself but
my tools that failed me  I was a soldier and ready but I had no
arms  What threw me into such disorder I do not know perhaps my
imagination outran my lagging body by aspiring to too much it is
likely that I spent my pleasure in delay I cannot imagine what the
trouble was  You bid me beware of paralysis as if a disease which
prevented my enjoying you could grow worse  But my apology amounts
briefly to this if you will grant me an opportunity of repairing my
fault I will give you satisfaction
	 Farewell

After dismissing Chrysis with these fair promises I paid careful
attention to my body which had so evilly served me and omitting the
bath I annointed myself in moderation with unguents and placed myself
upon a more strengthening diet such as onions and snail's heads without
condiments and I also drank more sparingly of wine then taking a short
walk before settling down to sleep I went to bed without Giton  So
anxious was I to please her that I feared the outcome if my brother lay
tickling my side




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIRST

Finding myself vigorous in mind and body when I arose next morning I
went down to the same clump of plane trees though I dreaded the spot as
one of evil omen and commenced to wait for Chrysis to lead me on my way
I took a short stroll and had just seated myself where I had sat the day
before when she came under the trees leading a little old woman by the
hand  Well Mr Squeamish she chirped when she had greeted me have
you recovered your appetite  In the meantime the old hag

A wine-soaked crone with twitching lips

brought out a twisted hank of different colored yarns and put it about my
neck she then kneaded dust and spittle and dipping her middle finger
into the mixture she crossed my forehead with it in spite of my
protests

As long as life remains there's hope
Thou rustic God oh hear our prayer
Great Priapus I thee invoke
Temper our arms to dare

When she had made an end of this incantation she ordered me to spit three
times and three times to drop stones into my bosom each stone she
wrapped up in purple after she had muttered charms over it then
directing her hands to my privates she commenced to try out my virility
Quicker than thought the nerves responded to the summons filling the
crone's hand with an enormous erection  Skipping for joy Look
Chrysis look she cried out see what a hare I've started for someone
else to course  This done the old lady handed me over to Chrysis who
was greatly delighted at the recovery of her mistress's treasure she
hastily conducted me straight to the latter introducing me into a lovely
nook that nature had furnished with everything which could delight the
eye

Shorn of its top the swaying pine here casts a
summer shade
And quivering cypress and the stately plane
And berry-laden laurel  A brook's wimpling waters strayed
Lashed into foam but dancing on again
And rolling pebbles in their chattering flow
Twas Love's own nook
As forest nightingale and urban Procne undertook
To bear true witness hovering the gleaming grass above
And tender violets wooing with song their stolen love

Fanning herself with a branch of flowering myrtle she lay stretched out
with her marble neck resting upon a golden cushion  When she caught
sight of me she blushed faintly she recalled yesterday's affront I
suppose  At her invitation I sat down by her side as soon as the
others had gone whereupon she put the branch of myrtle over my face and
emboldened as if a wall had been raised between us Well Mr
Paralytic she teased have you brought all of yourself along today
Why ask me I replied why not try me instead  and throwing myself
bodily into her arms I revelled in her kisses with no witchcraft to stop
me




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SECOND

The loveliness of her form drew me to her and summoned me to love  Our
lips were pressed together in a torrent of smacking kisses our groping
hands had discovered every trick of excitation and our bodies clasped
in a mutual embrace had fused our souls into one and then in the very
midst of these ravishing preliminaries my nerves again played me false
and I was unable to last until the instant of supreme bliss Lashed to
fury by these inexcusable affronts the lady at last ran to avenge
herself and calling her house servants she gave orders for me to be
hoisted upon their shoulders and flogged then still unsatisfied with
the drastic punishment she had inflicted upon me she called all the
spinning women and scrubbing wenches in the house and ordered them to
spit upon me  I covered my face with my hands but I uttered no complaint
as I well knew what I deserved and overwhelmed with blows and spittle I
was driven from the house Proselenos was kicked out too Chrysis was
beaten and all the slaves grumbled among themselves and wondered what
had upset their mistress's good humor  I took heart after having given
some thought to my misfortunes and artfully concealing the marks of the
blows for fear that Eumolpus would make merry over my mishaps or worse
yet that Giton might be saddened by my disgrace I did the only thing I
could do to save my self-respect I pretended that I was sick and went to
bed  There I turned the full fury of my resentment against that
recreant which had been the sole cause of all the evil accidents which
had befallen me

Three times I grasped the two-edged blade
The recreant to cut away
Three times by Fear my hand was stayed
And palsied Terror said me nay
That which I might have done before
Twas now impossible to do
For cold with Fear the wretch withdrew
Into a thousand-wrinkled mare
And shrank in shame before my gaze
Nor would his head uncover more
But though the scamp in terror skulked
With words I flayed him as he sulked

Raising myself upon my elbow I rebuked the shirker in some such terms as
these What have you to say for yourself you disgrace to gods and men
I demanded for your name must never be mentioned among refined people
Did I deserve to be lifted up to heaven and then dragged down to hell by
you  Was it right for you to slander my flourishing and vigorous years
and land me in the shadows and lassitude of decrepit old age  Give me
some sign however faint I beg of you that you have returned to life
I vented my anger in words such as these

His eyes were fixed and with averted look
He stood less moved by any word of mine
Than weeping willows bending o'er a brook
Or drooping poppies as at noon they pine

When I had made an end of this invective so out of keeping with good
taste I began to do penance for my soliloquy and blushed furtively
because I had so far forgotten my modesty as to invoke in words that part
of my body which men of dignity do not even recognize  Then rubbing my
forehead for a long time Why have I committed an indiscretion in
relieving my resentment by natural abuse I mused what does it amount
to  Are we not accustomed to swear at every member of the human body
the belly throat or even the head when it aches as it often does  Did
not Ulysses wrangle with his own heart  Do not the tragediansDamn
their eyesjust as if they could hear

Gouty patients swear at their feet rheumatics at their hands
blear-eyed
people at their eyes and do not those who often stub their toes blame
their feet for all their pain

Why will our Catos with their frowning brows
Condemn a work of fresh simplicity'
A cheerful kindness my pure speech endows
What people do I write to my capacity
For who knows not the pleasures Venus gives
Who will not in a warm bed tease his members
Great Epicurus taught a truth that lives
Love and enjoy life  All the rest is embers

Nothing can be more insincere than the silly prejudices of mankind and
nothing sillier than the morality of bigotry




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THIRD

I called Giton when I had finished my meditation Tell me little
brother I demanded tell me on your honor Did Ascyltos stay awake
until he had exacted his will of you the night he stole you away from
me  Or was he content to spend the night like a chaste widow  Wiping
his eyes the lad in carefully chosen words took oath that Ascyltos had
used no force against him  The truth of the matter is that I was so
distraught with my own misfortunes that I knew not what I was saying
Why recall past memories which can only cause pain said I to myself
I then directed all my energies towards the recovery of my lost manhood
To achieve this I was ready even to devote myself to the gods
accordingly I went out to invoke the aid of Priapus {Putting as good a
face upon the matter as I could} I knelt upon the threshold of his shrine
and invoked the God in the following verses

Of Bacchus and the nymphs companion boon
Whom fair Dione set o'er forests wide
As God whom Lesbos and green Thasos own
For deity whom Lydians far and wide
Adore through all the seasons of the year
Whose temple in his own Hypaepa placed
Thou Dryad's joy and Bacchushear my prayer
To thee I come by no dark blood disgraced
No shrine in wicked lust have I profaned
When I was poor and worn with want I sinned
Not by intent a pauper's sin's not banned
As of another  Unto thee I pray
Lift thou the load from off my tortured mind
Forgive a light offense  When fortune smiles
I'll not thy glory shun and leave behind
Thy worship  Unto thee a goat that feels
His primest vigor father of the flocks
Shall come  And suckling pigs the tender young
Of some fine grunting sow  New wine in crocks
Shall foam  Thy grateful praises shall be sung
By youths who thrice shall dance around thy shrine
Happy in youth and full of this year's wine

While I was engaged in this diplomatic effort in behalf of the affected
member a hideous crone with disheveled hair and clad in black garments
which were in great disorder entered the shrine and laying hands upon
me led me {thoroughly frightened} out into the portico




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOURTH

What witches she cried have devoured your manhood  What filth did
you tread upon at some crossroads in the dark  Not even by the boy
could you do your duty but weak and effeminate you are worn out like a
cart-horse at a hill you have lost both labor and sweat  Not content
with getting yourself into trouble you have stirred up the wrath of the
gods against me {and I will make you smart for it}  She then led me
unresisting back into the priestess's room pushed me down upon the bed
snatched a cane that hung upon the door and gave me another thrashing
I remained silent and had the cane not splintered at the first stroke
thereby diminishing the force of the blow she might easily have broken
my arms or my head  I groaned dismally and especially when she
manipulated my member and shedding a flood of tears I covered my head
with my right arm and huddled down upon the pillow  Nor did she weep
less bitterly

The sailor naked from his foundered barque
Some shipwrecked mariner seeks out to hear his woe
When hail beats down a farmer's crop his cark
Seeks consolation from another too
Death levels caste and sufferers unites
And weeping parents are as one in grief
We also will beseech the starry heights
United prayers climb best is the belief

She seated herself upon the other side of the bed and in quavering tones
commenced to accuse the delays of old age  At last the priestess came
in  Why she cried what has brought you into my cell as if you were
visiting a newly made grave  And on a feast-day too when even mourners
ought to smile  OEnothea the old hag replied this young man here
was born under an unlucky star he can't dispose of his goods to either
boy or girl  Such an unfortunate fellow you never saw  He has no tool
at all only a piece of leather soaked in water  I wish you would tell
me what you think of a man who could get up from Circe's bed without
having tasted pleasure  On hearing these words OEnothea sat down
between us and after shaking her head for a while I'm the only one
that knows how to cure that disease said she and for fear you think
I'm talking to hear myself talk I'll just have the young fellow sleep
with me for a night and if I don't make it as hard as horn

All that you see in the world must give heed to my mandates

Blossoming earth when I will it must languish a desert'

Riches pour forth when I will it from crags and grim boulders

Waters will spurt that will rival the Nile at its flooding

Seas calm their billows before me gales silence their howlings

Hearing my step  And the rivers sink into their channels

Dragons Hyrcanian tigers stand fast at my bidding

Why should I tell you of small things  The image of Luna

Drawn by my spells must descend and Apollo atremble

Backs up his horses and turns from his course at my order

Such is the power of my word  By the rites of a virgin

Quenched is the raging of bulls and the sun's daughter Circe

Changed and transfigured the crew of the wily Ulysses

Proteus changes his form when his good pleasure dictates

I who am skilled in these arts can the shrubs of Mount Ida

Plant in the ocean turn rivers to flow up the mountains




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIFTH

At this declaration which was so awe-inspiring I shuddered in terror
and commenced to scrutinize the crone more narrowly  Come now said
OEnothea obey my orders and carefully wiping her hands she bent
over the cot and kissed me once twice  On the middle of the altar
OEnothea placed an old table upon which she heaped live coals then with
melted pitch she repaired a goblet which had become cracked through age
Next she replaced in the smoke-stained wall a peg which had come out
when she took down the wooden goblet  Then having donned a mantle in
the shape of a piece of square-cut cloth she set a huge kettle upon the
hearth and at the same time speared with a fork a cloth hanging upon the
meathooks and lifted it down  It contained some beans which had been
laid away for future use and a very small and stale piece of pig's
cheek scored with a thousand slashes  When she had untied the string
which fastened the cloth she poured some of the beans upon the table and
ordered me to shell them quickly and carefully  I obey her mandate and
with careful fingers separate the beans from the filthy pods which
contain them but she accusing my clumsiness hastily snatched them and
skillfully tearing off the pods with her teeth spat them upon the
ground where they looked like dead flies  I wondered then at the
ingenuity of poverty and its expedients for emergency  So ardent a
follower of this virtue did the priestess seem that it was reflected in
everything around her  Her dwelling in particular was a very shrine of
poverty

No Indian ivory set in gold gleamed here
No trodden marble glistened here no earth
Mocked for its gifts but Ceresfestive grove
With willow wickerworktwas set around
New cups of clay by revolutions shaped
Of lowly wheel  For honey soft a bowl
Platters of green bark wickerwork a jar
Stained by the lifeblood of the God of Wine
The walls around with chaff and spattered clay
Were covered  Flanging from protruding nails
Were slender stalks of the green rush and then
Suspended from the smoky beam the stores
Of this poor cottage  Service berries soft
Entwined in fragrant wreaths hung down
Dried savory and raisins by the bunch
An hostess here like she on Attic soil
Of Hecate's pure worship worthy she
Whose fame Kallimachos so grandly sang
Twill live forever through the speaking years




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SIXTH

In the meantime having shelled the beans she took a mouthful of the
meat and with the fork was replacing the pig's cheek which was coeval
with herself upon the meat-hook when the rotten stool which she was
using to augment her height broke down under the old lady's weight and
let her fall upon the hearth  The neck of the pot was broken putting
out the fire which was just getting a good start her elbow was burned
by a flaming brand and her whole face was covered by the ashes raised by
her fall  I jumped up in dismay and not without laughing helped the
old lady to her feet  She hastily scurried out into the neighborhood to
replenish the fire for fear anything should delay the sacrifice  I was
on my way to the door of the cell when lo and behold three sacred geese
which were accustomed I suppose to demand their feed from the old woman
at midday made a rush at me and surrounding me made me nervous with
their abominable rabid cackling  One tore at my tunic another undid the
lacings of my sandals and tugged at them but one in particular the
ringleader and moving spirit of this savage attack did not hesitate to
worry at my leg with his serrated bill  Unable to see the joke I
twisted off one of the legs of the little table and thus armed began to
belabor the pugnacious brute  Nor did I rest content with a light blow
I avenged myself by the death of the goose

Twas thus I ween the birds of Stymphalus
To heaven fled by Herakles impelled
The Harpies too whose reeking pinions held
That poison which the feast of Phineus
Contaminated  All the air above
With their unwonted lamentations shook
The heavens in uproar and confusion move
{The Stars in dread their orbits then forsook}

By this time the two remaining geese had picked up the beans which had
been scattered all over the floor and bereft I suppose of their leader
had gone back into the temple and I well content with my revenge and my
booty threw the dead goose behind the cot and bathed the trifling wound
in my leg with vinegar then fearing a scolding I made up my mind to
run away and collecting together all my belongings started to leave the
house  I had not yet stepped over the threshold of the cell however
when I caught sight of OEnothea returning with an earthen vessel full of
live coals  Thereupon I retraced my steps and throwing off my garments
I took my stand just inside the door as if I were awaiting her return
She banked her fire with broken reeds piled some pieces of wood on top
and began to excuse her delay on the ground that her friend would not
permit her to leave until after the customary three drinks had been
taken  But what were you up to in my absence  she demanded  Where
are the beans  Thinking that I had done a thing worthy of all praise I
informed her of the battle in all its details and that she might not be
downcast any longer I produced the dead goose in payment for her loss
When the old lady laid eyes upon that she raised such a clamor that you
would have thought that the geese had invaded the room again  Confounded
and thunderstruck at the novelty of my crime I asked her why she was so
angry and why she pitied the goose rather than myself




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVENTH

But beating her palms together You villain are you so brazen that you
can speak  she shrieked  Don't you know what a serious crime you've
committed  You have slaughtered the delight of Priapus a goose the
very darling of married women  And for fear you think that nothing
serious has happened if the magistrates find this out you'll go to the
cross  Until this day my dwelling has been inviolate and you have
polluted it with blood  You have conducted yourself in such a manner
that any enemy I have can turn me out of the priesthood

She spoke and from her trembling head she tore the snow-white hair
And scratched her cheeks her eyes shed floods of tears
As when a torrent headlong rushes down the valleys drear
Its icy fetters gone when Sprint appears
And strikes the frozen shackles from rejuvenated earth
So down her face the tears in torrents swept
And wracking sobs convulsed her as she wept

Please don't make such a fuss I said I'll give you an ostrich in
place of your goose  While she sat upon the cot and to my
stupefaction bewailed the death of the goose Proselenos came in with
the materials for the sacrifice  Seeing the dead goose and inquiring the
cause of her grief she herself commenced to weep more violently still
and to commiserate me as if I had slain my own father instead of a
public goose  Growing tired of this nonsense at last See here
said I could I not purchase immunity for a price even though I had
assaulted you'  Even though I had murdered a man  Look here  I'm
laying down two gold pieces you can buy both gods and geese with them
Forgive me young man said OEnothea when she caught sight of the
gold I am anxious upon your account that is a proof of love not of
malignity  Let us take such precautions that not a soul will find this
out  As for you pray to the gods to forgive your sacrilege

The rich man can sail in a favoring gale
And snap out his course at his pleasure
A Dance espouse no Acrisius will rail
His credence by hers he will measure
Write verse or declaim snap the finger of scorn
At the world yet still win all his cases
The rabble will drink in his words with concern
When a Cato austere it displaces
At law his not proven or proved he can have
With Servius or Labeo vieing
With gold at command anything he may crave
Is his without asking or sighing
The universe bows at his slightest behest
For Jove is a prisoner in his treasure chest

In the meantime she scurried around and put a jar of wine under my hands
and when my fingers had all been spread out evenly she purified them
with leeks and parsley  Then muttering incantations she threw
hazel-nuts into the wine and drew her conclusions as they sank or
floated but she did not hoodwink me for those with empty shells no
kernel and full of air would of course float while those that were
heavy and full of sound kernel would sink to the bottom  {She then
turned her attention to the goose} and cutting open the breast she
drew out a very fat liver from which she foretold my future  Then for
fear any trace of the crime should remain she cut the whole goose up
stuck the pieces upon spits and served up a very delectable dinner for
me whom but a moment before she had herself condemned to death in
her own words  Meanwhile cups of unmixed wine went merrily around and
the crones greedily devoured the goose which they had but so lately
lamented  When the last morsel had disappeared OEnothea half-drunk by
this time looked at me and said We must now go through with the
mysteries so that you may get back your virility




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-EIGHTH

As she said this OEnothea brought out a leathern dildo which when she
had smeared it with oil ground pepper and pounded nettle seed she
commenced to force little by little up my anus  The merciless old
virago then anointed the insides of my thighs with the same decoction
finally mixing nasturtium juice with elixir of southern wood she gave my
genitals a bath and picking up a bunch of green nettles she commenced
to strike me gently all over my belly below the navel {The nettles stung
me horribly and I suddenly took to my heels with the old hags in full
pursuit}  Although they were befuddled with wine and lust they followed
the right road and chased me through several wards screaming Stop
thief  I made good my escape however although every toe was bleeding
as the result of my headlong flight  I got home as quickly as I could
and worn out with fatigue I sought my couch but I could not snatch a
wink of sleep for the evil adventures which had befallen me kept running
through my brain and brooding upon them I came to the conclusion that
no one could be so abjectly unfortunate  Has Fortune always inimical
to me stood in need of the pangs of love that she might torture me more
cruelly still I cried out unhappy wretch that I am  Fortune and Love
have joined forces to bring about my ruin  Cruel Eros himself had never
dealt leniently with me loved or lover I am put to the torture  Take
the case of Chrysis  she loves me desperately never leaves off teasing
me she who despised me as a servant because when she was acting as her
mistress's go-between I was dressed in the garments of a slave she I
say that same Chrysis who looked with contempt upon your former lowly
lot is now bent upon following it up even at the peril of her life she
swore that she would never leave my side on the day when she told me of
the violence of her passion but Circe owns me heart and soul all
others I despise  Who could be lovelier  than  she  What  loveliness
had Ariadne or Leda to compare with hers  What had Helen to compare with
her what has Venus  If Paris himself had seen her with her dancing
eyes when he acted as umpire for the quarreling goddesses he would have
given up Helen and the goddesses for her  If I could only steal a kiss
if only I might put my arms around that divine that heavenly bosom
perhaps the virility would come back to this body and the parts flaccid
from witchcraft would I believe come into their own  Contempt cannot
tire me out what if I was flogged I will forget it  What if I was
thrown out  I will treat it as a joke  Only let me be restored to her
good graces

At rest on my pallet night's silence had scarce settled down

To soothe me and eyes heavy-laden with slumber to lull

When torturing Amor laid hold of me seizing my hair

And dragging me wounding me ordered a vigil till dawn

Oh heart of stone how canst thou lie here alone said the God

Thou joy of a thousand sweet mistresses how oh my slave'

In disarrayed nightrobe I leap to bare feet and essay

To follow all paths but a road can discover by none

One moment I hasten the next it is torture to move

It irks me again to turn back shame forbids me to halt

And stand in the midst of the road  Lo the voices of men

The roar of the streets and the songs of the birds and the bark

Of vigilant watch-dogs are hushed  Alone I of all

Society dread both my slumber and couch and obey

Great Lord of the Passions thy mandate which on me was laid




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-NINTH

Such thoughts as these of lovely Circe's charms so wrought upon my mind
that I disordered my bed by embracing the image as it were of my
mistress but my efforts were all wasted  This obstinate affliction
finally wore out my patience and I cursed the hostile deity by whom I
was bewitched  I soon recovered my composure however and deriving
some consolation from thinking of the heroes of old who had been
persecuted by the anger of the gods I broke out in these lines

Hostile gods and implacable rate not me alone pursue

Herakles once suffered the weight of heaven's displeasure too

Driven from the Inachian coast Laomedon of old

Sated two of the heavenly host in Pelias behold

Juno's power to avenge an affront and Telephus took arms

Knowing not he must bear the brunt Ulysses feared the storms

Angry Neptune decreed as his due  Now me to overwhelm

Outraged Priapus ever pursues on land and Nereusrealm

Tortured by these cares I spent the whole night in anxiety and at dawn
Giton who had found out that I had slept at home entered the room and
bitterly accused me of leading a licentious life he said that the whole
household was greatly concerned at what I had been doing that I was so
rarely present to attend to my duties and that the intrigue in which I
was engaged would very likely bring about my ruin  I gathered from this
that he had been well informed as to my affairs and that someone had
been to the house inquiring for me  Thereupon I began to ply Giton
with questions as to whether anyone had made inquiry for me Not today
he replied but yesterday a woman came in at the door not bad looking
either and after talking to me for quite a while and wearing me out
with her far-fetched conversation finally ended by saying that you
deserved punishment and that you would receive the scourging of a slave
if the injured party pressed his complaint  This news afflicted me so
bitterly that I levelled fresh recriminations against Fortune and I had
not yet finished grumbling when Chrysis came in and throwing herself
upon me embraced me passionately  I have you she cried just as I
hoped I would you are my heart's desire my joy you can never put out
this flame of mine unless you quench it in my blood  I was greatly
embarrassed by this wantonness of Chrysis and had recourse to flattery
in order that I might rid myself of her as I feared that her passionate
outcries would reach the ears of Eumolpus who in the arrogance of
success had put on the manner of the master  So on this account I did
everything I could think of to calm Chrysis  I feigned love whispered
compliments in short so skillfully did I dissimulate that she believed
I was Love's own captive  I showed her what pressing peril overhung us
should she be caught in that room with me as Eumolpus was only too ready
to punish the slightest offense  On hearing this she left me hurriedly
and all the more quickly as she caught sight of Giton who had only left
me a little before she had come in on his way to my room  She was
scarcely gone when one of the newly engaged servants rushed in and
informed me that the master was furiously angry with me because of my two
daysabsence from duty I would do well therefore to prepare some
plausible excuse as it was not likely that his angry passion would be
placated until someone had been flogged  Seeing that I was so vexed and
disheartened Giton said not a word about the woman contenting himself
with speaking of Eumolpus and advising me that it would be better to
joke with him than to treat the matter seriously  I followed this lead
and appeared before the old fellow with so merry a countenance that
instead of showing severity he received me with good humor and rallied
me upon the success of my love affairs praising the elegance of my
figure which made me such a favorite with the ladies  I know very
well he went on that a lovely woman is dying for love of you
Encolpius and this may come in handy for us so play your part and I'll
play mine too




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTIETH

He was still speaking when in came a matron of the most exclusive
social set Philumene by name who had often when young extorted many
a legacy by means of her charms but an old woman now the flower of her
beauty faded she threw her son and daughter in the way of childless old
men and through this substitution she contrived to continue her
established policy  She came to Eumolpus both to commend her children
to his practical judgment and to entrust herself and her hopes to his
good nature he being the only one in all the world who could daily
instruct young children in healthy precepts  In short she left her
children in Eumolpushouse in order that they might hear the words that
dropped from his lips as this was the only legacy she could leave to
them  Nor did she do otherwise than as she had promised but left in
his bed chamber a very beautiful daughter and her brother a lad and
pretended that she herself was compelled to go out to a temple to offer
up her vows  Eumolpus who was so continent that even I was a boy in his
eyes lost no time in inviting the damsel to sacrifice to the Aversa
Venus but as he had told everyone that he was gouty and that his back
was weak and as he stood in danger of upsetting the whole farce if he
did not carefully live up to the pretence he therefore that the
imposture might be kept up prevailed upon the young lady to seat herself
upon that goodness which had been commended to her and ordered Corax to
crawl under the bed upon which he himself was lying and after bracing
himself by putting his hands upon the floor to hoist his master up and
down with his own back  Corax carried out the order in full and
skillfully seconded the wriggling of the girl with a corresponding
seesaw  Then when the crisis was about due Eumolpus in a ringing
voice called out to Corax to increase the cadence  And thus the old
lecher suspended between his servant and his mistress enjoyed himself
just as if he were in a swing  Time and again Eumolpus repeated this
performance to the accompaniment of ringing laughter in which he himself
joined  At last fearing I might lose an opportunity through lack of
application I also made advances to the brother who was enjoying the
gymnastics of his sister through the keyhole to see if he would prove
amenable to assault  Nor did this well trained lad reject my advances
but alas  I discovered that the God was still my enemy  However I was
not so blue over this failure as I had been over those before and my
virility returned a little later and suddenly finding myself in better
fettle I cried out Great are the gods who have made me whole again
In his loving kindness Mercury who conducts and reconducts the souls
has restored to me that which a hostile hand had cut away  Look  You
will find that I am more graciously endowed than was Protestilaus or any
other of the heroes of old  So saying I lifted up my tunic and showed
Eumolpus that I was whole  At first he was startled then that he might
believe his own eyes he handled this pledge of the good will of the gods
with both hands  Our good humor was revived by this blessing and we
laughed at the diplomacy of Philumene and at the skill with which her
children plied their calling little likely to profit them much with us
however as it was only in hopes of coming into a legacy that she had
abandoned the boy and girl to us  Meditating upon this unscrupulous
method of getting around childless old men I began to take thought of
the present state of our own affairs and made use of the occasion to warn
Eumolpus that he might be bitten in biting the biters  Everything that
we do I said should be dictated by Prudence Socrates {whose
judgment was riper than that} of the gods or of men used to boast that he
had never looked into a tavern nor believed the evidence of his own eyes
in any crowded assembly which was disorderly so nothing is more in
keeping than always conversing with wisdom

Live coals are more readily held in men's mouths than a secret

Whatever you talk of at home will fly forth in an instant

Become a swift rumor and beat at the walls of your city

Nor is it enough that your confidence thus has been broken

As rumor but grows in the telling and strives to embellish

The covetous servant who feared to make public his knowledge

A hole in the ground dug and therein did whisper his secret

That told of a king's hidden ears this the earth straightway
echoed

And rustling reeds added that Midas was king in the story

Every word of this is true I insisted and no one deserves to get into
trouble more quickly than he who covets the goods of others  How could
cheats and swindlers live unless they threw purses or little bags
clinking with money into the crowd for bait  Just as dumb brutes are
enticed by food human beings are not to be caught unless they have
something in the way of hope at which to nibble  That was the reason
that the Crotonians gave us such a satisfactory reception but the ship
does not arrive from Africa with your money and your slaves as you
promised  The patience of the fortune-hunters is worn out and they have
already cut down their liberality so that either I am mistaken or else
our usual luck is about to return to punish you




CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIRST

I have thought up a scheme replied Eumolpus which will embarrass
our fortune-hunting friends sorely and as he said this he drew his
tablets from his wallet and read his last wishes aloud as follows
All who are down for legacies under my will my freedmen only excepted
shall come into what I bequeath them subject to this condition that they
do cut my body into pieces and devour said pieces in sight of the crowd
{nor need they be inordinately shocked} for among some peoples the law
ordaining that the dead shall be devoured by their relatives is still in
force nay even the sick are often abused because they render their own
flesh worse  I admonish my friends by these presents lest they refuse
what I command that they devour my carcass with as great relish as they
damned my soul  Eumolpus had just started reading the first clauses
when several of his most intimate friends entered the room and catching
sight of the tablets in his hand in which was contained his last will and
testament besought him earnestly to permit them to hear the contents
He consented immediately and read the entire instrument from first to
last  But when they had heard that extraordinary stipulation by which
they were under the necessity of devouring his carcass they were greatly
cast down but his reputation for enormous wealth dulled the eyes and
brains of the wretches and they were such cringing sycophants that they
dared not complain of the outrage in his hearing  One there was
nevertheless named Gorgias who was willing to comply provided he did
not have too long to wait  To this Eumolpus made answer I have no
fear that your stomach will turn it will obey orders if for one hour
of nausea you promise it a plethora of good things just shut your eyes
and pretend that it's not human guts you've bolted but ten million
sesterces  And beside we will find some condiment which will disguise
the taste  No flesh is palatable of itself it must be seasoned by art
and reconciled to the unwilling stomach  And if you desire to fortify
the plan by precedents the Saguntines ate human flesh when besieged by
Hannibal and they had no legacy in prospect  In stress of famine the
inhabitants of Petelia did the same and gained nothing from the diet
except that they were not hungry  When Numantia was taken by Scipio
mothers with the half-eaten bodies of their babes in their bosoms were
found  Therefore since it is only the thought of eating human flesh
that makes you squeamish you must try to overcome your aversion with
all your heart so that you may come into the immense legacies I have put
you down for  So carelessly did Eumolpus reel off these extravagances
that the fortune-hunters began to lose faith in the validity of his
promises and subjected our words and actions to a closer scrutiny
immediately their suspicions grew with their experience and they came
to the conclusion that we were out and out grafters and thereupon those
who had been put to the greatest expense for our entertainment resolved
to seize us and take it out in just revenge but Chrysis who was privy
to all their scheming informed me of the designs which the Crotonians
had hatched and when I heard this news I was so terrified that I fled
instantly with Giton and left Eumolpus to his fate  I learned a few
days later that the Crotonians furious because the old fox had lived
so long and so sumptuously at the public expense had put him to death
in the Massilian manner  That you may comprehend what this means know
that whenever the Massilians were ravaged by the plague one of the poor
would offer himself to be fed for a whole year upon choice food at public
charge after which decked out with olive branches and sacred vestments
he was led out through the entire city loaded with imprecations so that
he might take to himself the evils from which the city suffered and then
thrown headlong from the cliff


My company was charming

Opposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus she was
not a casual woman of the half-world who under this pseudonym wages
war against the enemy sex like Mademoiselle Cleopatra but the real
true goddess of love

She sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire whose
reflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes
and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them

Her head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes it was all
I could see of her She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge
fur and rolled herself up trembling like a cat

I don't understand it I exclaimed It isn't really cold any
longer For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather You
must be nervous

Much obliged for your spring she replied with a low stony voice
and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely twice in succession I
really can't stand it here much longer and I am beginning to
understand 

What dear lady

I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the
un-understandable All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of
woman and German philosophy and I am no longer surprised that you of
the North do not know how to love haven't even an idea of what love
is

But madame I replied flaring up I surely haven't given you any
reason

Oh you  The divinity sneezed for the third time and shrugged
her shoulders with inimitable grace That's why I have always been
nice to you and even come to see you now and then although I catch
a cold every time in spite of all my furs Do you remember the first
time we met

How could I forget it I said You wore your abundant hair in
brown curls and you had brown eyes and a red mouth but I recognized
you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like
pallor you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with
squirrel-skin

You were really in love with the costume and awfully docile

You have taught me what love is Your serene form of worship let me
forget two thousand years

And my faithfulness to you was without equal

Well as far as faithfulness goes 

Ungrateful

I will not reproach you with anything You are a divine woman but
nevertheless a woman and like every woman cruel in love

What you call cruel the goddess of love replied eagerly is
simply the element of passion and of natural love which is woman's
nature and makes her give herself where she loves and makes her love
everything that pleases her

Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the
unfaithfulness of the woman he loves

Indeed she replied We are faithful as long as we love but you
demand faithfulness of a woman without love and the giving of
herself without enjoyment Who is cruel there woman or man You of
the North in general take love too soberly and seriously You talk
of duties where there should be only a question of pleasure

That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous and our
relations permanent

And yet a restless always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of
paganism she interrupted but that love which is the highest joy
which is divine simplicity itself is not for you moderns you
children of reflection It works only evil in you As soon as you
wish to be natural you become common To you nature seems something
hostile you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece and
out of me a demon You can only exorcise and curse me or slay
yourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar And if ever one of
you has had the courage to kiss my red mouth he makes a barefoot
pilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow
from his withered staff while under my feet roses violets and
myrtles spring up every hour but their fragrance does not agree with
you Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense let us
pagans remain under the debris beneath the lava do not disinter us
Pompeii was not built for you nor our villas our baths our temples
You do not require gods We are chilled in your world

The beautiful marble woman coughed and drew the dark sables still
closer about her shoulders

Much obliged for the classical lesson I replied but you cannot
deny that man and woman are mortal enemies in your serene sunlit
world as well as in our foggy one In love there is union into a
single being for a short time only capable of only one thought one
sensation one will in order to be then further disunited And you
know this better than I whichever of the two fails to subjugate will
soon feel the feet of the other on his neck 

And as a rule the man that of the woman cried Madame Venus with
proud mockery which you know better than I

Of course and that is why I don't have any illusions

You mean you are now my slave without illusions and for that
reason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy

Madame

Don't you know me yet Yes I am cruel since you take so much
delight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so Man is the one
who desires woman the one who is desired This is woman's entire but
decisive advantage Through his passion nature has given man into
woman's hands and the woman who does not know how to make him her
subject her slave her toy and how to betray him with a smile in the
end is not wise

Exactly your principles I interrupted angrily

They are based on the experience of thousands of years she
replied ironically while her white fingers played over the dark fur
The more devoted a woman shows herself the sooner the man sobers
down and becomes domineering The more cruelly she treats him and the
more faithless she is the worse she uses him the more wantonly she
plays with him the less pity she shows him by so much the more will
she increase his desire be loved worshipped by him So it has
always been since the time of Helen and Delilah down to Catherine
the Second and Lola Montez

I cannot deny I said that nothing will attract a man more than
the picture of a beautiful passionate cruel and despotic woman who
wantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her
whim 

And in addition wears furs exclaimed the divinity

What do you mean by that

I know your predilection

Do you know I interrupted that since we last saw each other
you have grown very coquettish

In what way may I ask

In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater
advantage than by these dark furs and that 

The divinity laughed

You are dreaming she cried wake up and she clasped my arm
with her marble-white hand Do wake up she repeated raucously with
the low register of her voice I opened my eyes with difficulty

I saw the hand which shook me and suddenly it was brown as bronze
the voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who
stood before me at his full height of nearly six feet

Do get up continued the good fellow it is really disgraceful

What is disgraceful

To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides He snuffed
the candles which had burned down and picked up the volume which had
fallen from my hand with a book by he looked at the title page 
by Hegel Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr
Severin's who is expecting us for tea

A curious dream said Severin when I had finished He supported
his arms on his knees resting his face in his delicate finely
veined hands and fell to pondering

I knew that he wouldn't move for a long time hardly even breathe This
actually happened but I didn't consider his behavior as in any way
remarkable I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly
three years and gotten used to his peculiarities For it cannot be
denied that he was peculiar although he wasn't quite the dangerous
madman that the neighborhood or indeed the entire district of Kolomea
considered him to be I found his personality not only interesting and
that is why many also regarded me a bit mad but to a degree
sympathetic For a Galician nobleman and land-owner and considering his
age he was hardly over thirty he displayed surprising sobriety a
certain seriousness even pedantry He lived according to a minutely
elaborated half-philosophical half-practical system like clock-work
not this alone but also by the thermometer barometer aerometer
hydrometer Hippocrates Hufeland Plato Kant Knigge and Lord
Chesterfield But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion and
gave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a
wall At such times every one preferred to get out of his way

While he remained silent the fire sang in the chimney and the large
venerable samovar sang and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking
to and fro smoking my cigar and the cricket in the old walls sang
too I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus skeletons of
animals stuffed birds globes plaster-casts with which his room
was heaped full until by chance my glance remained fixed on a
picture which I had seen often enough before But to-day under the
reflected red glow of the fire it made an indescribable impression
on me

It was a large oil painting done in the robust full-bodied manner
of the Belgian school Its subject was strange enough

A beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face with abundant
hair tied into a classical knot on which white powder lay like a
soft hoarfrost was resting on an ottoman supported on her left arm
She was nude in her dark furs Her right hand played with a lash
while her bare foot rested carelessly on a man lying before her like
a slave like a dog In the sharply outlined but well-formed
linaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate
devotion he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a
martyr This man the footstool for her feet was Severin but
beardless and it seemed some ten years younger

Venus in Furs I cried pointing to the picture That is the way
I saw her in my dream

I too said Severin only I dreamed my dream with open eyes

Indeed

It is a tiresome story

Your picture apparently suggested my dream I continued But do
tell me what it means I can imagine that it played a role in your
life and perhaps a very decisive one But the details I can only get
from you

Look at its counterpart replied my strange friend without
heeding my question

The counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian's well-known Venus
with the Mirror in the Dresden Gallery

And what is the significance

Severin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which
Titian garbed his goddess of love

It too is aVenus in Furshe said with a slight smile I
don't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention He
simply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina and was
tactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her
majestic allure with cold satisfaction He looks as though his task
were becoming burdensome enough The picture is painted flattery
Later anexpertin the Rococo period baptized the lady with the
name of Venus The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model
wrapped herself probably more for fear of a cold than out of
modesty have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that
constitute woman's essence and her beauty

But enough of that The picture as it now exists is a bitter
satire on our love Venus in this abstract North in this icy
Christian world has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch
cold 

Severin laughed and lighted a fresh cigarette

Just then the door opened and an attractive stoutish blonde girl
entered She had wise kindly eyes was dressed in black silk and
brought us cold meat and eggs with our tea Severin took one of the
latter and decapitated it with his knife

Didn't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled he cried with a
violence that made the young woman tremble

But my dear Sevtchu  she said timidly

Sevtchu nothing he yelled you are to obey obey do you
understand and he tore the kantchuk Footnote A long whip with a
short handle which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook

The woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe

Just wait I'll get you yet he called after her

But Severin I said placing my hand on his arm how can you treat
a pretty young woman thus

Look at the woman he replied blinking humorously with his eyes
Had I flattered her she would have cast the noose around my neck
but now when I bring her up with the kantchuk she adores me

Nonsense

Nonsense nothing that is the way you have to break in women

Well if you like it live like a pasha in your harem but don't
lay down theories for me 

Why not he said animatedly Goethe'syou must be hammer or anvil'
is absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman
Didn't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you Woman's power lies
in man's passion and she knows how to use it if man doesn't
understand himself He has only one choice to be the tyrant over or
the slave of woman As soon as he gives in his neck is under the
yoke and the lash will soon fall upon him

Strange maxims

Not maxims but experiences he replied nodding his head I have
actually felt the lash I am cured Do you care to know how

He rose and got a small manuscript from his massive desk and put
it in front of me

You have already asked about the picture I have long owed you an
explanation Here read

Severin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me and seemed
to dream with open eyes Silence had fallen again and again the fire
sang in the chimney and the samovar and the cricket in the old
walls I opened the manuscript and read

CONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN

The margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known
lines from Faust

Thou supersensual sensual wooer
A woman leads you by the nose
MEPHISTOPHELES

I turned the title-page and read What follows has been compiled
from my diary of that period because it is impossible ever frankly
to write of one's past but in this way everything retains its fresh
colors the colors of the present

Gogol the Russian Moliere says where well somewhere the real
comic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down

A wonderful saying

So I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down The
atmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers
which overcomes me and gives me a headache The smoke of the
fireplace curls and condenses into figures small gray-bearded
kokolds that mockingly point their finger at me Chubby-cheeked
cupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees I have to smile
involuntarily even laugh aloud as I am writing down my adventures
Yet I am not writing with ordinary ink but with red blood that drips
from my heart All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it
throbs and hurts and now and then a tear falls on the paper

The days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort
You see no one and no one sees you It is boring enough to write idyls
I would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings
furnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season a dozen
virtuosos with concertos trios and duos but what am I saying the
upshot of it all is that I don't do much more than to stretch the
canvas smooth the bow line the scores For I am no false modesty
Friend Severin you can lie to others but you don't quite succeed any
longer in lying to yourself I am nothing but a dilettante a dilettante
in painting in poetry in music and several other of the so-called
unprofitable arts which however at present secure for their masters
the income of a cabinet minister or even that of a minor potentate
Above all else I am a dilettante in life

Up to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry
I never got far beyond the preparation the plan the first act the
first stanza There are people like that who begin everything and
never finish anything I am such a one

But what am I saying

To the business in hand

I lie in my window and the miserable little town which fills me
with despondency really seems infinitely full of poetry How
wonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven
with golden sunlight mountain-torrents weave through them like
ribbons of silver How clear and blue the heavens into which
snowcapped crags project how green and fresh the forested slopes
the meadows on which small herds graze down to the yellow billows
of grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again

The house in which I live stands in a sort of park or forest or
wilderness whatever one wants to call it and is very solitary

Its sole inhabitants are myself a widow from Lemberg and Madame
Tartakovska who runs the house a little old woman who grows older
and smaller each day There are also an old dog that limps on one
leg and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn This
ball of yarn I believe belongs to the widow

She is said to be really beautiful this widow still very young
twenty-four at the most and very rich She dwells in the first story
and I on the ground floor She always keeps the green blinds drawn and
has a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants I for my
part down below have a comfortable intimate arbor of honeysuckle in
which I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs I
can look up on the balcony Sometimes I actually do so and then from
time to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network

Really the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much for I
am in love with someone else and terribly unhappy at that far more
unhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon
l'Escault because the object of my adoration is of stone

In the garden in the tiny wilderness there is a graceful little
meadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully On this meadow is
a stone statue of Venus the original of which I believe is in
Florence This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in
all my life

That however does not signify much for I have seen few beautiful
women or rather few women at all In love too I am a dilettante who
never got beyond the preparation the first act

But why talk in superlatives as if something that is beautiful
could be surpassed

It is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful I love her
passionately with a morbid intensity madly as one can only love a
woman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally
uniform eternally calm stony smile I literally adore her

I often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when
the sun broods over the forest Often I visit that cold cruel
mistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her with the
face pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest and
my prayers go up to her

The rising moon which just now is waning produces an indescribable
effect It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow
in its gleam of silver The goddess stands as if transfigured and
seems to bathe in the soft moonlight

Once when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks
leading to the house I suddenly saw a woman's figure white as
stone under the illumination of the moon and separated from me
merely by a screen of trees It seemed as if the beautiful woman of
marble had taken pity on me become alive and followed me I was
seized by a nameless fear my heart threatened to burst and instead 

Well I am a dilettante As always I broke down at the second
stanza rather on the contrary I did not break down but ran away
as fast as my legs would carry me

                            

What an accident Through a Jew dealing in photographs I secured a
picture of my ideal It is a small reproduction of Titian's Venus
with the Mirror What a woman I want to write a poem but instead
I take the reproduction and write on it Venus in Furs

You are cold while you yourself fan flames By all means wrap
yourself in your despotic furs there is no one to whom they are more
appropriate cruel goddess of love and of beauty After a while I add
a few verses from Goethe which I recently found in his paralipomena
to Faust

TO AMOR

The pair of wings a fiction are
The arrows they are naught but claws
The wreath conceals the little horns
For without any doubt he is
Like all the gods of ancient Greece
Only a devil in disguise

Then I put the picture before me on my table supporting it with a
book and looked at it

I was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by
the cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms
in her furs of dark sable by the severity and hardness which lay in
this cold marble-like face Again I took my pen in hand and wrote
the following words

To love to be loved what happiness And yet how the glamour of
this pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a
woman who makes a plaything out of us of being the slave of a
beautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot Even Samson the
hero the giant again put himself into the hands of Delilah even
after she had betrayed him and again she betrayed him and the
Philistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end
he kept fixed drunken with rage and love upon the beautiful
betrayer

I was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor and reading in the Book
of Judith I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman
who cut off his head with a sword and because of his beautiful
sanguinary end

The almighty Lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into the
hands of a woman

This sentence strangely impressed me

How ungallant these Jews are I thought And their God might choose
more becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex

The almighty Lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into the
hands of a woman I repeated to myself What shall I do so that He
may punish me

Heaven preserve us Here comes the housekeeper who has again
diminished somewhat in size overnight And up there among the green
twinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again Is it Venus
or the widow

This time it happens to be the widow for Madame Tartakovska makes
a courtesy and asks me in her name for something to read I run to
my room and gather together a couple of volumes

Later I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them and now
it and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there
together What will she say

I hear her laugh

Is she laughing at me

It is full moon It is already peering over the tops of the low
hemlocks that fringe the park A silvery exhalation fills the
terrace the groups of trees all the landscape as far as the eye
can reach in the distance it gradually fades away like trembling
waters

I cannot resist I feel a strange urge and call within me I put on
my clothes again and go out into the garden

Some power draws me toward the meadow toward her who is my
divinity and my beloved

The night is cool I feel a slight chill The atmosphere is heavy
with the odor of flowers and of the forest It intoxicates

What solemnity What music round about A nightingale sobs The
stars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour The meadow seems
smooth like a mirror like a covering of ice on a pond

The statue of Venus stands out august and luminous

But what has happened From the marble shoulders of the goddess a
large dark fur flows down to her heels I stand dumbfounded and stare
at her in amazement again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me
and I take flight

I hasten my steps and notice that I have missed the main path As
I am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus
sitting before me on a stone bench not the beautiful woman of
marble but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing
pulses She has actually come to life for me like the statue that
began to breathe for her creator Indeed the miracle is only half
completed Her white hair seems still to be of stone and her white
gown shimmers like moonlight or is it satin From her shoulders the
dark fur flows But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks
begin to take color Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall
upon me and now she laughs

Her laughter is very mysterious very I don't know It cannot be
described it takes my breath away I flee further and after every
few steps I have to pause to take breath The mocking laughter
pursues me through the dark leafy paths across light open spaces
through the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce I can no
longer find my way I wander about utterly confused with cold drops
of perspiration on the forehead

Finally I stand still and engage in a short monologue

It runs well one is either very polite to one's self or very rude

I say to myself

Donkey

This word exercises a remarkable effect like a magic formula which
sets me free and makes me master of myself

I am perfectly quiet in a moment

With considerable pleasure I repeat Donkey

Now everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again
There is the fountain there the alley of box-wood there the house
which I am slowly approaching

Yet suddenly the appearance is here again Behind the green screen
through which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with
silver I again see the white figure the woman of stone whom I
adore whom I fear and flee

With a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and
reflect

What am I really a little dilettante or a great big donkey

A sultry morning the atmosphere is dead heavily laden with odors
yet stimulating Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor reading
in the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers
into beasts A wonderful picture of antique love

There is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my
book rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling

A woman's dress 

She is there Venus but without furs No this time it is merely
the widow and yet Venus-oh what a woman

As she stands there in her light white morning gown looking at me her
slight figure seems full of poetry and grace She is neither large nor
small her head is alluring piquant in the sense of the period of the
French marquises rather than formally beautiful What enchantment and
softness what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth Her
skin is so infinitely delicate that the blue veins show through
everywhere even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom How
abundant her red hair-it is red not blonde or golden-yellow how
diabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck Now her eyes
meet mine like green lightnings they are green these eyes of hers
whose power is so indescribable green but as are precious stones or
deep unfathomable mountain lakes

She observes my confusion which has even made me discourteous for I
have remained seated and still have my cap on my head

She smiles roguishly

Finally I rise and bow to her She comes closer and bursts out into
a loud almost childlike laughter I stammer as only a little
dilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion

Thus our acquaintance began

The divinity asks for my name and mentions her own

Her name is Wanda von Dunajew

And she is actually my Venus

But madame what put the idea into your head

The little picture in one of your books 

I had forgotten about it

The curious notes on its back 

Why curious

She looked at me

I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time for the sake
of the change and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe

Dear lady in fact  Again I fell victim to an odious asinine
stammering and in addition blushed in a way that might have been
appropriate for a youngster of sixteen but not for me who was
almost a full ten years older 

You were afraid of me last night

Really of course but won't you sit down

She sat down and enjoyed my embarrassment for actually I was even
more afraid of her now in the full light of day A delightful
expression of contempt hovered about her upper lip

You look at love and especially woman she began as something
hostile something against which you put up a defense even if
unsuccessfully You feel that their power over you gives you a
sensation of pleasurable torture of pungent cruelty This is a
genuinely modern point of view

You don't share it

I do not share it she said quickly and decisively shaking her
head so that her curls flew up like red flames

The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene
sensuousness of the Greeks pleasure without pain I do not believe
in the kind of love which is preached by Christianity by the
moderns by the knights of the spirit Yes look at me I am worse
than a heretic I am a pagan

Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel
When in Ida's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles'

These lines from Goethe's Roman Elegy have always delighted me

In nature there is only the love of the heroic agewhen gods and
goddesses lovedAt that timedesire followed the glance enjoyment
desireAll else is factitious affected a lie Christianity whose
cruel emblem the cross has always had for me an element of the
monstrous brought something alien and hostile into nature and its
innocent instincts

The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern
man I do not care to have a share in it

Yes Mount Olympus would be the place for you madame I replied
but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity least of
all in love The idea of sharing a woman even if it were an Aspasia
with another revolts us We are jealous as is our God For example
we have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne

We prefer one of Holbein's meagre pallid virgins which is wholly
ours to an antique Venus no matter how divinely beautiful she is
but who loves Anchises to-day Paris to-morrow Adonis the day after
And if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing
passionate devotion to such a woman her serene joy of life appears
to us as something demonic and cruel and we read into our happiness
a sin which we must expiate

So you too are one of those who rave about modern women those
miserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a real
man in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine
ideal Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian
duties they cheat and are cheated they always seek again and choose
and reject they are never happy and never give happiness They
accuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and
live as Helen and Aspasia lived Nature admits of no permanence in
the relation between man and woman

But my dear lady 

Let me finish It is only man's egoism which wants to keep woman
like some buried treasure All endeavors to introduce permanence in
love the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence
have gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies vows and
legalities Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself
over to corruption

But 

But you are about to say the individual who rebels against the
arrangements of society is ostracized branded stoned So be it I
am willing to take the risk my principles are very pagan I will
live my own life as it pleases me I am willing to do without your
hypocritical respect I prefer to be happy The inventors of the
Christian marriage have done well simultaneously to invent
immortality I however have no wish to live eternally When with
my last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned
comes to an end here below what does it profit me whether my pure
spirit joins the choirs of angels or whether my dust goes into the
formation of new beings Shall I belong to one man whom I don't love
merely because I have once loved him No I do not renounce I love
everyone who pleases me and give happiness to everyone who loves me
Is that ugly No it is more beautiful by far than if cruelly I
enjoy the tortures which my beauty excites and virtuously reject
the poor fellow who is pining away for me I am young rich and
beautiful and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and
enjoyment

While she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly and I had taken
hold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them but
being a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again

Your frankness I said delights me and not it alone 

My confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were
a rope around my neck

You were about to say 

I was about to say I was I am sorry I interrupted you

How so

A long pause She is doubtless engaging in a monologue which
translated into my language would be comprised in the single word
donkey

If I may ask I finally began how did you arrive at these these
conclusions

Quite simply my father was an intelligent man From my cradle onward
I was surrounded by replicas of ancient art at ten years of age I
read Gil Blas at twelve La Pucelle Where others had
Hop-o'-my-thumb Bluebeard Cinderella as childhood friends mine
were Venus and Apollo Hercules and Lackoon My husband's personality
was filled with serenity and sunlight Not even the incurable illness
which fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow
On the very night of his death he took me in his arms and during the
many months when he lay dying in his wheel chair he often said
jokingly to meWell have you already picked out a loverI blushed
with shameDon't deceive mehe added on one occasionthat would
seem ugly to me but pick out an attractive lover or preferably
several You are a splendid woman but still half a child and you
need toys'

I suppose I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had
no lover but it was through him that I have become what I am a
woman of Greece

A goddess I interrupted

Which one she smiled

Venus

She threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows Perhaps
even aVenus in FursWatch out I have a large very large fur
with which I could cover you up entirely and I have a mind to catch
you in it as in a net

Do you believe I said quickly for an idea which seemed good in
spite of its conventionality and triteness flashed into my head do
you believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the
present time that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity
among our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and
serenity

Undraped of course not but in furs she replied smiling would
you care to see mine

And then 

What then

Beautiful free serene and happy human beings such as the Greeks
were are only possible when it is permitted to have slaves who will
perform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else
labor for them

Of course she replied playfully an Olympian divinity such as
I am requires a whole army of slaves Beware of me

Why

I myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this
why it did not startle her in the least

She drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became
visible and then said lightly as if she were discussing some
trifling matter Do you want to be my slave

There is no equality in love I replied solemnly Whenever it is
a matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled it seems much
more satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman But
where shall I find the woman who knows how to rule calmly full of
self-confidence even harshly and not seek to gain her power by
means of petty nagging

Oh that might not be so difficult

You think 

I for instance  she laughed and leaned far back I have a real
talent for despotism I also have the necessary furs but last night
you were really seriously afraid of me

Quite seriously

And now

Now I am more afraid of you than ever

We are together every day I and Venus we are together a great
deal We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor and have tea in her
little sitting-room I have an opportunity to unfold all my small
very small talents Of what use would have been my study of all the
various sciences my playing at all the arts if I were unable in the
case of a pretty little woman 

But this woman is by no means little in fact she impresses me
tremendously I made a drawing of her to-day and felt particularly
clearly how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a
cameo-head like hers The configuration of her face has little of the
Roman but much of the Greek

Sometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche and then again as
Astarte It depends upon the expression in her eyes whether it is
vaguely dreamy or half-consuming filled with tired desire
She however insists that it be a portrait-likeness

I shall make her a present of furs

How could I have any doubts If not for her for whom would princely
furs be suitable

                            

I was with her yesterday evening reading the Roman Elegies to her
Then I laid the book aside and improvised something for her She
seemed pleased rather more than that she actually hung upon my
words and her bosom heaved

Or was I mistaken

The rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes the fire
crackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort I felt quite at home
with her and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman
I kissed her hand and she permitted it

Then I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for
her

VENUS IN FURS

Place thy foot upon thy slave
Oh thou half of hell half of dreams
Among the shadows dark and grave
Thy extended body softly gleams

And so on This time I really got beyond the first stanza At her
request I gave her the poem in the evening keeping no copy And now
as I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first
stanza

I am filled with a very curious sensation I don't believe that I am
in love with Wanda I am sure that at our first meeting I felt
nothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion But I feel how her
extraordinary really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares
about me It isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me it
is a physical subjection coming on slowly but for that reason more
absolutely

I suffer under it more and more each day and she she merely smiles

                            

Without any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day You
interest me Most men are very commonplace without verve or poetry
In you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a
deep seriousness which delight me I might learn to love you

After a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow
and the statue of Venus All about us the earth steamed mists rose
up toward heaven like clouds of incense a shattered rainbow still
hovered in the air The trees were still shedding drops but sparrows
and finches were already hopping from twig to twig They are
twittering gaily as if very much pleased at something Everything
is filled with a fresh fragrance We cannot cross the meadow for it
is still wet In the sunlight it looks like a small pool and the
goddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like
surface About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing which
illuminated by the sun seem to hover above her like an aureole

Wanda is enjoying the lovely scene As all the benches along the
walk are still wet she supports herself on my arm to rest a while
A soft weariness permeates her whole being her eyes are half closed
I feel the touch of her breath on my cheek

How I managed to get up courage enough I really don't know but I
took hold of her hand asking

Could you love me

Why not she replied letting her calm clear look rest upon me
but not for long

A moment later I am kneeling before her pressing my burning face
against the fragrant muslin of her gown

But Severin this isn't right she cried

But I take hold of her little foot and press my lips upon it

You are getting worse and worse she cried She tore herself free
and fled rapidly toward the house the while her adorable slipper
remained in my hand

Is it an omen

                            

All day long I didn't dare to go near her Toward evening as I was
sitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the
greenery of her balcony Why don't you come up he called down
impatiently

I ran upstairs and at the top lost courage again I knocked very
lightly She didn't say come-in but opened the door herself and
stood on the threshold

Where is my slipper

It is I have I want I stammered

Get it and then we will have tea together and chat

When I returned she was engaged in making tea I ceremoniously
placed the slipper on the table and stood in the corner like a child
awaiting punishment

I noticed that her brows were slightly contracted and there was an
expression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted
me

All of a sudden she broke out laughing

So you are really in love with me

Yes and I suffer more from it than you can imagine

You suffer she laughed again

I was revolted mortified annihilated but all this was quite
useless

Why she continued I like you with all my heart

She gave me her hand and looked at me in the friendliest fashion

And will you be my wife

Wanda looked at me how did she look at me I think first of all
with surprise and then with a tinge of irony

What has given you so much courage all at once

Courage

Yes courage to ask anyone to be your wife and me in particular
She lifted up the slipper Was it through a sudden friendship with
this But joking aside Do you really wish to marry me

Yes

Well Severin that is a serious matter I believe you love me
and I care for you too and what is more important each of us finds
the other interesting There is no danger that we would soon get
bored but you know I am a fickle person and just for that reason
I take marriage seriously If I assume obligations I want to be able
to meet them But I am afraid no it would hurt you

Please be perfectly frank with me I replied

Well then honestly I don't believe I could love a man longer than 
She inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused

A year

What do you imagine a month perhaps

Not even me

Oh you perhaps two

Two months I exclaimed

Two months is very long

You go beyond antiquity madame

You see you cannot stand the truth

Wanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace
watching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece

What shall I do with you she began anew

Whatever you wish I replied with resignation whatever will give
you pleasure

How illogical she cried first you want to make me your wife
and then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with

Wanda I love you

Now we are back to the place where we started You love me and
want to make me your wife but I don't want to enter into a new
marriage because I doubt the permanence of both my and your
feelings

But if I am willing to take the risk with you I replied

But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you
she said quietly I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my
entire life but he would have to be a whole man a man who would
dominate me who would subjugate me by his inate strength do you
understand And every man I know this very well as soon as he falls
in love becomes weak pliable ridiculous He puts himself into the
woman's hands kneels down before her The only man whom I could love
permanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel I've gotten
to like you so much however that I'll try it with you

I fell down at her feet

For heaven's sake here you are kneeling already she said
mockingly You are making a good beginning When I had risen again
she continued I will give you a year's time to win me to convince
me that we are suited to each other that we might live together If
you succeed I will become your wife and a wife Severin who will
conscientiously and strictly perform all her duties During this year
we will live as though we were married 

My blood rose to my head

In her eyes too there was a sudden flame 

We will live together she continued share our daily life so that
we may find out whether we are really fitted for each other I grant
you all the rights of a husband of a lover of a friend Are you
satisfied

I suppose I'll have to be

You don't have to

Well then I want to 

Splendid That is how a man speaks Here is my hand

                            

For ten days I have been with her every hour except at night All
the time I was allowed to look into her eyes hold her hands listen
to what she said accompany her wherever she went

My love seems to me like a deep bottomless abyss into which I
subside deeper and deeper There is nothing now which could save me
from it

This afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the
Venus-statue I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap she
wound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess

Suddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became
confused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration Losing
command over myself I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips
and she she drew me close to her heaving breast

Are you angry I then asked her

I am never angry at anything that is natural  she replied but
I am afraid you suffer

Oh I am suffering frightfully

Poor friend she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head I
hope it isn't through any fault of mine

No  I replied and yet my love for you has become a sort of
madness The thought that I might lose you perhaps actually lose
you torments me day and night

But you don't yet possess me said Wanda and again she looked at
me with that vibrant consuming expression which had already once
before carried me away Then she rose and with her small transparent
hands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head
of Venus Half against my will I threw my arm around her body

I can no longer live without you oh wonderful woman I said
Believe me believe only this once that this time it is not a
phrase not a thing of dreams I feel deep down in my innermost soul
that my life belongs inseparably with yours If you leave me I shall
perish go to pieces

That will hardly be necessary for I love you she took hold of my
chin you foolish man

But you will be mine only under conditions while I belong to you
unconditionally 

That isn't wise Severin she replied almost with a start Don't
you know me yet do you absolutely refuse to know me I am good when
I am treated seriously and reasonably but when you abandon yourself
too absolutely to me I grow arrogant 

So be it be arrogant be despotic I cried in the fulness of
exaltation only be mine mine forever I lay at her feet
embracing her knees

Things will end badly my friend she said soberly without moving

It shall never end I cried excitedly almost violently Only death
shall part us If you cannot be mine all mine and for always then I
want to be your slave serve you suffer everything from you if only
you won't drive me away

Calm yourself she said bending down and kissing my forehead I
am really very fond of you but your way is not the way to win and
hold me

I want to do everything absolutely everything that you want only
not to lose you I cried only not that I cannot bear the thought

Do get up

I obeyed

You are a strange person continued Wanda You wish to possess me
at any price

Yes at any price

But of what value for instance would that be She pondered a
lurking uncanny expression entered her eyes If I no longer loved
you if I belonged to another

A shudder ran through me I looked at her She stood firmly and
confident before me and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam

You see she continued the very thought frightens you A
beautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face

I feel a perfect horror when I imagine that the woman I love and
who has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless
of me But have I still a choice If I love such a woman even unto
madness shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake
of a bit of boastful strength shall I send a bullet through my
brains I have two ideals of woman If I cannot obtain the one that
is noble and simple the woman who will faithfully and truly share
my life well then I don't want anything half-way or lukewarm Then
I would rather be subject to a woman without virtue fidelity or pity
Such a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal If
I am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love fully and wholly
I want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs I want to
be maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love and the more cruelly
the better This too is a luxury

Have you lost your senses cried Wanda

I love you with all my soul I continued with all my senses and
your presence and personality are absolutely essential to me if I
am to go on living Choose between my ideals Do with me what you will
make of me your husband or your slave

Very well said Wanda contracting her small but strongly arched
brows it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man
who interests me and loves me completely in my power at least I
shall not lack pastime You were imprudent enough to leave the choice
to me Therefore I choose I want you to be my slave I shall make
a plaything for myself out of you

Oh please do I cried half-shuddering half-enraptured If the
foundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement it is
likewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites We
are such opposites almost enemies That is why my love is part hate
part fear In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other
anvil I wish to be the anvil I cannot be happy when I look down
upon the woman I love I want to adore a woman and this I can only
do when she is cruel towards me

But Severin replied Wanda almost angrily do you believe me
capable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do and whom I love

Why not if I adore you the more on this account It is possible to
love really only that which stands above us a woman who through her
beauty temperament intelligence and strength of will subjugates us
and becomes a despot over us

Then that which repels others attracts you

Yes That is the strange part of me

Perhaps after all there isn't anything so very unique or strange
in all your passions for who doesn't love beautiful furs And
everyone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are
related

But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest
degree I replied

In other words reason has little power over you and you are by
nature soft sensual yielding

Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature

The martyrs

On the contrary they were supersensual men who found enjoyment in
suffering They sought out the most frightful tortures even death
itself as others seek joy and as they were so am I supersensual

Have a care that in being such you do not become a martyr to love
the martyr of a woman

We are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant
summer night A twofold roof is above us first the green ceiling of
climbing-plants and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable
stars The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park I am
sitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity and am telling her
of my childhood

And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked
in you asked Wanda

Of course I can't remember a time when I didn't have them Even in
my cradle so mother has told me I was supersensual I scorned the
healthy breast of my nurse and had to be brought up on goatsmilk
As a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women which really was
only an expression of an inordinate interest in them I was oppressed
by the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church and actually
afraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints Secretly
however I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood
in my father's little library I kneeled down before her and to her I
said the prayers I had been taught the Paternoster the Ave Maria
and the Credo

Once at night I left my bed to visit her The sickle of the moon
was my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light I
prostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet as I had seen
our peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior

An irresistible yearning seized me

I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold
lips A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled and later in a dream
it seemed to me as if the goddess stood beside my bed threatening
me with up-raised arm

I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium I
passionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world
of antiquity accessible to me Soon I was more familiar with the gods
of Greece than with the religion of Jesus I was with Paris when he
gave the fateful apple to Venus I saw Troy burn and followed
Ulysses on his wanderings The prototypes of all that is beautiful
sank deep into my soul and consequently at the time when other boys
are coarse and obscene I displayed an insurmountable aversion to
everything base vulgar unbeautiful

To me the maturing youth love for women seemed something
especially base and unbeautiful for it showed itself to me first in
all its commonness I avoided all contact with the fair sex in
short I was supersensual to madness

When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid
young attractive with a figure just budding into womanhood I was
sitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the
virtues of the ancient Teutons while she was sweeping my room
Suddenly she stopped bent down over me in the meantime holding fast
to the broom and a pair of fresh full adorable lips touched mine
The kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder
but I raised up my Germania like a shield against the temptress
and indignantly left the room

Wanda broke out in loud laughter It would indeed be hard to find
another man like you but continue

There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period
I continued my story Countess Sobol a distant aunt of mine was
visiting my parents She was a beautiful majestic woman with an
attractive smile I however hated her for she was regarded by the
family as a sort of Messalina My behavior toward her was as rude
malicious and awkward as possible

One day my parents drove to the capital of the district My aunt
determined to take advantage of their absence and to exercise
judgment over me She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined
kazabaika Footnote A woman's jacket followed by the cook
kitchen-maid and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned
Without asking any questions they seized me and bound me hand and
foot in spite of my violent resistance Then my aunt with an evil
smile rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch
She whipped so hard that the blood flowed and that at last
notwithstanding my heroic spirit I cried and wept and begged for
mercy She then had me untied but I had to get down on my knees and
thank her for the punishment and kiss her hand

Now you understand the supersensual fool Under the lash of a
beautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman In her
fur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen and from then on
my aunt became the most desirable woman on God's earth

My Cato-like austerity my shyness before woman was nothing but an
excessive feeling for beauty In my imagination sensuality became a
sort of cult I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its
holy wealth upon any ordinary person but I would reserve it for an
ideal woman if possible for the goddess of love herself

I went to the university at a very early age It was in the capital
where my aunt lived My room looked at that time like Doctor
Faustus's Everything in it was in a wild confusion There were huge
closets stuffed full of books which I bought for a song from a
Jewish dealer on the Servanica Footnote The street of the Jews in
Lemberg there were globes atlases flasks charts of the heavens
skeletons of animals skulls the busts of eminent men It looked as
though Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge
green store as a wandering scholiast at any moment

I studied everything in a jumble without system without selection
chemistry alchemy history astronomy philosophy law anatomy and
literature I read Homer Virgil Ossian Schiller Goethe
Shakespeare Cervantes Voltaire Moliere the Koran the Kosmos
Casanova's Memoirs I grew more confused each day more fantastical
more supersensual All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my
imagination Every so and so often she appeared before me like a
vision among my leather-bound books and dead bones lying on a bed of
roses surrounded by cupids Sometimes she appeared gowned like the
Olympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus sometimes in
braids of a rich brown blue-eyes in my aunt's red velvet
kazabaika trimmed with ermine

One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my
imagination in all her smiling beauty I went to see Countess Sobol
who received me in a friendly even cordial manner She gave me a
kiss of welcome which put all my senses in a turmoil She was
probably about forty years old but like most well-preserved women
of the world still very attractive She wore as always her fur-edged
jacket This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten But
nothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was
now discernable

On the contrary there was so little of cruelty in her that without
any more ado she let me adore her

Only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence
and it pleased her to make me happy As for myself I was as happy
as a young god What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her
on my knees and to kiss her hands those with which she had scourged
me What marvellous hands they were of beautiful form delicate
rounded and white with adorable dimples I really was in love with
her hands only I played with them let them submerge and emerge in
the dark fur held them against the light and was unable to satiate
my eyes with them

Wanda involuntarily looked at her hand I noticed it and had to
smile

From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those
days you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I
received from my aunt and about two years later when I paid court
to a young actress only in the roles she played Still later I became
the admirer of a respectable woman She acted the part of
irreproachable virtue only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew
You see it is because I was betrayed sold by a woman who feigned
the strictest principles and the highest ideals that I hate that
sort of poetical sentimental virtue so intensely Give me rather a
woman who is honest enough to say to me I am a Pompadour a Lucretia
Borgia and I am ready to adore her

Wanda rose and opened the window

You have a curious way of arousing one's imagination stimulating
all one's nerves and making one's pulses beat faster You put an
aureole on vice provided only if it is honest Your ideal is a
daring courtesan of genius Oh you are the kind of man who will
corrupt a woman to her very last fiber

                            

In the middle of the night there was a knock at my window I got up
opened it and was startled Without stood Venus in Furs just as
she had appeared to me the first time

You have disturbed me with your stories I have been tossing about
in bed and can't go to sleep she said Now come and stay with me

In a moment

As I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had
kindled a small fire

Autumn is coming she began the nights are really quite cold
already I am afraid you may not like it but I can't put off my furs
until the room is sufficiently warm

Not like it you are joking you know  I threw my arm around her
and kissed her

Of course I know but why this great fondness for furs

I was born with it I replied I already had it as a child
Furthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized
natures This is due both to general and natural laws It is a
physical stimulus which sets you tingling and no one can wholly
escape it Science has recently shown a certain relationship between
electricity and warmth at any rate their effects upon the human
organism are related The torrid zone produces more passionate
characters a heated atmosphere stimulation Likewise with
electricity This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises
such a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect This
is why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom these
adorable scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite
animal of a Mahommed Cardinal Richelieu Crebillon Rousseau
Wieland

A woman wearing furs then cried Wanda is nothing else than a
large cat an augmented electric battery

Certainly I replied That is my explanation of the symbolic
meaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty
Monarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in
this sense for their costume exclusively great painters used it
only for queenly beauty The most beautiful frame which Raphael
could find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the
roseate body of his beloved was dark furs

Thanks for the learned discourse on love said Wanda but you
haven't told me everything You associate something entirely
individual with furs

Certainly I cried I have repeatedly told you that suffering has
a peculiar attraction for me Nothing can intensify my passion more
than tyranny cruelty and especially the faithlessness of a
beautiful woman And I cannot imagine this woman this strange ideal
derived from an aesthetics of ugliness this soul of Nero in the body
of a Phryne except in furs

I understand Wanda interrupted It gives a dominant and imposing
quality to a woman

Not only that I continued You know I am supersensual With me
everything has its roots in the imagination and thence it receives
its nourishment I was already pre-maturely developed and highly
sensitive when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs
fell into my hands I remember reading with a kind of horror which
really was rapture of how they pined in prisons were laid on the
gridiron pierced with arrows boiled in pitch thrown to wild
animals nailed to the cross and suffered the most horrible torment
with a kind of joy To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on
seemed to me exquisite delight especially when it was inflicted by a
beautiful woman for ever since I can remember all poetry and
everything demonic was for me concentrated in woman I literally
carried the idea into a sort of cult

I felt there was something sacred in sex in fact it was the only
sacred thing In woman and her beauty I saw something divine because
the most important function of existence the continuation of the
species is her vocation To me woman represented a personification of
nature Isis and man was her priest her slave In contrast to him
she was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served
her purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it To him her
cruelties even death itself still were sensual raptures

I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the
bridal night and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress
had sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game I
envied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily
ensnared in a forest near Prague and carried to her castle Divin
where after having amused herself a while with him she had him
broken on the wheel 

Disgusting cried Wanda I almost wish you might fall into the
hands of a woman of their savage race In the wolf's skin under the
teeth of the dogs or upon the wheel you would lose the taste for
your kind of poetry

Do you think so I hardly do

Have you actually lost your senses

Possibly But let me go on I developed a perfect passion for
reading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described I
loved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented
them All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne the
inquisitors who had the heretics tortured roasted and butchered
all the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful
beautiful and violent women like Libussa Lucretia Borgia Agnes of
Hungary Queen Margot Isabeau the Sultana Roxolane the Russian
Czarinas of last century all these I saw in furs or in robes
bordered with ermine

And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you said Wanda and
simultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak
coquettishly about her so that the dark shining sable played
beautifully around her bust and arms Well how do you feel now
half broken on the wheel

Her piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking
satisfaction Overcome by desire I flung myself down before her and
threw my arms about her

Yes you have awakened my dearest dream I cried It has slept
long enough

And this is She put her hand on my neck

I was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this
warm little hand and of her regard which tenderly searching fell
upon me through her half-closed lids

To be the slave of a woman a beautiful woman whom I love whom
I worship

And who on that account maltreats you interrupted Wanda laughing

Yes who fetters me and whips me treads me underfoot the while
she gives herself to another

And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of
you to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must
meet him face to face who will turn you over to his absolute mercy
Why not This final tableau doesn't please you so well

I looked at Wanda frightened

You surpass my dreams

Yes we women are inventive she said take heed when you find
your ideal it might easily happen that she will treat you more
cruelly than you anticipate

I am afraid that I have already found my ideal I exclaimed
burying my burning face in her lap

Not I exclaimed Wanda throwing off her furs and moving about the
room laughing She was still laughing as I went downstairs and when
I stood musing in the yard I still heard her peals of laughter above

                            

Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal Wanda asked
archly when we met in the park to-day

At first I could find no answer The most antagonistic emotions were
battling within me In the meantime she sat down on one of the
stone-benches and played with a flower

Well am I

I kneeled down and seized her hands

Once more I beg you to become my wife my true and loyal wife if
you can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal absolutely
without reservation without softness

You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand if
you prove to be the man I am seeking Wanda replied very seriously
but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you
realized your imaginings Well which do you prefer

I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in
your personality

You are mistaken

I believe I continued that you enjoy having a man wholly in
your power torturing him 

No no she exclaimed quickly or perhaps  She pondered

I don't understand myself any longer she continued but I have
a confession to make to you You have corrupted my imagination and
inflamed my blood I am beginning to like the things you speak of
The enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour a Catherine the
Second and all the other selfish frivolous cruel women carries
me away and takes hold of my soul It urges me on to become like those
women who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during
their lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves

You will end by making of me a despot in miniature a domestic
Pompadour

Well then I said in agitation if all this is inherent in you
give way to this trend of your nature Nothing half-way If you can't
be a true and loyal wife to me be a demon

I was nervous from loss of sleep and the proximity of the beautiful
woman affected me like a fever I no longer recall what I said but
I remember that I kissed her feet and finally raised her foot and
put my neck under it She withdrew it quickly and rose almost angrily

If you love me Severin she said quickly and her voice sounded
sharp and commanding never speak to me of those things again
Understand never Otherwise I might really  She smiled and sat
down again

I am entirely serious I exclaimed half-raving I adore you so
infinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you for the
sake of spending my whole life near you

Severin once more I warn you

Your warning is vain Do with me what you will as long as you
don't drive me away

Severin replied Wanda I am a frivolous young woman it is
dangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power You will
end by actually becoming a plaything to me Who will give warrant
that I shall not abuse your insane desire

Your own nobility of character

Power makes people over-bearing

Be it I cried tread me underfoot

Wanda threw her arms around my neck looked into my eyes and shook
her head

I am afraid I can't but I will try for your sake for I love you
Severin as I have loved no other man

                            

To-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl and I had to go shopping
with her She looked at whips long whips with a short handle the
kind that are used on dogs

Are these satisfactory said the shopkeeper

No they are much too small replied Wanda with a side-glance at
me I need a large 

For a bull-dog I suppose opined the merchant

Yes she exclaimed of the kind that are used in Russia for
intractable slaves

She looked further and finally selected a whip at whose sight I
felt a strange creeping sensation

Now good-by Severin she said I have some other purchases to
make but you can't go along

I left her and took a walk On the way back I saw Wanda coming out
at a furrier's She beckoned me

Consider it well she began in good spirits I have never made a
secret of how deeply your serious dreamy character has fascinated
me The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power actually
lying enraptured at my feet of course stimulates me but will this
attraction last Woman loves a man she maltreats a slave and ends
by kicking him aside

Very well then kick me aside I replied when you are tired of
me I want to be your slave

Dangerous forces lie within me said Wanda after we had gone a
few steps further You awaken them and not to your advantage You
know how to paint pleasure cruelty arrogance in glowing colors
What would you say should I try my hand at them and make you the
first object of my experiments I would be like Dionysius who had the
inventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his
wails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox

Perhaps I am a female Dionysius

Be it I exclaimed and my dreams will be fulfilled I am yours
for good or evil choose The destiny that lies concealed within my
breast drives me on demoniacally relentlessly

My Beloved

I do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow and not until evening
the day after tomorrow and then as my slave

Your mistress

Wanda

As my slave was underlined I read the note which I received early
in the morning a second time Then I had a donkey saddled an animal
symbolic of learned professors and rode into the mountains I wanted
to numb my desire my yearning with the magnificent scenery of the
Carpathians I am back tired hungry thirsty and more in love than
ever I quickly change my clothes and a few moments later knock at
her door

Come in

I enter She is standing in the center of the room dressed in a gown
of white satin which floods down her body like light Over it she
wears a scarlet kazabaika richly edged with ermine Upon her
powdered snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds She stands with
her arms folded across her breast and with her brows contracted

Wanda I run toward her and am about to throw my arm about her to
kiss her She retreats a step measuring me from top to bottom

Slave

Mistress I kneel down and kiss the hem of her garment

That is as it should be

Oh how beautiful you are

Do I please you She stepped before the mirror and looked at
herself with proud satisfaction

I shall become mad

Her lower lip twitched derisively and she looked at me mockingly
from behind half-closed lids

Give me the whip

I looked about the room

No she exclaimed stay as you are kneeling She went over to
the fire-place took the whip from the mantle-piece and watching
me with a smile let it hiss through the air then she slowly rolled
up the sleeve of her fur-jacket

Marvellous woman I exclaimed

Silence slave She suddenly scowled looked savage and struck me
with the whip A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me and
pityingly bent down to me Did I hurt you she asked half-shyly
half-timidly

No I replied and even if you had pains that come through you
are a joy Strike again if it gives you pleasure

But it doesn't give me pleasure

Again I was seized with that strange intoxication

Whip me I begged whip me without mercy

Wanda swung the whip and hit me twice Are you satisfied now

No

Seriously no

Whip me I beg you it is a joy to me

Yes because you know very well that it isn't serious she
replied because I haven't the heart to hurt you This brutal game
goes against my grain Were I really the woman who beats her slaves
you would be horrified

No Wanda I replied I love you more than myself I am devoted
to you for death and life In all seriousness you can do with me
whatever you will whatever your caprice suggests

Severin

Tread me underfoot I exclaimed and flung myself face to the
floor before her

I hate all this play-acting said Wanda impatiently

Well then maltreat me seriously

An uncanny pause

Severin I warn you for the last time began Wanda

If you love me be cruel towards me I pleaded with upraised eyes

If I love you repeated Wanda Very well She stepped back and
looked at me with a sombre smile Be then my slave and know what
it means to be delivered into the hands of a woman And at the
same moment she gave me a kick

How do you like that slave

Then she flourished the whip

Get up

I was about to rise

Not that way she commanded on your knees

I obeyed and she began to apply the lash

The blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms Each one
cut into my flesh and burned there but the pains enraptured me They
came from her whom I adored and for whom I was ready at any hour to
lay down my life

She stopped I am beginning to enjoy it she said but enough for
to-day I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far
your strength goes I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and
writhe beneath my whip and in hearing your groans and wails I want
to go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy until you
lose your senses You have awakened dangerous elements in my being
But now get up

I seized her hand to press it to my lips

What impudence

She shoved me away with her foot

Out of my sight slave

                            

After having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams I
awoke Dawn was just beginning to break

How much of what was hovering in my memory was true what had I
actually experienced and what had I dreamed That I had been whipped
was certain I can still feel each blow and count the burning red
stripes on my body And she whipped me Now I know everything

My dream has become truth How does it make me feel Am I
disappointed in the realization of my dream

No I am merely somewhat tired but her cruelty has enraptured me
Oh how I love her adore her All this cannot express in the
remotest way my feeling for her my complete devotion to her What
happiness to be her slave

                            

She calls to me from her balcony I hurry upstairs She is standing
on the threshold holding out her hand in friendly fashion I am
ashamed of myself she says while I embrace her and she hides her
head against my breast

Why

Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday she said with
quivering voice I have fulfilled your mad wish now let us be
reasonable and happy and love each other and in a year I will be
your wife

My mistress I exclaimed and I your slave

Not another word of slavery cruelty or the whip interrupted
Wanda I shall not grant you any of those favors none except
wearing my fur-jacket come and help me into it

                            

The little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his
bolt struck midnight

I rose and wanted to leave

Wanda said nothing but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman
She began to kiss me anew and this silent language was so
comprehensible so convincing 

And it told me more than I dared to understand

A languid abandonment pervaded Wanda's entire being What a
voluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed
eyes in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the
white powder in the red and white satin which crackled about her
with every movement in the swelling ermine of the kazabaika
in which she carelessly nestled

Please I stammered but you will be angry with me

Do with me what you will she whispered

Well then whip me or I shall go mad

Haven't I forbidden you said Wanda sternly but you are
incorrigible

Oh I am so terribly in love I had sunken on my knees and was
burying my glowing face in her lap

I really believe said Wanda thoughtfully that your madness is
nothing but a demonic unsatisfied sensuality Our unnatural way
of life must generate such illnesses Were you less virtuous you
would be completely sane

Well then make me sane I murmured My hands were running through
her hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur which rose
and fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom and drove all
my senses into confusion

And I kissed her No she kissed me savagely pitilessly as if she
wanted to slay me with her kisses I was as in a delirium and had
long since lost my reason but now I too was breathless I sought
to free myself

What is the matter asked Wanda

I am suffering agonies

You are suffering  she broke out into a loud amused laughter

You laugh I moaned have you no idea 

She was serious all of a sudden She raised my head in her hands
and with a violent gesture drew me to her breast

Wanda I stammered

Of course you enjoy suffering she said and laughed again but
wait I'll bring you to your senses

No I will no longer ask I exclaimed whether you want to belong
to me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication I want
to drain my happiness to the full You are mine now and I would
rather lose you than never to have had you

Now you are sensible she said She kissed me again with her
murderous lips I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and
her naked breast surged against mine

Then my senses left me 

The first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping
from my hand and she asked apathetically Did you scratch me

No I believe I have bitten you

                            

It is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as
soon as a new person enters

We spent marvellous days together we visited the mountains and
lakes we read together and I completed Wanda's portrait And how
we loved one another how beautiful her smiling face was

Then a friend of hers arrived a divorced woman somewhat older more
experienced and less scrupulous than Wanda Her influence is already
making itself felt in every direction

Wanda wrinkles her brows and displays a certain impatience with me

Has she ceased loving me

                            

For almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us
Her friend lives with her and we are never alone A circle of men
surrounds the young women With my seriousness and melancholy I am
playing an absurd role as lover Wanda treats me like a stranger

To-day while out walking she staid behind with me I saw that this
was done intentionally and I rejoiced But what did she tell me

My friend doesn't understand how I can love you She doesn't think
you either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise She is
telling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous
life in the capital hinting at the advantages to which I could lay
claim the large parties which I would find there and the
distinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract But of
what use is all this since it happens that I love you

For a moment I lost my breath then I said I have no wish to stand
in the way of your happiness Wanda Do not consider me Then I
raised my hat and let her go ahead She looked at me surprised but
did not answer a syllable

When by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back she
secretly pressed my hand Her glance was so radiant so full of
promised happiness that in a moment all the torments of these days
were forgotten and all their wounds healed

I now am aware again of how much I love her

                            

My friend has complained about you said Wanda to-day

Perhaps she feels that I despise her

But why do you despise her you foolish young man exclaimed
Wanda pulling my ears with both hands

Because she is a hypocrite I said I respect only a woman who is
actually virtuous or who openly lives for pleasure's sake

Like me for instance replied Wanda jestingly but you see
child a woman can only do that in the rarest cases She can neither
be as gaily sensual nor as spiritually free as man her state is
always a mixture of the sensual and spiritual Her heart desires to
enchain man permanently while she herself is ever subject to the
desire for change The result is a conflict and thus usually against
her wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality
and corrupt her character

Certainly that is true I said The transcendental character with
which woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception

But the world likewise demands it Wanda interrupted Look at
this woman She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found
a new admirer here She deceives all three and yet is honored by all
and respected by the world

I don't care I exclaimed but she is to leave you alone she
treats you like an article of commerce

Why not the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously Every woman
has the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions
and much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasure
because if you do it in cold blood you can reap profit to best
advantage

Wanda what are you saying

Why not she said and take note of what I am about to say to you
Never feel secure with the woman you love for there are more
dangers in woman's nature than you imagine Women are neither as
good as their admirers and defenders maintain nor as bad as their
enemies make them out to be Woman's character is characterlessness
The best woman will momentarily go down into the mire and the worst
unexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to
shame those that despise her No woman is so good or so bad but that
at any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the
most divine of the filthiest as well as of the purest thoughts
emotions and actions In spite of all the advances of civilization
woman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature She has the
nature of a savage who is faithful or faithless magnanimous or
cruel according to the impulse that dominates at the moment
Throughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has
produced moral character Man even when he is selfish or evil always
follows principles woman never follows anything but impulses
Don't ever forget that and never feel secure with the woman you
love

                            

Her friend has left At last an evening alone with her again It
seems as if Wanda had saved up all the love which had been kept from
her for this superlative evening never had she been so kind so
near so full of tenderness

What happiness to cling to her lips and to die away in her arms In
a state of relaxation and wholly mine her head rests against my
breast and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other

I cannot yet believe comprehend that this woman is mine wholly
mine

She is right on one point Wanda began without moving without
opening her eyes as if she were asleep

Who

She remained silent

Your friend

She nodded Yes she is right you are not a man you are a
dreamer a charming cavalier and you certainly would be a priceless
slave but I cannot imagine you as husband

I was frightened

What is the matter You are trembling

I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you I replied

Are you made less happy now because of this she replied Does
it rob you of any of your joys that I have belonged to another
before I did to you that others after you will possess me and would
you enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you

Wanda

You see she continued that would be a way out You won't ever
lose me then I care deeply for you and intellectually we are
harmonious and I should like to live with you always if in addition
to you I might have 

What an idea I cried You fill me with a sort of horror

Do you love me any the less

On the contrary

Wanda had raised herself on her left arm I believe she said
that to hold a man permanently it is vitally important not to be
faithful to him What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved
as a hetaira

There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved
woman It is the highest kind of ecstacy

For you too Wanda asked quickly

For me too

And if I should give you that pleasure Wanda exclaimed mockingly

I shall suffer terrible agonies but I shall adore you the more
I replied But you would never deceive me you would have the daemonic
greatness of saying to me I shall love no one but you but I shall
make happy whoever pleases me

Wanda shook her head I don't like deception I am honest but what
man exists who can support the burden of truth Were I say to you
this serene sensual life this paganism is my ideal would you be
strong enough to bear it

Certainly I could endure anything so as not to lose you I feel
how little I really mean to you

But Severin 

But it is so said I and just for that reason 

For that reason you would  she smiled roguishly have I guessed
it

Be your slave I exclaimed Be your unrestricted property
without a will of my own of which you could dispose as you wished
and which would therefore never be a burden to you While you drink
life at its fullness while surrounded by luxury you enjoy the
serene happiness and Olympian love I want to be your servant put
on and take off your shoes

You really aren't so far from wrong replied Wanda for only as
my slave could you endure my loving others Furthermore the freedom
of enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery It
must give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before
one and tremble I want a slave do you hear Severin

Am I not your slave

Then listen to me said Wanda excitedly seizing my hand I want
to be yours as long as I love you

A month

Perhaps even two

And then

Then you become my slave

And you

I Why do you ask I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my
Olympian heights to you softly very softly and secretly

But what does all this mean said Wanda resting her head in both
hands with her gaze lost in the distance a golden fancy which never
can become true An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her
entire being I have never seen her like that

Why unachievable I began

Because slavery doesn't exist any longer

Then we will go to a country where it still exists to the Orient
to Turkey I said eagerly

You would Severin in all seriousness Wanda replied Her eyes
burned

Yes in all seriousness I want to be your slave I continued I
want your power over me to be sanctified by law I want my life to
be in your hands I want nothing that could protect or save me from
you Oh what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent
upon your absolute will your whim at your beck and call And then
what happiness when at some time you deign to be gracious and the
slave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him I knelt
down and leaned my burning forehead against her knee

You are talking as in a fever said Wanda agitatedly and you
really love me so endlessly She held me to her breast and covered
me with kisses

You really want it

I swear to you now by God and my honor that I shall be your slave
wherever and whenever you wish it as soon as you command I
exclaimed hardly master of myself

And if I take you at your word said Wanda

Please do

All this appeals to me she said then It is different from
anything else to know that a man who worships me and whom I love
with all my heart is so wholly mine dependent on my will and
caprice my possession and slave while I 

She looked strangely at me

If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame she
continued It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already but
you have sworn

And I shall keep my oath

I shall see to that she replied I am beginning to enjoy it
and heaven help me we won't stick to fancies now You shall become
my slave and I I shall try to be Venus in Furs

                            

I thought that at last I knew this woman understood her and now I
see I have to begin at the very beginning again Only a little while
ago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile and now she
tries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness

She has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of
honor and agree under oath to be her slave as long as she wishes

With her arm around my neck she reads this unprecedented
incredible document to me The end of each sentence she punctuates
with a kiss

But all the obligations in the contract are on my side I said
teasing her

Of course she replied with great seriousness you cease to be my
lover and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations
towards you You will have to look upon my favors as pure
benevolence You no longer have any rights and no longer can lay
claim to any There can be no limit to my power over you Remember
that you won't be much better than a dog or some inanimate object
You will be mine my plaything which I can break to pieces whenever
I want an hour's amusement You are nothing I am everything Do you
understand She laughed and kissed me again and yet a sort of cold
shiver ran through me

Won't you allow me a few conditions  I began

Conditions She contracted her forehead Ah You are afraid
already or perhaps you regret but it is too late now You have
sworn I have your word of honor But let me hear them

First of all I should like to have it included in our contract
that you will never completely leave me and then that you will never
give me over to the mercies of any of your admirers 

But Severin exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and
with tears in her eyes how can you imagine that I and you a man
who loves me so absolutely who puts himself so entirely in my power 
She halted

No no I said covering her hands with kisses I don't fear
anything from you that might dishonor me Forgive me the ugly
thought

Wanda smiled happily leaned her cheek against mine and seemed to
reflect

You have forgotten something she whispered coquettishly the
most important thing

A condition

Yes that I must always wear my furs exclaimed Wanda But I
promise you I'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic
feeling And I shall be very cruel to you do you understand

Shall I sign the contract I asked

Not yet said Wanda I shall first add your conditions and the
actual signing won't occur until the proper time and place

In Constantinople

No I have thought things over What special value would there be
in owning a slave where everyone owns slaves What I want is to
have a slave I alone here in our civilized sober Philistine
world and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on
account of my beauty and personality not because of law of property
rights or compulsions This attracts me But at any rate we will go
to a country where we are not known and where you can appear before
the world as my servant without embarrassment Perhaps to Italy to
Rome or Naples

                            

We were sitting on Wanda's ottoman She wore her ermine jacket her
hair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back She clung
to my lips drawing my soul from my body My head whirled my blood
began to seethe my heart beat violently against hers

I want to be absolutely in your power Wanda I exclaimed
suddenly seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think
clearly or decide freely I want to put myself absolutely at your
mercy for good or evil without any condition without any limit to
your power

While saying this I had slipped from the ottoman and lay at her
feet looking up at her with drunken eyes

How beautiful you now are she exclaimed your eyes half-broken
in ecstacy fill me with joy carry me away How wonderful your look
would be if you were being beaten to death in the extreme agony You
have the eye of a martyr

                            

Sometimes nevertheless I have an uneasy feeling about placing
myself so absolutely so unconditionally into a woman's hands
Suppose she did abuse my passion her power

Well then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since
my childhood what has always given me the feeling of seductive
terror A foolish apprehension It will be a wanton game she will play
with me nothing more She loves me and she is good a noble
personality incapable of a breach of faith But it lies in her hands
if she wants to she can What a temptation in this doubt this
fear

Now I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier who even
in the pillory while she was another man's mistress still adored
her

Love knows no virtue no profit it loves and forgives and suffers
everything because it must It is not our judgment that leads us
it is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover that
make us abandon ourselves or that repel us

It is a sweet soft enigmatic power that drives us on We cease to
think to feel to will we let ourselves be carried away by it and
ask not whither

                            

A Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade
He aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure
magnificent face and splendid bearing The women particularly gaped
at him as though he were a wild animal but he went his way gloomily
without paying attention to any one He was accompanied by two
servants one a negro completely dressed in red satin and the other
a Circassian in his full gleaming uniform Suddenly he saw Wanda and
fixed his cold piercing look upon her he even turned his head after
her and when she had passed he stood still and followed her with
his eyes

And she she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes and
did everything possible to meet him again

The cunning coquetry with which she walked moved and looked at
him almost stifled me On the way home I remarked about it She knit
her brows

What do you want she said the prince is a man whom I might
like who even dazzles me and I am free I can do what I please 

Don't you love me any longer  I stammered frightened

I love only you she replied but I shall have the prince pay
court to me

Wanda

Aren't you my slave she said calmly Am I not Venus the cruel
northern Venus in Furs

I was silent I felt literally crushed by her words her cold look
entered my heart like a dagger

You will find out immediately the prince's name residence and
circumstances she continued Do you understand

But 

No argument obey exclaimed Wanda more sternly than I would have
thought possible for her and don't dare to enter my sight until you
can answer my questions

It was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired
information for Wanda She let me stand before her like a servant
while she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me smiling
Then she nodded she seemed to be satisfied

Bring me my footstool she commanded shortly

I obeyed and after having put it before her and having put her feet
on it I remained kneeling

How will this end I asked sadly after a short pause

She broke into playful laughter Why things haven't even begun yet

You are more heartless than I imagined I replied hurt

Severin Wanda began earnestly I haven't done anything yet not
the slightest thing and you are already calling me heartless What
will happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization
when I shall lead a gay free life and have a circle of admirers
about me when I shall actually fulfil your ideal tread you
underfoot and apply the lash

You take my dreams too seriously

Too seriously I can't stop at make-believe when once I begin
she replied You know I hate all play-acting and comedy You have
wished it Was it my idea or yours Did I persuade you or did you
inflame my imagination I am taking things seriously now

Wanda I replied caressingly listen quietly to me We love each
other infinitely we are very happy will you sacrifice our entire
future to a whim

It is no longer a whim she exclaimed

What is it I asked frightened

Something that was probably latent in me she said quietly and
thoughtfully Perhaps it would never have come to light if you had
not called it to life and made it grow Now that it has become a
powerful impulse fills my whole being now that I enjoy it now that
I cannot and do not want to do otherwise now you want to back out 
you are you a man

Dear sweet Wanda I began to caress her kiss her

Don't you are not a man 

And you I flared up

I am stubborn she said you know that I haven't a strong
imagination and like you I am weak in execution But when I make up
my mind to do something I carry it through and the more certainly
the more opposition I meet Leave me alone

She pushed me away and got up

Wanda I likewise rose and stood facing her

Now you know what I am she continued Once more I warn you You
still have the choice I am not compelling you to be my slave

Wanda I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes don't
you know how I love you

Her lips quivered contemptuously

You are mistaken you make yourself out worse than you are you are
good and noble by nature 

What do you know about my nature she interrupted vehemently you
will get to know me as I am

Wanda

Decide will you submit unconditionally

And if I say no

Then 

She stepped close up to me cold and contemptuous As she stood
before me now the arms folded across her breast with an evil smile
about her lips she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams Her
expression seemed hard and nothing lay in her eyes that promised
kindness or mercy

Well  she said at last

You are angry I cried you will punish me

Oh no she replied I shall let you go You are free I am not
holding you

Wanda I who love you so 

Yes you my dear sir you who adore me she exclaimed
contemptuously but who are a coward a liar and a breaker of
promises Leave me instantly 

Wanda I 

Wretch

My blood rose in my heart I threw myself down at her feet and began
to cry

Tears too She began to laugh Oh this laughter was frightful
Leave me I don't want to see you again

Oh my God I cried beside myself I will do whatever you
command be your slave a mere object with which you can do what you
will only don't send me away I can't bear it I cannot live without
you I embraced her knees and covered her hand with kisses

Yes you must be a slave and feel the lash for you are not a
man she said calmly She said this to me with perfect composure
not angrily not even excitedly and it was what hurt most Now I
know you your dog-like nature that adores where it is kicked and
the more the more it is maltreated Now I know you and now you
shall come to know me

She walked up and down with long strides while I remained crushed
on my knees my head was hanging supine tears flowed from my eyes

Come here Wanda commanded harshly sitting down on the ottoman
I obeyed her command and sat down beside her She looked at me
sombrely and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior
of her eye Smiling she drew me toward her breast and began to kiss
the tears out of my eyes

                            

The odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily's
park I can escape and don't want to I am ready to endure everything
as soon as she threatens to set me free

                            

If only she would use the whip again There is something uncanny in
the kindness with which she treats me I seem like a little captive
mouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays She is ready at any
moment to tear it to pieces and my heart of a mouse threatens to
burst

What are her intentions What does she purpose to do with me

                            

It seems she has completely forgotten the contract my slavehood Or
was it actually only stubbornness And she gave up her whole plan as
soon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim

How kind she is to me how tender how loving We are spending
marvellously happy days

To-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and
Mephistopheles in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar
Her glance hung on me with strange pleasure

I don't understand she said when I had finished how a man who
can read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression and
interpret them so clearly concisely and intelligently can at the
same time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are

Were you pleased said I and kissed her forehead

She gently stroked my brow I love you Severin she whispered I
don't believe I could ever love any one more than you Let us be
sensible what do you say

Instead of replying I folded her in my arms a deep inward yet
vaguely sad happiness filled my breast my eyes grew moist and a
tear fell upon her hand

How can you cry she exclaimed you are a child

                            

On a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage He
seemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda's side and
looked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his
electric gray eyes She however did not seem to notice him I felt
at that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet
She let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an
inanimate object a tree for instance and turned to me with her
gracious smile

                            

When I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly
unaccountably distracted and moody What was occupying her

I am sorry you are going she said when I was already standing on
the threshold

It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my
trial to cease tormenting me  I pleaded

Do you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me too
Wanda interjected

Then end it I exclaimed embracing her be my wife

Never Severin she said gently but with great firmness

What do you mean

I was frightened in my innermost soul

You are not the man for me

I looked at her and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about
her waist then I left the room and she she did not call me back

                            

A sleepless night I made countless decisions only to toss them
aside again In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared
our relationship dissolved My hand trembled when I put on the seal
and I burned my fingers

As I went upstairs to hand it to the maid my knees threatened to
give way

The door opened and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers

I haven't had my hair dressed yet she said smiling What have
you there

A letter 

For me

I nodded

Ah you want to break with me she exclaimed mockingly

Didn't you tell me yesterday that I wasn't the man for you

I repeat it now

Very well then My whole body was trembling my voice failed me
and I handed her the letter

Keep it she said measuring me coldly You forget that is no
longer a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man as a slave
you will doubtless do well enough

Madame I exclaimed aghast

That is what you will call me in the future replied Wanda
throwing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt Put
your affairs in order within the next twenty-four hours The day
after to-morrow I shall start for Italy and you will accompany me
as my servant

Wanda 

I forbid any sort of familiarity she said cutting my words short
likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you and
you are not to speak to me until you are spoken to From now on your
name is no longer Severin but Gregor

I trembled with rage and yet unfortunately I cannot deny it I
also felt a strange pleasure and stimulation

But madame you know my circumstances I began in my confusion
I am dependent on my father and I doubt whether he will give me the
large sum of money needed for this journey 

That means you have no money Gregor said Wanda delightedly so
much the better you are then entirely dependent on me and in fact
my slave

You don't consider I tried to object that as man of honor it is
impossible for me 

I have indeed considered it she replied almost with a tone of
command As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your
promise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey
whatever I command Now leave me Gregor

I turned toward the door

Not yet you may first kiss my hand She held it out to me with a
certain proud indifference and I the dilettante the donkey the
miserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips
which were dry and hot with excitement

There was another gracious nod of the head

Then I was dismissed

                            

Though it was late in the evening my light was still lit and a fire
was burning in the large green stove There were still many things
among my letters and documents to be put in order Autumn as is
usually the case with us had fallen with all its power

Suddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip

I opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and
in a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great
Catherine favored

Are you ready Gregor she asked darkly

Not yet mistress I replied

I like that word she said then you are always to call me
mistress do you understand We leave here to-morrow morning at nine
o'clock As far as the district capital you will be my companion and
friend but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are
my slave my servant Now close the window and open the door

After I had done as she had demanded and after she had entered she
asked contracting her brows ironically well how do you like me

Wanda you 

Who gave you permission She gave me a blow with the whip

You are very beautiful mistress

Wanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair Kneel down here beside
my chair

I obeyed

Kiss my hand

I seized her small cold hand and kissed it

And the mouth 

In a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel
woman and covered her face arms and breast with glowing kisses
She returned them with equal fervor the eyelids closed as in a
dream It was after midnight when she left

                            

At nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure
as she had ordered We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a
comfortable light carriage The most interesting drama of my life had
reached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible
to foretell

So far everything went well I sat beside Wanda and she chatted
very graciously and intelligently with me as with a good friend
concerning Italy Pisemski's new novel and Wagner's music She wore
a sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short
jacket of the same material set with dark fur It fitted closely and
showed her figure to best advantage Over it she wore dark furs Her
hair wound into an antique knot lay beneath a small dark fur-hat
from which a black veil hung Wanda was in very good humor she fed
me candies played with my hair loosened my neck cloth and made a
pretty cockade of it she covered my knees with her furs and
stealthily pressed the fingers of my hand When our Jewish driver
persistently went on nodding to himself she even gave me a kiss and
her cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal
rose which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and
upon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice

                            

We are at the district capital We get out at the railway station
Wanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm and goes
to secure the tickets

When she returns she has completely changed

Here is your ticket Gregor she says in a tone which supercilious
ladies use to their servants

A third-class ticket I reply with comic horror

Of course she continues but now be careful You won't get on
until I am settled in my compartment and don't need you any longer
At each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders Don't
forget And now give me my furs

After I had helped her into them humbly like a slave she went to
find an empty first-class coupe I followed Supporting herself on
my shoulder she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed
them on the warming bottle

Then she nodded to me and dismissed me I slowly ascended a third-class
carriage which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed
like the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades I now had the leisure
to muse about the riddle of human existence and about its greatest
riddle of all woman

                            

Whenever the train stops I jump off run to her carriage and with
drawn cap await her orders She wants coffee and then a glass of
water at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands and
thus it goes on She lets several men who have entered her
compartment pay court to her I am dying of jealousy and have to leap
about like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and
not miss the train

In this way the night passes I haven't had time to eat a mouthful
and I can't sleep I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish
peasants Jewish peddlers and common soldiers

When I mount the steps of her coupe she is lying stretched out
on cushions in her comfortable furs covered up with the skins of
animals She is like an oriental despot and the men sit like Indian
deities straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to
breathe

                            

She stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping and particularly
to buy series of luxurious gowns She continues to treat me as her
servant I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces She
hands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look
and laden down like a donkey I pant along behind

Before leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel
waiters I am ordered to put on her livery It is a Cracovian costume
in her colors light-blue with red facings and red quadrangular cap
ornamented with peacock-feathers The costume is rather becoming to
me

The silver buttons bear her coat of arms I have the feeling of having
been sold or of having bonded myself to the devil My fair demon leads
me from Vienna to Florence Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and
greasy-haired Jews my companions now are curly-haired Contadini a
magnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers and a poor German
painter The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions but of salami and
cheese

Night has fallen again I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack my arms and
legs seem broken But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the
affair The stars sparkle round about the Italian sergeant has a face
like Apollo Belvedere and the German painter sings a lovely German
song

Now that all the shadows gather
And endless stars grow light
Deep yearning on me falls
And softly fills the night

Through the sea of dreams
Sailing without cease
Sailing goes my soul
In thine to find release

And I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal
comfort among her soft furs

                            

Florence Crowds cries importunate porters and cab-drivers Wanda
chooses a carriage and dismisses the porters

What have I a servant for she says Gregor here is the ticket 
get the luggage

She wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I
drag the heavy trunks hither one after another I break down for a
moment under the last one a good-natured carabiniere with an
intelligent face comes to my assistance She laughs

It must be heavy said she all my furs are in it

I get up on the driver's seat wiping drops of perspiration from my
brow She gives the name of the hotel and the driver urges on his
horse In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated
entrance

Have you any rooms she asks the portier

Yes madame

Two for me one for my servant all with stoves

Two first-class rooms for you madame both with stoves replied
the waiter who had hastily come up and one without heat for your
servant

She looked at them and then abruptly said they are satisfactory
have fires built at once my servant can sleep in the unheated room

I merely looked at her

Bring up the trunks Gregor she commands paying no attention to
my looks In the meantime I'll be dressing and then will go down
to the dining-room and you can eat something for supper

As she goes into the adjoining room I drag the trunks upstairs and
help the waiter build a fire in her bed-room He tries to question
me in bad French about my employer With a brief glance I see the
blazing fire the fragrant white poster-bed and the rugs which cover
the floor Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs and ask for
something to eat A good-natured waiter who used to be in the
Austrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German
shows me the dining-room and waits on me I have just had the first
fresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on
my fork when she enters

I rise

What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my
servant is eating she snaps at the waiter flaring with anger She
turns around and leaves

Meanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating Later
I climb the four flights upstairs to my room My small trunk is
already there and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning It is a
narrow room without fire-place without a window but with a small
air-hole If it weren't so beastly cold it would remind me of one
of the Venetian piombi Footnote These were notorious prisons
under the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges Involuntarily I
have to laugh out aloud so that it re-echoes and I am startled by
my own laughter

Suddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical
Italian gesture calls You are to come down to madame at once I
pick up my cap stumble down the first few steps but finally arrive
in front of her door on the first floor and knock

Come in

I enter shut the door and stand attention

Wanda has made herself comfortable She is sitting in a neglige of
white muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a
footstool that matches She has thrown her fur-cloak about her It
is the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time
as goddess of love

The yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections
their reflections in the large mirrors and the red flames from the
open fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet the dark-brown
sable of the cloak the smooth white skin and the red flaming hair
of the beautiful woman Her clear but cold face is turned toward me
and her cold green eyes rest upon me

I am satisfied with you Gregor she began

I bowed

Come closer

I obeyed

Still closer she looked down and stroked the sable with her
hand Venus in Furs receives her slave I can see that you are more
than an ordinary dreamer you don't remain far in arrears of your
dreams you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into
effect no matter how mad they are I confess I like this it
impresses me There is strength in this and strength is the only
thing one respects I actually believe that under unusual
circumstances in a period of great deeds what seems to be your
weakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power Under the early
emperors you would have been a martyr at the time of the Reformation
an anabaptist during the French Revolution one of those inspired
Girondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their
lips But you are my slave my 

She suddenly leaped up the furs slipped down and she threw her
arms with soft pressure about my neck

My beloved slave Severin oh how I love you how I adore you how
handsome you are in your Cracovian costume You will be cold to-night
up in your wretched room without a fire Shall I give you one of my
furs dear heart the large one there 

She quickly picked it up throwing it over my shoulders and before
I knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it

How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face they bring out your
noble lines As soon as you cease being my slave you must wear a
velvet coat with sable do you understand Otherwise I shall never
put on my fur-jacket again

And again she began to caress me and kiss me finally she drew me
down on the little divan

You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs she said Quick
quick give them to me or I will lose all sense of dignity

I placed the furs about her and Wanda slipped her right arm into
the sleeve

This is the pose in Titian's picture But now enough of joking
Don't always look so solemn it makes me feel sad As far as the
world is concerned you are still merely my servant you are not yet
my slave for you have not yet signed the contract You are still
free and can leave me any moment You have played your part
magnificently I have been delighted but aren't you tired of it
already and don't you think I am abominable Well say something I
command it

Must I confess to you Wanda I began

Yes you must

Even it you take advantage of it I continued I shall love you
the more deeply adore you the more fanatically the worse you treat
me What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my
senses I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her
moist lips

Oh you beautiful woman I then exclaimed looking at her In my
enthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth
against her neck

You love me even when I am cruel said Wanda now go you bore
me don't you hear

She boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears

Help me into my furs slave

I helped her as well as I could

How awkward she exclaimed and was scarcely in it before she
struck me in the face again I felt myself growing pale

Did I hurt you she asked softly touching me with her hand

No no I exclaimed

At any rate you have no reason to complain you want it thus now
kiss me again

I threw my arms about her and her lips clung closely to mine As
she lay against my breast in her large heavy furs I had a curiously
oppressive sensation It was as if a wild beast a she-bear were
embracing me It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my
flesh But this time the she-bear let me off easily

With my heart filled with smiling hopes I went up to my miserable
servant's room and threw myself down on my hard couch

Life is really amazingly droll I thought A short time ago the
most beautiful woman Venus herself rested against your breast and
now you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell Unlike us
they don't hurl the damned into flames but they have devils chasing
them out into fields of ice

Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated
rooms

                            

During the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream I had
been dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way I had been
looking in vain for a way out Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a
sleigh harnessed with reindeer he had the face of the waiter who had
shown me to the unheated room

What are you looking for here my dear sir he exclaimed This is
the North Pole

A moment later he had disappeared and Wanda flew over the smooth
ice on tiny skates Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled the
ermine of her jacket and cap but especially her face gleamed whiter
than the snow She shot toward me inclosed me in her arms and began
to kiss me Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side

What are you doing I asked horror-stricken

She laughed and as I looked at her now it was no longer Wanda but
a huge white she-bear who was digging her paws into my body

I cried out in despair and still heard her diabolical laughter when
I awoke and looked about the room in surprise

Early in the morning I stood at Wanda's door and the waiter brought
the coffee I took it from him and served it to my beautiful
mistress She had already dressed and looked magnificent all fresh
and roseate She smiled graciously at me and called me back when I
was about to withdraw respectfully

Come Gregor have your breakfast quickly too she said then we
will go house-hunting I don't want to stay in the hotel any longer
than I have to It is very embarassing here If I chat with you for
more than a minute people will immediately sayThe fair Russian
is having an affair with her servant you see the race of Catherines
isn't extinct yet'

Half an hour later we went out Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the
Russian cap and I in my Cracovian costume We created quite a stir I
walked about ten paces behind looking very solemn but expected
momentarily to have to break out into loud laughter There was scarcely
a street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear
the sign camere ammobiliate Wanda always sent me upstairs and only
when the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself
ascend By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt

We entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable
habitation Wanda was already somewhat out of humor Suddenly she said
to me Severin the seriousness with which you play your part is
charming and the restrictions which we have placed upon each other are
really annoying me I can't stand it any longer I do love you I must
kiss you Let's go into one of the houses

But my lady  I interposed

Gregor She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few
steps of the dark stair-way then she threw her arms about me with
passionate tenderness and kissed me

Oh Severin you were very wise You are much more dangerous as
slave than I would have imagined you are positively irrestible and
I am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again

Don't you love me any longer then I asked seized by a sudden
fright

She solemnly shook her head but kissed me again with her swelling
adorable lips

We returned to the hotel Wanda had luncheon and ordered me also
quickly to get something to eat

Of course I wasn't served as quickly as she and so it happened
that just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth
the waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture
Madame wants you at once

I took a rapid and painful leave of my food and tired and hungry
hurried toward Wanda who was already on the street

I wouldn't have imagined you could be so cruel I said
reproachfully With all these fatiguing duties you don't even leave
me time to eat in peace

Wanda laughed gaily I thought you had finished she said but
never mind Man was born to suffer and you in particular The
martyrs didn't have any beefsteaks either

I followed her resentfully gnawing at my hunger

I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city Wanda
continued It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is
shut off and where you can do as you please In such a strange mad
relationship as ours there must be no jarring note I shall rent an
entire villa and you will be surprised You have my permission now
to satisfy your hunger and look about a bit in Florence I won't be
home till evening If I need you then I will have you called

I looked at the Duomo the Palazzo Vecchio the Logia di Lanzi and
then I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno Again and
again I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence whose
round cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue
cloudless sky I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide
arches the lively waves of the beautiful yellow river ran and the
green hills which surrounded the city bearing slender cypresses and
extensive buildings palaces and monasteries

It is a different world this one in which we are a gay sensuous
smiling world The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and
somberness of ours It is a long ways off to the last white villas
scattered among the pale green of the mountains and yet there isn't
a spot that isn't bright with sunlight The people are less serious
than we perhaps they think less but they all look as though they
were happy

It is also maintained that death is easier in the South

I have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn
and love of the senses without torment does exist

Wanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the
winter It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the
Arno opposite the Cascine It is surrounded by an attractive garden
with lovely paths grass plots and magnificent meadow of camelias
It is only two stories high quadrangular in the Italian fashion An
open gallery runs along one side a sort of loggia with plaster-casts
of antique statues stone steps lead from it down into the garden
From the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin
from which winding stairs lead to my mistressbed-chamber

Wanda occupies the second story by herself

A room on the ground floor has been assigned to me it is very
attractive and even has a fireplace

I have roamed through the garden On a round hillock I discovered a
little temple but I found its door locked However there is a chink
in the door and when I glue my eye to it I see the goddess of love
on a white pedestal

A slight shudder passes over me It seems to me as if she were
smiling at me saying Are you there I have been expecting you

                            

It is evening An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before
my mistress I ascend the wide marble stairs pass through the
anteroom a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence and
knock at the door of the bedroom I knock very softly for the luxury
displayed everywhere intimidates me Consequently no one hears me
and I stand for some time in front of the door I have a feeling as
if I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine and
it seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping
furs with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast and with
her little white powdered curls

I knocked again Wanda impatiently pulls the door open

Why so late she asks

I was standing in front of the door but you didn't hear me knock
I reply timidly She closes the door and clinging to me she leads
me to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting The
entire arrangement of the room is in red damask wall-paper
curtains portieres hangings of the bed A magnificent painting of
Samson and Delilah forms the ceiling

Wanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille Her white satin
dress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body
leaving her arms and breast bare and carelessly they nestle amid the
dark hair of the great fur of sable lined with green velvet Her red
hair falls down her back as far as the hips only half held by
strings of black pearls

Venus in Furs I whisper while she draws me to her breast and
threatens to stifle me with her kisses Then I no longer speak and
neither do I think everything is drowned out in an ocean of
unimagined bliss

Do you still love me she asks her eye softening in passionate
tenderness

You ask I exclaimed

You still remember your oath she continued with an alluring
smile now that everything is prepared everything in readiness I
ask you once more is it still your serious wish to become my slave

Am I not ready I asked in surprise

You have not yet signed the papers

Papers what papers

Oh I see you want to give it up she said well then we will
let it go

But Wanda I said you know that nothing gives me greater
happiness than to serve you to be your slave I would give
everything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power even
unto death 

How beautiful you are she whispered when you speak so
enthusiastically so passionately I am more in love with you than
ever and you want me to be dominant stern and cruel I am afraid
it will be impossible for me to be so

I am not afraid I replied smiling where are the papers'

So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power I
have drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have
decided to kill yourself In that way I can even kill you if I so
desire

Give them to me

While I was unfolding the documents and reading them Wanda got pen
and ink She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck and
looked over my shoulder at the paper

The first one read

AGREEMENT BETWEEN MME VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI

Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced
of Mme Wanda von Dunajew and renounces all the rights appertaining
thereunto he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a
man and nobleman that hereafter he will be her slave until such
time that she herself sets him at liberty again

As the slave of Mme von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor and
he is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes and to
obey every one of her commands he is always to be submissive to his
mistress and is to consider her every sign of favor as an
extraordinary mercy

Mme von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she
deems best even for the slightest inadvertence or fault but also
is herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her
or merely for the sake of whiling away the time Should she so desire
she may kill him whenever she wishes in short he is her
unrestricted property

Should Mme von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty Severin von
Kusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or
suffered as her slave and promises never under any circumstances and
in no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation

Mme von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as
often as possible in her furs especially when she purposes some
cruelty toward her slave

Appended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present
day

The second document contained only a few words

Having since many years become weary of existence and its
illusions I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless
life

I was seized with a deep horror when I had finished There was still
time I could still withdraw but the madness of passion and the
sight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder
carried me away

This one you will have to copy Severin said Wanda indicating
the second document It has to be entirely in your own handwriting
this of course isn't necessary in the case of the agreement

I quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a
suicide and handed them to Wanda She read them and put them on the
table with a smile

Now have you the courage to sign it she asked with a crafty
smile inclining her head

I took the pen

Let me sign first said Wanda your hand is trembling are you
afraid of the happiness that is to be yours

She took the agreement and pen While engaging in my internal struggle
I looked upward for a moment It occurred to me that the painting on the
ceiling like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools was
utterly unhistorical but this very fact gave it a strange mood which
had an almost uncanny effect on me Delilah an opulent woman with
flaming red hair lay extended half-disrobed in a dark fur-cloak upon
a red ottoman and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and
bound by the Philistines Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of
a diabolical cruelty her eyes half-closed met Samson's and his with
a last look of insane passion cling to hers for already one of his
enemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him

Now  said Wanda Why you are all lost in thought What is the
matter with you everything will remain just as it was even after
you have signed don't you know me yet dear heart

I looked at the agreement Her name was written there in bold
letters I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic
then I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement

You are trembling said Wanda calmly shall I help you

She gently took hold of my hand and my name appeared at the bottom
of the second paper Wanda looked once more at the two documents and
then locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman

Now then give me your passport and money

I took out my wallet and handed it to her She inspected it nodded
and put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled
before her leaning my head against her breast

Suddenly she thrusts me away with her foot leaps up and pulls the
bell-rope In answer to its sound three young slender negresses
enter they are as if carved of ebony and are dressed from head to
foot in red satin each one has a rope in her hand

Suddenly I realize my position and am about to rise Wanda stands
proudly erect her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and
contemptous eyes is turned toward me She stands before me as
mistress commanding gives a sign with her hand and before I really
know what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the
ground and have tied me hand and foot As in the case of one about
to be executed my arms are bound behind my back so that I can
scarcely move

Give me the whip Haydee commands Wanda with unearthly calm

The negress hands it to her mistress kneeling

And now take off my heavy furs she continues they impede me

The negress obeyed

The jacket there Wanda commanded

Haydee quickly brought her the kazabaika set with ermine which lay
on the bed and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful
movements

Now tie him to the pillar here

The negresses lifted me up and twisting a heavy rope around my
body tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which
supported the top of the wide Italian bed

Then they suddenly disappeared as if the earth had swallowed them

Wanda swiftly approached me Her white satin dress flowed behind her
in a long train like silver like moonlight her hair flared like
flames against the white fur of her jacket Now she stood in front
of me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips in her right hand
she held the whip She uttered an abrupt laugh

Now play has come to an end between us she said with heartless
coldness Now we will begin in dead earnest You fool I laugh at you
and despise you you who in your insane infatuation have given
yourself as a plaything to me the frivolous and capricious woman
You are no longer the man I love but my slave at my mercy even
unto life and death

You shall know me

First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness
without having done anything to deserve it so that you may
understand what to expect if you are awkward disobedient or
refractory

With a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve and struck
me across the back

I winced for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh

Well how do you like that she exclaimed

I was silent

Just wait you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip she
threatened and simultaneously began to strike me again

The blows fell quickly in rapid succession with terrific force
upon my back arms and neck I had to grit my teeth not to scream
aloud Now she struck me in the face warm blood ran down but she
laughed and continued her blows

It is only now I understand you she exclaimed It really is a
joy to have some one so completely in one's power and a man at that
who loves you you do love me No Oh I'll tear you to shreds yet
and with each blow my pleasure will grow Now twist like a worm
scream whine You will find no mercy in me

Finally she seemed tired

She tossed the whip aside stretched out on the ottoman and rang

The negresses entered

Untie him

As they loosened the rope I fell to the floor like a lump of wood
The black women grinned showing their white teeth

Untie the rope around his feet

They did it but I was unable to rise

Come over here Gregor

I approached the beautiful woman Never did she seem more seductive
to me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt

One step further Wanda commanded Now kneel down and kiss my
foot

She extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin and I the
supersensual fool pressed my lips upon it

Now you won't lay eyes on me for an entire month Gregor she
said seriously I want to become a stranger to you so you will more
easily adjust yourself to our new relationship In the meantime you
will work in the garden and await my orders Now off with you
slave

                            

A month has passed with monotonous regularity heavy work and a
melancholy hunger hunger for her who is inflicting all these
torments on me

I am under the gardener's orders I help him lop the trees and prune
the hedges transplant flowers turn over the flower beds sweep the
gravel paths I share his coarse food and his hard cot I rise and
go to bed with the chickens Now and then I hear that our mistress
is amusing herself surrounded by admirers Once I heard her gay
laughter even down here in the garden

I seem awfully stupid to myself Was it the result of my present
life or was I so before The month is drawing to a close the day
after to-morrow What will she do with me now or has she forgotten
me and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day

A written order

The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service

Wanda Dunajew

With a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the
following morning and enter the bed-room of my divinity It is still
filled with a pleasant half darkness

Is it you Gregor she asks while I kneel before the fire-place
building a fire I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice I
cannot see her herself she is invisible behind the curtains of the
four-poster bed

Yes my mistress I reply

How late is it

Past nine o'clock

Breakfast

I hasten to get it and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed

Here is breakfast my mistress

Wanda draws back the curtains and curiously enough at the first
glance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair
she seems an absolute stranger a beautiful woman but the beloved
soft lines are gone This face is hard and has an expression of
weariness and satiety

Or is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this

She fixes her green eyes upon me more with curiosity than with
menace perhaps even somewhat pityingly and lazily pulls the dark
sleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder

At this moment she is very charming very maddening and I feel my
blood rising to my head and heart The tray in my hands begins to
sway She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on
the toilet-table

You are awkward slave she says furrowing her brow

I lower my looks to the ground and hold the tray as steadily as
possible She eats her breakfast yawns and stretches her opulent
limbs in the magnificent furs

She has rung I enter

Take this letter to Prince Corsini

I hurry into the city and hand the letter to the Prince He is a
handsome young man with glowing black eyes Consumed with jealousy
I take his answer to her

What is the matter with you she asks with lurking spitefulness
You are very pale

Nothing mistress I merely walked rather fast

At luncheon the prince is at her side and I am condemned to serve
both her and him They joke and I am as if non-existent for both
For a brief moment I see black I was just pouring some Bordeaux into
his glass and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown

How awkward Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face The prince
laughed and she also but I felt the blood rising to my face

After luncheon she drove in the Cascine She has a little carriage
with a handsome brown English horse and holds the reins herself
I sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts and nods with a
smile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her

As I help her out of the carriage she leans lightly on my arm the
contact runs through me like an electric shock She is a wonderful
woman and I love her more than ever

                            

For dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women I
serve but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth

A slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures It makes you
understand very quickly especially when the instruction is by the
way of a small woman's hand

                            

After dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater As she descends the
stairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and
with a diadem of white roses on her hair she is literally stunning
I open the carriage-door and help her in In front of the theater
I leap from the driver's seat and in alighting she leaned on my arm
which trembled under the sweet burden I open the door of her box
and then wait in the vestibule The performance lasts four hours she
receives visits from her cavaliers the while I grit my teeth with
rage

It is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the
last time

Fire she orders abruptly and when the fire-place crackles Tea

When I return with the samovar she has already undressed and with
the aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee

Haydee thereupon leaves

Hand me the sleeping-furs says Wanda sleepily stretching her
lovely limbs I take them from the arm-chair and hold them while she
slowly and lazily slides into the sleeves She then throws herself
down on the cushions of the ottoman

Take off my shoes and put on my velvet slippers

I kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts
Hurry hurry Wanda exclaims you are hurting me just you wait I
will teach you She strikes me with the whip but now the shoe is
off

Now get out Still a kick and then I can go to bed

                            

To-night I accompanied her to a soiree In the entrance-hall she
ordered me to help her out of her furs then with a proud smile
confident of victory she entered the brilliantly illuminated room
I again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts watching hour after
hour run by From time to time the sounds of music reached me when
the door remained open for a moment Several servants tried to start
a conversation with me but soon desisted since I knew only a few
words of Italian

Finally I fell asleep and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a
violent attack of jealousy I was condemned to death and saw myself
strapped on the board the knife fell I felt it on my neck but I
was still alive 

Then the executioner slapped my face

No it wasn't the executioner it was Wanda who stood wrathfully
before me demanding her furs I am at her side in a moment and help
her on with it

There is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs and
in seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in
the precious soft furs and to lift the flowing hair over the collar
When she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her
body still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable It is enough to
drive one mad

                            

Finally a day came when there were neither guests nor theater nor
other company I breathed a sigh of relief Wanda sat in the gallery
reading and apparently had no orders for me At dusk when the
silvery evening mists fell she withdrew I served her at dinner she
ate by herself but had not a look not a syllable for me not even
a slap in the face

I actually desire a slap from her hand Tears fill my eyes and I
feel that she has humiliated me so deeply that she doesn't even find
it worth while to torture or maltreat me any further

Before she goes to bed her bell calls me

You will sleep here to-night I had horrible dreams last night and
am afraid of being alone Take one of the cushions from the ottoman
and lie down on the bearskin at my feet

Then Wanda put out the lights The only illumination in the room was
from a small lamp suspended from the ceiling She herself got into
bed Don't stir so as not to wake me

I did as she had commanded but could not fall asleep for a long
time I saw the beautiful woman beautiful as a goddess lying on her
back on the dark sleeping-furs her arms beneath her neck with a
flood of red hair over them I heard her magnificent breast rise in
deep regular breathing and whenever she moved ever so slightly I
woke up and listened to see whether she needed me

But she did not require me

No task was required of me I meant no more to her than a night-lamp or
a revolver which one places under one's pillow

                            

Am I mad or is she Does all this arise out of an inventive wanton
woman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual
fantasies or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters
who take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot like a worm
human beings who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs

What have I experienced

When I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed Wanda suddenly
placed her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine

What beautiful eyes you have she said softly and especially now
since you suffer Are you very unhappy

I bowed my head and kept silent

Severin do you still love me she suddenly exclaimed
passionately can you still love me

She drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset
the can and cups fell to the floor and the coffee ran over the
carpet

Wanda my Wanda I cried out and held her passionately against me
I covered her mouth face and breast with kisses

It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse
you treat me the more frequently you betray me Oh I shall die of
pain and love and jealousy

But I haven't betrayed you as yet Severin replied Wanda smiling

Not Wanda Don't jest so mercilessly with me I cried Haven't
I myself taken the letter to the Prince 

Of course it was an invitation for luncheon

You have since we have been in Florence 

I have been absolutely faithful to you replied Wanda I swear it
by all that is holy to me All that I have done was merely to fulfill
your dream and it was done for your sake

However I shall take a lover otherwise things will be only half
accomplished and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having
treated you cruelly enough my dear beautiful slave But to-day you
shall be Severin again the only one I love I haven't given away
your clothes They are here in the chest Go and dress as you used
to in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate
Forget everything that has happened since oh you will forget it
easily in my arms I shall kiss away all your sorrows

She began to treat me tenderly like a child to kiss me and caress
me Finally she said with a gracious smile Go now and dress I too
will dress Shall I put on my fur-jacket Oh yes I know now run
along

When I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her
white satin dress and the red kazabaika edged with ermine her hair
was white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond
diadem For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine
the Second but she did not give me much time for reminiscences She
drew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful
hours She was no longer the stern capricious mistress she was
entirely a fine lady a tender sweetheart She showed me photographs
and books which had just appeared and talked about them with so much
intelligence clarity and good taste that I more than once carried
her hand to my lips enraptured She then had me recite several of
Lermontov's poems and when I was all afire with enthusiasm she
placed her small hand gently on mine Her expression was soft and her
eyes were filled with tender pleasure

Are you happy

Not yet

She then leaned back on the cushions and slowly opened her
kazabaika

But I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine
You are driving me mad I stammered

Come

I was already lying in her arms and like a serpent she was kissing
me with her tongue when again she whispered Are you happy

Infinitely I exclaimed

She laughed aloud It was an evil shrill laugh which made cold
shivers run down by back

You used to dream of being the slave the plaything of a beautiful
woman and now you imagine you are a free human being a man my
lover-you fool A sign from me and you are a slave again Down on
your knees

I sank down from the ottoman to her feet but my eye still clung
doubtingly on hers

You can't believe it she said looking at me with her arms folded
across her breast I am bored and you will just do to while away
a couple of hours of time Don't look at me that way 

She kicked me with her foot

You are just what I want a human being a thing an animal 

She rang The three negresses entered

Tie his hands behind his back

I remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this They led me
into the garden down to the little vineyard which forms the
southern boundary Corn had been planted between the espaliers and
here and there a few dead stalks still stood To one side was a
plough

The negresses tied me to a post and amused themselves sticking me
with their golden hair-needles But this did not last long before
Wanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head and with her hands
in the pockets of her jacket She had me untied and then my hands
were fastened together on my back She finally had a yoke put around
my neck and harnessed me to the plough

Then her black demons drove me out into the field One of them held
the plough the other one led me by a line the third applied the
whip and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on

                            

When I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said Bring
another cover I want you to dine with me to-day and when I was
about to sit down opposite her she added No over here close by
my side

She is in the best of humors gives me soup with her spoon feeds me
with her fork and places her head on the table like a playful kitten
and flirts with me I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee who
serves in my place perhaps a little longer than is necessary It is
only now that I noticed her noble almost European cast of
countenance and her magnificent statuesque bust which is as if hewn
out of black marble The black devil observes that she pleases me
and grinning shows her teeth She has hardly left the room before
Wanda leaps up in a rage

What you dare to look at another woman besides me Perhaps you
like her even better than you do me she is even more demonic

I am frightened I have never seen her like this before she is
suddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles Venus in
Furs is jealous of her slave She snatches the whip from its hook and
strikes me in the face then she calls her black servants who bind
me and carry me down into the cellar where they throw me into a
dark dank subterranean compartment a veritable prison-cell

Then the lock of the door clicks the bolts are drawn a key sings
in the lock I am a prisoner buried

I have been lying here for I don't know how long bound like a calf
about to be hauled to the slaughter on a bundle of damp straw
without any light without food without drink without sleep It
would be like her to let me starve to death if I don't freeze to
death before then I am shaking with cold Or is it fever I believe
I am beginning to hate this woman

                            

A red streak like blood floods across the floor it is a light
falling through the door which is now thrust open

Wanda appears on the threshold wrapped in her sables holding a
lighted torch

Are you still alive she asks

Are you coming to kill me I reply with a low hoarse voice

With two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side she kneels down beside
me and places my head in her lap Are you ill Your eyes glow so
do you love me I want you to love me

She draws forth a short dagger I start with fright when its blade
gleams in front of my eyes I actually believe that she is about to
kill me She laughs and cuts the ropes that bind me

                            

Every evening after dinner she now has me called I have to read to
her and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and
subjects She seems entirely transformed it is as if she were
ashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty
with which she treated me A touching gentleness transfigures her
entire being and when at the good-night she gives me her hand a
superhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes of the kind
which calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the
miseries of existence and all the terrors of death

                            

I am reading Manon l'Escault to her She feels the association she
doesn't say a word but she smiles from time to time and finally she
shuts up the little book

Don't you want to go on reading

Not to-day We will ourselves act Manon l'Escault to-day I have a
rendezvous in the Cascine and you my dear Chevalier will accompany
me I know you will do it won't you

You command it

I do not command it I beg it of you she says with irresistible
charm She then rises puts her hands on my shoulders and looks at
me

Your eyes she exclaims I love you Severin you have no idea
how I love you

Yes I have I replied bitterly so much so that you have
arranged for a rendezvous with some one else

I do this only to allure you the more she replied vivaciously I
must have admirers so as not to lose you I don't ever want to lose
you never do you hear for I love only you you alone

She clung passionately to my lips

Oh if I only could as I would give you all of my soul in a kiss 
thus but now come

She slipped into a simple black velvet coat and put a dark bashlyk
Footnote A kind of Russian cap on her head Then she rapidly went
through the gallery and entered the carriage

Gregor will drive she called out to the coachman who withdrew in
surprise

I ascended the driver's seat and angrily whipped up the horses

In the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path Wanda
got out It was night only occasional stars shone through the gray
clouds that fled across the sky By the bank of the Arno stood a man
in a dark cloak with a brigand's hat and looked at the yellow
waves Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery and tapped him on
the shoulder I saw him turn and seize her hand and then they
disappeared behind the green wall

An hour full of torments Finally there was a rustling in the bushes
to one side and they returned

The man accompanied her to the carriage The light of the lamp fell
full and glaringly upon an infinitely young soft and dreamy face
which I had never before seen and played in his long blond curls

She held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect then she
signaled to me and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy
wall which follows the river like a long green screen

                            

The bell at the garden-gate rings It is a familiar face The man
from the Cascine

Whom shall I announce I ask him in French He timidly shakes his
head

Do you perhaps understand some German he asks shyly

Yes Your name please

Oh I haven't any yet he replies embarrassed Tell your
mistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like 
but there she is herself

Wanda had stepped out on the balcony and nodded toward the stranger

Gregor show the gentleman in she called to me

I showed the painter the stairs

Thanks I'll find her now thanks thanks very much He ran up the
steps I remained standing below and looked with deep pity on the
poor German

Venus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair He will
paint her and go mad

                            

It is a sunny winter's day Something that looks like gold trembles
on the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level
of the meadow The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious
in their abundant buds Wanda is sitting in the loggia she is
drawing The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded
as in adoration and looks at her No he rather looks at her face
and is entirely absorbed in it enraptured

But she does not see him neither does she see me who with the
spade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed solely that I may
see her and feel her nearness which produces an effect on me like
poetry like music

                            

The painter has gone It is a hazardous thing to do but I risk it
I go up to the gallery quite close and ask Wanda Do you love the
painter mistress

She looks at me without getting angry shakes her head and finally
even smiles

I feel sorry for him she replies but I do not love him I love no
one I used to love you as ardently as passionately as deeply as
it was possible for me to love but now I don't love even you any
more my heart is a void dead and this makes me sad

Wanda I exclaimed deeply moved

Soon you too will no longer love me she continued tell me when
you have reached that point and I will give back to you your
freedom

Then I shall remain your slave all my life long for I adore you
and shall always adore you I cried seized by that fanaticism of
love which has repeatedly been so fatal to me

Wanda looked at me with a curious pleasure Consider well what you
do she said I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic
towards you so that I might fulfil your dream Something of my old
feeling a sort of real sympathy for you still trembles in my
breast When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give
you your liberty whether I shall not then become really cruel
merciless even brutal toward whether I shall not take a diabolical
pleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships
me idolatrously the while I remain indifferent or love someone else
perhaps I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me Consider
this well

I have long since considered all that I replied as in a glow of
fever I cannot exist cannot live without you I shall die if you
set me at liberty let me remain your slave kill me but do not
drive me away

Very well then be my slave she replied but don't forget that
I no longer love you and your love doesn't mean any more to me than
a dog's and dogs are kicked



To-day I visited the Venus of Medici

It was still early and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was
filled with half-lights like a sanctuary I stood with folded hands
in deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity

But I did not stand for long

Not a human soul was in the gallery not even an Englishman and I
fell down on my knees I looked up at the lovely slender body the
budding breasts the virginal and yet voluptuous face the fragrant
curls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead

                            

My mistress's bell

It is noonday She however is still abed with her arms intertwined
behind her neck

I want to bathe she says and you will attend me Lock the door

I obey

Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked

I descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the
bath my feet gave way beneath me and I had to support myself
against the iron banister After having ascertained that the door
leading to the Loggia and the garden was locked I returned Wanda
was now sitting on the bed with loosened hair wrapped in her green
velvet furs When she made a rapid movement I noticed that the furs
were her only covering It made me start terribly I don't know why
I was like one condemned to death who knows he is on the way to the
scaffold and yet begins to tremble when he sees it

Come Gregor take me on your arms

You mean mistress

You are to carry me don't you understand

I lifted her up so that she rested in my arms while she twined
hers around my neck Slowly step by step I went down the stairs
with her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her
foot sought support against my knee I trembled under the beautiful
burden I was carrying and every moment it seemed as if I had to
break down beneath it

The bath consisted of a wide high rotunda which received a soft
quiet light from a red glass cupola above Two palms extended their
broad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions From here
steps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which
occupied the center

There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs said Wanda
as I let her down on the couch go get it and also bring the whip

I flew upstairs and back again and kneeling put both in my mistress's
hands She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot
which I fastened with the green ribbon Then I prepared the bath I did
this very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me Again
and again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet
cushions and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and
there beneath the furs Some magnetic power stronger than my will
compelled me to look I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in
that which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed and the truth
of this I recognized even more acutely when the basin at last was full
and Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture and stood
before me like the goddess in the Tribuna

At that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled
beauty as did the divinity of long ago I sank down on my knees
before her and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot

My soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier
suddenly was perfectly calm and I now felt no element of cruelty in
Wanda

She slowly descended the stairs and I could watch her with a
calmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was
intermingled I could see her plunge into and rise out of the
crystalline water and the wavelets which she herself raised played
about her like tender lovers

Our nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says a real apple is
more beautiful than a painted one and a living woman is more
beautiful than a Venus of stone

And when she left the bath and the silvery drops and the roseate
light rippled down her body I was seized with silent rapture I
wrapped the linen sheets about her drying her glorious body The
calm bliss remained with me even now when one foot upon me as upon
a footstool she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak
The lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body
Her left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan
in the dark fur of the sleeve while her left hand played carelessly
with the whip

By chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite
and I cried out for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in
a picture The picture was so marvellously beautiful so strange so
imaginative that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that
its lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist

What is the matter asked Wanda

I pointed to the mirror

Ah that is really beautiful she exclaimed too bad one can't
capture the moment and make it permanent

And why not I asked Would not any artist even the most famous
be proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by
means of his brush

The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to
the world I continued still watching her enthusiastically is
horrible all this glorious facial expression this mysterious eye
with its green fires this demonic hair this magnificence of body
The idea fills me with a horror of death of annihilation But the
hand of an artist shall snatch you from this You shall not like the
rest of us disappear absolutely and forever without leaving a trace
of your having been Your picture must live even when you yourself
have long fallen to dust your beauty must triumph beyond death

Wanda smiled

Too bad that present-day Italy hasn't a Titian or Raphael she
said but perhaps love will make amends for genius who knows our
little German might do She pondered

Yes he shall paint you and I will see to it that the god of love
mixes his colors

                            

The young painter has established his studio in her villa he is
completely in her net He has just begun a Madonna a Madonna with
red hair and green eyes Only the idealism of a German would attempt
to use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of
virginity The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I
am Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass's ears
too soon

                            

Now she laughs derisively at us and how she laughs I hear her
insolent melodious laughter in his studio under the open window of
which I stand jealously listening

                            

Are you mad me ah it is unbelievable me as the Mother of God
she exclaimed and laughed again Wait a moment I will show you
another picture of myself one that I myself have painted and you
shall copy it

Her head appeared in the window luminous like a flame under the
sunlight

Gregor

I hurried up the stairs through the gallery into the studio

Lead him to the bath Wanda commanded while she herself hurried
away

A few moments passed and Wanda arrived dressed in nothing but the
sable fur with the whip in her hand she descended the stairs and
stretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion I lay
at her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me her right hand
played with the whip Look at me she said with your deep
fanatical look that's it

The painter had turned terribly pale He devoured the scene with his
beautiful dreamy blue eyes his lips opened but he remained dumb

Well how do you like the picture

Yes that is how I want to paint you said the German but it was
really not a spoken language it was the eloquent moaning the
weeping of a sick soul a soul sick unto death

                            

The charcoal outline of the painting is done the heads and flesh
parts are painted in Her diabolical face is already becoming visible
under a few bold strokes life flashes in her green eyes

Wanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her
breast

This picture like many of those of the Venetian school is
simultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story
explained the painter who again had become pale as death

And what will you call it she asked but what is the matter with
you are you ill

I am afraid  he answered with a consuming look fixed on the
beautiful woman in furs but let us talk of the picture

Yes let us talk about the picture

I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus
for the sake of some mortal man And always cold in this modern world
of ours she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur
and her feet in the lap of her lover I imagine the favorite of a
beautiful despot who whips her slave when she is tired of kissing
him and the more she treads him underfoot the more insanely he loves
her And so I shall call the picture Venus in Furs

                            

The painter paints slowly but his passion grows more and more
rapidly I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide She plays
with him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve and he
feels his blood congealing in the process but it amuses her

During the sitting she nibbles at candies and rolls the paper-wrappers
into little pellets with which she bombards him

I am glad you are in such good humor said the painter but your face
has lost the expression which I need for my picture

The expression which you need for your picture she replied
smiling Wait a moment

She rose and dealt me a blow with the whip The painter looked at
her with stupefaction and a child-like surprise showed on his face
mingled with disgust and admiration

While whipping me Wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruel
contemptuous character which so haunts and intoxicates me

Is this the expression you need for your picture she exclaimed
The painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her
eye

It is the expression  he stammered but I can't paint now 

What said Wanda scornfully perhaps I can help you

Yes  cried the German as if taken with madness whip me too

Oh With pleasure she replied shrugging her shoulders but if
I am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest

Whip me to death cried the painter

Will you let me tie you she asked smiling

Yes  he moaned 

Wanda left the room for a moment and returned with ropes

Well are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of
Venus in Furs the beautiful despot for better or worse she began
ironically

Yes tie me the painter replied dully Wanda tied his hands on
his back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his
body and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window Then she
rolled back the fur seized the whip and stepped in front of him

The scene had a grim attraction for me which I cannot describe I
felt my heart beat when with a smile she drew back her arm for the
first blow and the whip hissed through the air He winced slightly
under the blow Then she let blow after blow rain upon him with her
mouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips until
he finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous blue eyes It
was indescribable

                            

She is sitting for him now alone He is working on her head

She has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain
where I can't be seen but can see everything

What does she intend now

Is she afraid of him She has driven him insane enough to be sure
or is she hatching a new torment for me My knees tremble

They are talking He has lowered his voice so that I cannot
understand a word and she replies in the same way What is the
meaning of this Is there an understanding between them

I suffer frightful torments my heart seems about to burst

He kneels down before her embraces her and presses his head
against her breast and she in her heartlessness laughs and now
I hear her saying aloud

Ah You need another application of the whip

Woman Goddess Are you without a heart can't you love exclaimed
the German don't you even know what it means to love to be
consumed with desire and passion can't you even imagine what I
suffer Have you no pity for me

No she replied proudly and mockingly but I have the whip

She drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat and struck him
in the face with the handle He rose and drew back a couple of paces

Now are you ready to paint again she asked indifferently He did
not reply but again went to the easel and took up his brush and
palette

The painting is marvellously successful It is a portrait which as
far as the likeness goes couldn't be better and at the same time it
seems to have an ideal quality The colors glow are supernatural
almost diabolical I would call them

The painter has put all his sufferings his adoration and all his
execration into the picture

                            

Now he is painting me we are alone together for several hours every
day To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said

You love this woman

Yes

I also love her His eyes were bathed in tears He remained silent
for a while and continued painting

We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells he
murmured to himself She is a demon

                            

The picture is finished She insisted on paying him for it
munificently in the manner of queens

Oh you have already paid me he said with a tormented smile
refusing her offer

Before he left he secretly opened his portfolio and let me look
inside I was startled Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror
and seemed actually to be alive

I shall take it along he said it is mine she can't take it
away from me I have earned it with my heart's blood

                            

I am really rather sorry for the poor painter she said to me to-day
it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am Don't you think so too

I did not dare to reply to her

Oh I forgot that I am talking with a slave I need some fresh air
I want to be diverted I want to forget

The carriage quick

Her new dress is extravagant Russian half-boots of violet-blue
velvet trimmed with ermine and a skirt of the same material
decorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs Above it is an
appropriate close-fitting jacket also richly trimmed and lined with
ermine The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of
Catherine the Second with a small aigrette held in place by a
diamond-agraffe her red hair falls loose down her back She ascends
on the driver's seat and holds the reins herself I take my seat
behind How she lashes on the horses The carriage flies along like
mad

Apparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day to make
conquests and she succeeds completely She is the lioness of the
Cascine People nod to her from carriages on the footpath people
gather in groups to discuss her She pays no attention to anyone
except now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen
with a slight nod

Suddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed
As soon as he sees Wanda he stops his horse and makes it walk When
he is quite close he stops entirely and lets her pass And she too
sees him the lioness the lion Their eyes meet She madly drives
past him but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of
his look and she turns her head after him

My heart stops when I see the half-surprised half-enraptured look
with which she devours him but he is worthy of it

For he is indeed a magnificent specimen of man No rather he is
a man whose like I have never yet seen among the living He is in the
Belvedere graven in marble with the same slender yet steely
musculature with the same face and the same waving curls What makes
him particularly beautiful is that he is beardless If his hips were
less narrow one might take him for a woman in disguise The curious
expression about the mouth the lion's lip which slightly discloses
the teeth beneath lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful
face 

Apollo flaying Marsyas

He wears high black boots closely fitting breeches of white
leather short fur coat of black cloth of the kind worn by Italian
cavalry officers trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops on his
black locks is a red fez

I now understand the masculine Eros and I marvel at Socrates for
having remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this

                            

I have never seen my lioness so excited Her cheeks flamed when she
left from the carriage at her villa She hurried upstairs and with
an imperious gesture ordered me to follow

Walking up and down her room with long strides she began to talk so
rapidly that I was frightened

You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was immediately 

Oh what a man Did you see him What do you think of him Tell me

The man is beautiful I replied dully

He is so beautiful she paused supporting herself on the arm of
a chair that he has taken my breath away

I can understand the impression he has made on you I replied my
imagination carrying me away in a mad whirl I am quite lost in
admiration myself and I can imagine 

You may imagine she laughed aloud that this man is my lover
and that he will apply the lash to you and that you will enjoy being
punished by him

But now go go

                            

Before evening fell I had the desired information

Wanda was still fully dressed when I returned She reclined on the
ottoman her face buried in her hands her hair in a wild tangle
like the red mane of a lioness

What is his name she asked uncanny calm

Alexis Papadopolis

A Greek then

I nodded

He is very young

Scarcely older than you They say he was educated in Paris and
that he is an atheist He fought against the Turks in Candia and is
said to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred
and cruelty than by his bravery

All in all then a man she cried with sparkling eyes

At present he is living in Florence I continued he is said to
be tremendously rich 

I didn't ask you about that she interrupted quickly and sharply
The man is dangerous Aren't you afraid of him I am afraid of him
Has he a wife

No

A mistress

No

What theaters does he attend

To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater where Virginia Marini
and Salvini are acting they are the greatest living artists in
Italy perhaps in Europe

See that you get a box and be quick about it she commanded

But mistress 

Do you want a taste of the whip

                            

You can wait down in the lobby she said when I had placed the
opera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted
the footstool

I am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so
as not to fall down with envy and rage no rage isn't the right
word it was a mortal fear

I saw her in her box dressed in blue moire with a huge ermine cloak
about her bare shoulders he sat opposite I saw them devour each
other with their eyes For both of them the stage Goldoni's Pamela
Salvini Marini the public even the entire world were non-existant
to-night And I what was I at that moment 

                            

To-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador's Does she
know that she will meet him there

At any rate she dressed as if she did A heavy sea-green silk dress
plastically encloses her divine form leaving the bust and arms bare In
her hair which is done into a single flaming knot a white water-lily
blossoms from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose
strands fall down toward her neck There no longer is any trace of
agitation or trembling feverishness in her being She is calm so calm
that I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her
glance Slowly with a weary indolent majesty she ascends the marble
staircase lets her precious wrap slide off and listlessly enters the
hall where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist

For a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze then I pick up her
furs which without my being aware had slipped from my hands They
are still warm from her shoulders

I kiss the spot and my eyes fill with tears

                            

He has arrived

In his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable he is a
beautiful haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men
He stands in the ante-room looking around proudly and his eyes rest
on me for an uncomfortably long time

Under his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear I have a
presentiment that this man can enchain her captivate her subjugate
her and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity I
am filled with envy with jealousy

I feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains merely And what
is most humiliating I want to hate him but I can't Why is that
among all the host of servants he has chosen me

With an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to
him and I I obey his call against my own will

Take my furs he quickly commands

My entire body trembles with resentment but I obey abjectly like
a slave

                            

All night long I waited in the ante-room raving as in a fever
Strange images hovered past my inner eye I saw their meeting their
long exchange of looks I saw her float through the hall in his arms
drunken lying with half-closed lids against his breast I saw him
in the holy of holies of love lying on the ottoman not as slave
but as master and she at his feet On my knees I served them the
tea-tray faltering in my hands and I saw him reach for the whip
But now the servants are talking about him

He is a man who is like a woman he knows that he is beautiful and
he acts accordingly He changes his clothes four or five times a day
like a vain courtesan

In Paris he appeared first in woman's dress and the men assailed
him with love-letters An Italian singer famous equally for his art
and his passionate intensity even invaded his home and lying on his
knees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn't be his

I am sorry he replied smiling I should like to do you the
favor but you will have to carry out your threat for I am a man

                            

The drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree but she
apparently has no thought of leaving

Morning is already peering through the blinds

At last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along
behind her like green waves She advances step by step engaged in
conversation with him

I hardly exist for her any longer she doesn't even trouble to give
me an order

The cloak for madame he commands He of course doesn't think of
looking after her himself

While I put her furs about her he stands to one side with his arms
crossed While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes she
lightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder She asks

And what about the lioness

When the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is
attacked by another the Greek went on with his narrative the
lioness quietly lies down and watches the battle Even if her mate
is worsted she does not go to his aid She looks on indifferently as
he bleeds to death under his opponent's claws and follows the victor
the stronger that is the female's nature

At this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me

It made me shudder though I didn't know why and the red dawn
immerses me and her and him in blood

                            

She did not go to bed but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid
her hair then she ordered me to build a fire and she sat by the
fire-place and stared into the flames

Do you need me any longer mistress I asked my voice failed me
at the last word

Wanda shook her head

I left the room passed through the gallery and sat down on one of
the steps leading from there down into the garden A gentle north
wind brought a fresh damp coolness from the Arno the green hills
extended into the distance in a rosy mist a golden haze hovered over
the city over the round cupola of the Duomo

A few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky

I tore open my coat and pressed my burning forehead against the
marble Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere
child's play but now things were beginning to be serious terribly
serious

I anticipated a catastrophe I visualized it I could lay hold of it
with my hands but I lacked the courage to meet it My strength was
broken And if I am honest with myself neither the pains and
sufferings that threatened me not the humiliations that impended
were the thing that frightened me

I merely felt a fear the fear of losing her whom I loved with a
sort of fanatical devotion but it was so overwhelming so crushing
that I suddenly began to sob like a child

                            

During the day she remained locked in her room and had the negress
attend her When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky I saw
her pass through the garden and carefully following her at a
distance watched her enter the shrine of Venus I stealthily
followed and peered through the chink in the door

She stood before the divine image of the goddess her hands folded
as in prayer and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue
rays over her

                            

On my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such
powerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me I
lighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath
a saint's image and entered her bedroom covering the light with one
hand

The lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted She
had fallen asleep among her pillows lying on her back her hands
clenched breathing heavily A dream seemed to oppress her I slowly
withdrew my hand and let the red light fall full on her wonderful
face

But she did not awaken

I gently set the lamp on the floor sank down beside Wanda's bed
and rested my head on her soft glowing arm

She moved slightly but even now did not awaken I do not know how
long I lay thus in the middle of the night turned as into a stone
by horrible torments

Finally a severe trembling seized me and I was able to cry My
tears flowed over her arm She quivered several times and finally sat
up she brushed her hand across her eyes and looked at me

Severin she exclaimed more frightened than angry

I was unable to reply

Severin she continued softly what is the matter Are you ill

Her voice sounded so sympathetic so kind so full of love that it
clutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud

Severin she began anew My poor unhappy friend Her hand gently
stroked my hair I am sorry very sorry for you but I can't help
you with the best intention in the world I know of nothing that
would cure you

Oh Wanda must it be I moaned in my agony

What Severin What are you talking about

Don't you love me any more I continued Haven't you even a
little bit of pity for me Has the beautiful stranger taken complete
possession of you

I cannot lie she replied softly after a short pause He has made
an impression on me which I haven't yet been able to analyse further
than that I suffer and tremble beneath it It is an impression of the
sort I have met with in the works of poets or on the stage but I
always thought it was a figment of the imagination Oh he is a man
like a lion strong and beautiful and yet gentle not brutal like the
men of our northern world I am sorry for you Severin I am but I
must possess him What am I saying I must give myself to him if he
will have me

Consider your reputation Wanda which so far has remained
spotless I exclaimed even if I no longer mean anything to you

I am considering it she replied I intend to be strong as long
as it is possible I want  she buried her head shyly in the pillows
I want to become his wife if he will have me

Wanda I cried seized again by that mortal fear which always
robs me of my breath makes me lose possession of myself you want
to be his wife belong to him for always Oh Do not drive me away
He does not love you 

Who says that she exclaimed flaring up

He does not love you I went on passionately but I love you I
adore you I am your slave I let you tread me underfoot I want to
carry you on my arms through life

Who says that he doesn't love me she interrupted vehemently

Oh be mine I replied be mine I cannot exist cannot live
without you Have mercy on me Wanda have mercy

She looked at me again and her face had her cold heartless
expression her evil smile

You say he doesn't love me she said scornfully Very well then
get what consolation you can out of it

With this she turned over on the other side and contemptuously
showed me her back

Good God are you a woman without flesh or blood haven't you a
heart as well as I I cried while my breast heaved convulsively

You know what I am she replied coldly I am a woman of stone
Venus in Furs your ideal kneel down and pray to me

Wanda I implored mercy

She began to laugh I buried my face in her pillows Pain had
loosened the floodgates of my tears and I let them flow

For a long time silence reigned then Wanda slowly raised herself

You bore me she began

Wanda

I am tired let me go to sleep

Mercy I implored Do not drive me away No man no one will
love you as I do

Let me go to sleep she turned her back to me again

I leaped up and snatched the poinard which hung beside her bed
from its sheath and placed its point against my breast

I shall kill myself here before your eyes I murmured dully

Do what you please Wanda replied with complete indifference But
let me go to sleep She yawned aloud I am very sleepy

For a moment I stood as if petrified Then I began to laugh and cry
at the same time Finally I placed the poinard in my belt and again
fell on my knees before her

Wanda listen to me only for a few moments I begged

I want to go to sleep Don't you hear she cried leaping angrily
out of bed and pushing me away with her foot You forget that I am
your mistress When I didn't budge she seized the whip and struck
me I rose she struck me again this time right in the face

Wretch slave

With clenched fist held heavenward I left her bedroom with a sudden
resolve She tossed the whip aside and broke out into clear
laughter I can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been
very droll

                            

I have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman who
has treated me so cruelly and is now about to break faith and betray
me as a reward for all my slavish devotion for everything I have
suffered from her I packed my few belongings into a bundle and then
wrote her as follows

Dear Madam 

I have loved you even to madness I have given myself to you as no man
ever has given himself to a woman You have abused my most sacred
emotions and played an impudent frivolous game with me However as
long as you were merely cruel and merciless it was still possible for
me to love you Now you are about to become cheap I am no longer
the slave whom you can kick about and whip You yourself have set me
free and I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise

Severin Kusiemski

I handed these lines to the negress and hastened away as fast as I
could go I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath
Suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped I began to
weep It is humiliating that I want to flee and I can't I turn back 
whither to her whom I abhor and yet at the same time adore

Again I pause I cannot go back I dare not

But how am I to leave Florence I remember that I haven't any money
not a penny Very well then on foot it is better to be an honest
beggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan

But still I can't leave

She has my pledge my word of honor I have to return Perhaps she
will release me

After a few rapid strides I stop again

She has my word of honor and my bond that I shall remain her slave
as long as she desires until she herself gives me my freedom But
I might kill myself

I go through the Cascine down to the Arno where its yellow waters
plash monotonously about a couple of stray willows There I sit and
cast up my final accounts with existence I let my entire life pass
before me in review On the whole it is rather a wretched affair a
few joys an endless number of indifferent and worthless things and
between these an abundant harvest of pains miseries fears
disappointments shipwrecked hopes afflictions sorrow and grief

I thought of my mother whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to
watch waste away beneath a horrible disease of my brother who full
of the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth
without even having put his lips to the cup of life I thought of my
dead nurse my childhood playmates the friends that had striven and
studied with me of all those covered by the cold dead indifferent
earth I thought of my turtle-dove who not infrequently made his
cooing bows to me instead of to his mate All have returned dust
unto dust

I laughed aloud and slid down into the water but at the same
moment I caught hold of one of the willow-branches hanging above the
yellow waves As in a vision I see the woman who has caused all my
misery She hovers above the level of the water luminous in the
sunlight as though she were transparent with red flames about her
head and neck She turns her face toward me and smiles

                            

I am back again dripping wet through glowing with shame and
fever The negress has delivered my letter I am judged lost in the
power of a heartless affronted woman

Well let her kill me I am unable to do it myself and yet I have
no wish to go on living

As I walk around the house she is standing in the gallery leaning
over the railing Her face is full in the light of the sun and her
green eyes sparkle

Still alive she asked without moving I stood silent with bowed
head

Give me back my poinard she continued It is of no use to you
You haven't even the courage to take your own life

I have lost it I replied trembling shaken by chills

She looked me over with a proud scornful glance

I suppose you lost it in the Arno She shrugged her shoulders No
matter Well and why didn't you leave

I mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand

Oh you haven't any money she cried Here With an
indescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse

I did not pick it up

Both of us were silent for some time

You don't want to leave then

I can't

                            

Wanda drives in the Cascine without me and goes to the theater
without me she receives company and the negress serves her No one
asks after me I stray about the garden irresolutely like an animal
that has lost its master

Lying among the bushes I watch a couple of sparrows fighting over
a seed

Suddenly I hear the swish of a woman's dress

Wanda approaches in a gown of dark silk modestly closed up to the
neck the Greek is with her They are in an eager discussion but I
cannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying He stamps
his foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions and he
lashes the air with his riding whip Wanda startles

Is she afraid that he will strike her

Have they gone that far

He has left her she calls him he does not hear her does not want
to hear her

Wanda sadly lowers her head and then sits down on the nearest
stone-bench She sits for a long time lost in thought I watch her with
a sort of malevolent pleasure finally I pull myself together by sheer
force of will and ironically step before her She startles and
trembles all over

I come to wish you happiness I said bowing I see my dear
lady too has found a master

Yes thank God she exclaimed not a new slave I have had enough
of them A master Woman needs a master and she adores him

You adore him Wanda I cried this brutal person 

Yes I love him as I have never loved any one else

Wanda I clenched my fists but tears already filled my eyes and
I was seized by the delirium of passion as by a sweet madness Very
well take him as your husband let him be your master but I want
to remain your slave as long as I live

You want to remain my slave even then she said that would be
interesting but I am afraid he wouldn't permit it

He

Yes he is already jealous of you she exclaimed he of you He
demanded that I dismiss you immediately and when I told him who you
were 

You told him  I repeated thunderstruck

I told him everything she replied our whole story all your
queerness everything and he instead of being amused grew angry
and stamped his foot

And threatened to strike you

Wanda looked to the ground and remained silent

Yes indeed I said with mocking bitterness you are afraid of
him Wanda I threw myself down at her feet and in my agitation
embraced her knees I don't want anything of you except to be your
slave to be always near you I will be your dog-

Do you know you bore me said Wanda indifferently

I leaped up Everything within me was seething

You are now no longer cruel but cheap I said clearly and
distinctly accentuating every word

You have already written that in your letter Wanda replied with
a proud shrug of the shoulders A man of brains should never repeat
himself

The way you are treating me I broke out what would you call it

I might punish you she replied ironically but I prefer this
time to reply with reasons instead of lashes You have no right to
accuse me Haven't I always been honest with you Haven't I warned
you more than once Didn't I love you with all my heart even
passionately and did I conceal the fact from you that it was
dangerous to give yourself into my power to abase yourself before
me and that I want to be dominated But you wished to be my
plaything my slave You found the highest pleasure in feeling the
foot the whip of an arrogant cruel woman What do you want now

Dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me but you were the
first to awaken them If I now take pleasure in torturing you
abusing you it is your fault you have made of me what I now am and
now you are even unmanly weak and miserable enough to accuse me

Yes I am guilty I said but haven't I suffered because of it
Let us put an end now to the cruel game

That is my wish too she replied with a curious deceitful look

Wanda I exclaimed violently don't drive me to extremes you see
that I am a man again

A fire of straw she replied which makes a lot of stir for a
moment and goes out as quickly as it flared up You imagine you can
intimidate me and you only make yourself ridiculous Had you been
the man I first thought you were serious reserved stern I would
have loved you faithfully and become your wife Woman demands that
she can look up to a man but one like you who voluntarily places his
neck under her foot she uses as a welcome plaything only to toss
it aside when she is tired of it

Try to toss me aside I said jeeringly Some toys are dangerous

Don't challenge me exclaimed Wanda Her eyes began to flash and
a flush entered her cheeks

If you won't be mine now I continued with a voice stifled with
rage no one else shall possess you either

What play is this from she mocked seizing me by the breast She
was pale with anger at this moment Don't challenge me she
continued I am not cruel but I don't know whether I may not become
so and whether then there will be any bounds

What worse can you do than to make your lover your husband I
exclaimed more and more enraged

I might make you his slave she replied quickly are you not in
my power Haven't I the agreement But of course you will merely
take pleasure in it if I have you bound and say to him

Do with him what you please

Woman are you mad I cried

I am entirely rational she said calmly I warn you for the last
time Don't offer any resistance one who has gone as far as I have
gone might easily go still further I feel a sort of hatred for you
and would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death I am still
restraining myself but 

Scarcely master of myself any longer I seized her by the wrist and
forced her to the ground so that she lay on her knees before me

Severin she cried Rage and terror were painted on her face

I shall kill you if you marry him I threatened the words came
hoarsely and dully from my breast You are mine I won't let you go
I love you too much Then I clutched her and pressed her close to
me my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had
in my belt

Wanda fixed a large calm incomprehensible look on me

I like you that way she said carelessly Now you are a man and
at this moment I know I still love you

Wanda I wept with rapture and bent down over her covering her
dear face with kisses and she suddenly breaking into a loud gay
laugh said Have you finished with your ideal now are you
satisfied with me

You mean I stammered that you weren't serious

I am very serious she gaily continued I love you only you and
you you foolish little man didn't know that everything was only
make-believe and play-acting How hard it often was for me to strike
you with the whip when I would have rather taken your head and
covered it with kisses But now we are through with that aren't we
I have played my cruel role better than you expected and now you
will be satisfied with my being a good little wife who isn't
altogether unattractive Isn't that so We will live like rational
people 

You will marry me I cried overflowing with happiness

Yes marry you you dear darling man whispered Wanda kissing my
hands

I drew her up to my breast

Now you are no longer Gregor my slave said she but Severin
the dear man I love 

And he you don't love him I asked in agitation

How could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type You were
blind to everything I was really afraid for you

I almost killed myself for your sake

Really she cried ah I still tremble at the thought that you
were already in the Arno

But you saved me I replied tenderly You hovered over the
waters and smiled and your smile called me back to life

                            

I have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies
silently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles I feel
like one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium or
like a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that
momentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe
shore

                            

I hate this Florence where you have been so unhappy she
declared as I was saying good-night to her I want to leave
immediately tomorrow you will be good enough to write a couple of
letters for me and while you are doing that I will drive to the
city to pay my farewell visits Is that satisfactory to you

Of course you dear sweet beautiful woman

                            

Early in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept
Her tenderness is positively wonderful I should never have believed
that she could be so tender

                            

She has now been gone for over four hours I have long since
finished the letters and am now sitting in the gallery looking down
the street to see whether I cannot discover her carriage in the
distance I am a little worried about her and yet I know there is
no reason under heaven why I should doubt or fear However a feeling
of oppression weighs me down and I cannot rid myself of it It is
probably the sufferings of the past days which still cast their
shadows into my soul

                            

She is back radiant with happiness and contentment

Well has everything gone as you wished I asked tenderly kissing
her hand

Yes dear heart she replied and we shall leave to-night Help
me pack my trunks

                            

Toward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her
letters myself I took her carriage and was back within an hour

Mistress has asked for you said the negress with a grin as I
ascended the wide marble stairs

Has anyone been here

No one she replied crouching down on the steps like a black cat

I slowly passed through the drawing-room and then stood before her
bedroom door

Why does my heart beat so Am I not perfectly happy

Opening the door softly I draw back the portiere Wanda is lying on
the ottoman and does not seem to notice me How beautiful she looks
in her silver-gray dress which fits closely and while displaying
in tell-tale fashion her splendid figure leaves her wonderful bust
and arms bare

Her hair is interwoven with and held up by a black velvet ribbon
A mighty fire is burning in the fire-place the hanging lamp casts
a reddish glow and the whole room is as if drowned in blood

Wanda I said at last

Oh Severin she cried out joyously I have been impatiently
waiting for you She leaped up and folded me in her arms She sat
down again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her
side but I softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her
lap

Do you know I am very much in love with you to-day she whispered
brushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes

How beautiful your eyes are I have always loved them as the best
of you but to-day they fairly intoxicate me I am all  She
extended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath
her red lashes

And you you are cold you hold me like a block of wood wait I'll
stir you with the fire of love she said and again clung fawningly
and caressingly to my lips

I no longer please you I suppose I'll have to be cruel to you
again evidently I have been too kind to you to-day Do you know you
little fool what I shall do I shall whip you for a while 

But child 

I want to

Wanda

Come let me bind you she continued and ran gaily through the
room I want to see you very much in love do you understand Here
are the ropes I wonder if I can still do it

She began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind
my back pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner

So she said with gay eagerness Can you still move

No

Fine 

She then tied a noose in a stout rope threw it over my head and
let it slip down as far as the hips She drew it tight and bound me
to a pillar

A curious tremor seized me at that moment

I have a feeling as if I were about to be executed I said with a
low voice

Well you shall have a thorough punishment to-day exclaimed Wanda

But put on your fur-jacket please I said

I shall gladly give you that pleasure she replied She got her
kazabaika and put it on Then she stood in front of me with
her arms folded across her chest and looked at me out of half-closed
eyes

Do you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius she asked

I remember it only vaguely what about it

A courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of
Syracuse It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were
to be shut and then pushed into a mighty furnace

As soon as the iron ox began to get hot and the condemned person
began to cry out in his torment his wails sounded like the bellowing
of an ox

Dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor and to put his
invention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox

It is a very instructive story

It was you who innoculated me with selfishness pride and cruelty
and you shall be their first victim I now literally enjoy having a
human being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power
I love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I
especially a man who loves me

Do you still love me

Even to madness I exclaimed

So much the better she replied and so much the more will you
enjoy what I am about to do with you now

What is the matter with you I asked I don't understand you
there is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day and you are
strangely beautiful completely Venus in Furs

Without replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me
I was again seized by my fanatical passion

Where is the whip I asked

Wanda laughed and withdrew a couple of steps

You really insist upon being punished she exclaimed proudly
tossing back her head

Yes

Suddenly Wanda's face was completely transformed It was as if
disfigured by rage for a moment she seemed even ugly to me

Very well then you whip him she called loudly

At the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black
curls through the curtains of her four-poster bed At first I was
speechless petrified There was a horribly comic element in the
situation I would have laughed aloud had not my position been at
the same time so terribly cruel and humiliating

It went beyond anything I had imagined A cold shudder ran down my
back when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots his
tight-fitting white breeches and his short velvet jacket and I saw
his athletic limbs

You are indeed cruel he said turning to Wanda

Only inordinately fond of pleasure she replied with a wild sort
of humor Pleasure alone lends value to existence whoever enjoys
does not easily part from life whoever suffers or is needy meets
death like a friend

But whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the
ancient world he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others
he must never feel pity he must be ready to harness others to his
carriage or his plough as though they were animals He must know how to
make slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does and use them for
his service and pleasure without remorse It is not his affair whether
they like it or whether they go to rack and ruin He must always
remember this that if they had him in their power as he has them they
would act in exactly the same way and he would have to pay for their
pleasure with his sweat and blood and soul That was the world of the
ancients pleasure and cruelty liberty and slavery went hand in hand
People who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of necessity have
slaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds and gladiators who will
do battle the while they banquet and they must not mind if by chance a
bit of blood bespatters them

Her words brought back my complete self-possession

Unloosen me I exclaimed angrily

Aren't you my slave my property replied Wanda Do you want me
to show you the agreement

Untie me I threatened otherwise  I tugged at the ropes

Can he tear himself free she asked He has threatened to kill me

Be entirely at ease said the Greek testing my fetters

I shall call for help I began again

No one will hear you replied Wanda and no one will hinder me
from abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game
with you she continued repeating with satanic mockery phrases from
my letter to her

Do you think I am at this moment merely cruel and merciless or am
I also about to become cheap What Do you still love me or do you
already hate and despise me Here is the whip  She handed it to the
Greek who quickly stepped closer

Don't you dare I exclaimed trembling with indignation I won't
permit it 

Oh because I don't wear furs the Greek replied with an ironical
smile and he took his short sable from the bed

You are adorable exclaimed Wanda kissing him and helping him
into his furs

May I really whip him he asked

Do with him what you please replied Wanda

Beast I exclaimed utterly revolted

The Greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the
whip His muscles swelled when he drew back his arms and made the
whip hiss through the air I was bound like Marsyas while Apollo was
getting ready to flay me

My look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling
where Samson lying at Delilah's feet was about to have his eyes put
out by the Philistines The picture at that moment seemed to me like
a symbol an eternal parable of passion and lust of the love of man
for woman Each one of us in the end is a Samson I thought and
ultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves
whether he wears an ordinary coat or sables

Now watch me break him in said the Greek He showed his teeth
and his face acquired the blood-thirsty expression which startled
me the first time I saw him

And he began to apply the lash so mercilessly with such frightful
force that I quivered under each blow and began to tremble all over
with pain Tears rolled down over my cheeks In the meantime Wanda
lay on the ottoman in her fur-jacket supporting herself on her arm
she looked on with cruel curiosity and was convulsed with laughter

The sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes
of an adored woman cannot be described I almost went mad with shame
and despair

What was most humiliating was that at first I felt a certain wild
supersensual stimulation under Apollo's whip and the cruel laughter
of my Venus no matter how horrible my position was But Apollo
whipped on and on blow after blow until I forgot all about poetry
and finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage and cursed my wild
dreams woman and love

All of a sudden I saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion
and lust have led man ever since Holofernes and Agamemnon into a
blind alley into the net of woman's treachery into misery slavery
and death

It was as though I were awakening from a dream

Blood was already flowing under the whip I wound like a worm that
is trodden on but he whipped on without mercy and she continued to
laugh without mercy In the meantime she locked her packed trunk and
slipped into her travelling furs and was still laughing when she
went downstairs on his arm and entered the carriage

Then everything was silent for a moment

I listened breathlessly

The carriage door slammed the horse began to pull the rolling of
the carriage for a short time then all was over

                            

For a moment I thought of taking vengeance of killing him but I
was bound by the abominable agreement So nothing was left for me to
do except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth

                            

My first impulse after this the most cruel catastrophe of my life
was to seek laborious tasks dangers and privations I wanted to
become a soldier and go to Asia or Algiers but my father was old and
ill and wanted me

So I quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his
burdens and learned how to look after the estate which I had never
done before To labor and to do my duty was comforting like a
drink of fresh water Then my father died and I inherited the estate
but it meant no change

I had put on my own Spanish boots and went on living just as
rationally as if the old man were standing behind me looking over
my shoulder with his large wise eyes

One day a box arrived accompanied by a letter I recognized Wanda's
writing

Curiously moved I opened it and read

Sir 

Now that over three years have passed since that night in Florence
I suppose I may confess to you that I loved you deeply You
yourself however stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and
your insane passion From the moment that you became my slave I knew
it would be impossible for you ever to become my husband However
I found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own person
and while I gloriously amused myself perhaps to cure you

I found the strong man for whom I felt a need and I was as happy
with him as I suppose it is possible for any one to be on this
funny ball of clay

But my happiness like all things mortal was of short duration
About a year ago he fell in a duel and since then I have been living
in Paris like an Aspasia 

And you Your life surely is not without its sunshine if you have
gained control of your imagination and those qualities in you have
materialized which at first so attracted me to you your clarity of
intellect kindness of heart and above all else your moral
seriousness

I hope you have been cured under my whip the cure was cruel but
radical In memory of that time and of a woman who loved you
passionately I am sending you the portrait by the poor German

Venus in Furs

I had to smile and as I fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly
stood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine with the
whip in her hand And I continued to smile at the woman I had once
loved so insanely at the fur-jacket that had once so entranced me
at the whip and ended by smiling at myself and saying The cure was
cruel but radical but the main point is I have been cured

                            

And the moral of the story I said to Severin when I put the
manuscript down on the table

That I was a donkey he exclaimed without turning around for he
seemed to be embarrassed If only I had beaten her

A curious remedy I exclaimed which might answer with your
peasant-women 

Oh they are used to it he replied eagerly but imagine the
effect upon one of our delicate nervous hysterical ladies 

But the moral

That woman as nature has created her and as man is at present
educating her is his enemy She can only be his slave or his despot
but never his companion This she can become only when she has
the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work

At present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil and I
was the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him do you
understand

The moral of the tale is this whoever allows himself to be
whipped deserves to be whipped

The blows as you see have agreed with me the roseate supersensual
mist has dissolved and no one can ever make me believe again that
these sacred apes of Benares Footnote One of Schopenhauer's
designations for women or Plato's rooster Footnote Diogenes
threw a plucked rooster into Plato's school and exclaimed Here
you have Plato's human being are the image of God
