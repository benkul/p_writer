The high estimation in which I have ever held the works of Rembrandt
has been greatly increased by my going through this examination of his
various excellencies and such will ever be the case when the emanations
of genius are investigated like the lustre of precious stones their
luminous colour shines from the centre not from the surface With such
a mine of rich ore as the works of Rembrandt contain it is necessary
to apologise for the paucity of examples offered for in a work of this
kind I have been obliged to confine myself to a certain brevity and
a limited number of illustrations still I must do my publisher the
justice to say he has not grudged any expense that would be the means
of doing credit to the great artist the enlightened patron or my
own reputation Another circumstance has been elicited in preparing
this work for publication the great interest that all have shown in
this humble attempt to make Rembrandt and his works more generally
appreciated His genius and productions seem to be congenial to the
English taste As a colourist he will ultimately lay the foundation of
the British School of Painting and prove the justice of Du Fresnoy's
lines 

  He who colours well must colour bright
   Think not that praise to gain by sickly white


Had it been possible I would have given some examples of his colour as
well as of his chiaro-scuro but I found his great charm consists more
in the tone of his colouring than its arrangement I have mentioned in
the body of the work that Sir Joshua certainly the greatest master of
colour we have yet had in England frequently speaks ambiguously of many
of Rembrandt's pictures I am therefore bound to quote a remark that he
makes to his praise In his Memoranda he says I considered myself as
playing a great game and instead of beginning to save money I laid it
out faster than I got it in purchasing the best examples of art that
could be procured for I even borrowed money for this purpose The
possession of pictures by Titian Vandyke Rembrandt &c I considered
as the best kind of wealth

With these remarks I must now launch the result of my labours having
had constantly in mind that feeling which an advocate has in a good
cause not to expect by all his exertions to increase the reputation
of his client but an anxiety not to damage it by his weakness Before
concluding I must again revert to the interest that all my friends
have taken in the success of this publication and though it may
appear invidious to particularise any I cannot omit mention of that
enthusiastic admirer of Rembrandt my young friend Mr E W Cooke
the Messrs Smith of Lisle-street the connoisseurs and extensive
dealers in his Etchings Mr Carpenter the keeper of the prints in
the British Museum and lastly my young literary friend Mr Peter
Cunningham who has from the beginning entered heartily into the
cause of Rembrandt and his Works

REMBRANDT


In commencing an account of the life of Rembrandt Van Rhÿn and his
works I feel both a pleasure and a certain degree of confidence as
from my first using a pencil his pictures have been my delight and
gratification which have continued to increase through a long life of
investigation Though I cannot expect to enhance the high estimation
in which Rembrandt is held by all persons competent to appreciate his
extraordinary powers nevertheless the publication of the results of
my study may tend to spread a knowledge of his principles and practice
which may be advantageous to similar branches in other schools for
notwithstanding that his style is in the greatest degree original and
peculiar to himself yet it is founded upon those effects existing in
nature which are to be discovered more or less in the works of all the
great masters of colouring and chiaro-scuro Of his early life little
is known for unless cradled in the higher circles of society the
early lives of eminent men frequently remain shrouded in obscurity
The development of their genius alone draws attention to their history
which is generally progressive hence a retrospective view is ambiguous
Little is known either of Rembrandt's birth or the place of his death
what is known has already been related from Houbraken to Bryan and
from Bryan to Nieuwenhuys and anecdotes have accumulated for something
new must be said It is however fortunate that in searching into
the source from which this extraordinary artist drew his knowledge
we have only to look into the great book of Nature which existed at
the time of Apelles and Raffaelle and notwithstanding the diversity of
styles adopted by all succeeding painters beauties and peculiarities
are still left sufficient to establish the highest reputation for any
one who has the genius to perceive them and the industry to make them
apparent This was the cause of Rembrandt's captivating excellence
neither a combination of Coreggio and Titian nor of Murillo and
Velasquez but as if all the great principles of chiaro-scuro and colour
were steeped and harmonized in the softening shades of twilight and
this we perceive in nature producing the most soothing and bewitching
results These digressions may however come more properly into notice
when Rembrandt's principles of colour come under review

Rembrandt Van Rhÿn the subject of this memoir was born in the year
     between Leydendorp and Koukerk in the neighbourhood of Leyden on
the Rhÿn but certainly not in a mill as there is no habitable dwelling
in the one now known as his father's My excellent young friend Mr E
W Cooke whose works breathe the true spirit of the best of the Dutch
school in a letter upon this subject says 

    MY DEAR SIR

    I send you another sketch of the mill the picture including the
    doorzigte or view out of the window I painted on the spot and
    that picture is now in the possession of the King of Holland having
    taken it back with me to show him The mill was a magazine for powder
    during the Spanish invasion it was soon after converted into a corn
    mill and was in the possession of Hernan Geritz Van Rhÿn when his
    son Rembrandt was born it is situated at Koukerk on the old Rhÿn
    near Leyden I hope you will correct the vulgar error that Rembrandt
    was born IN a mill There are often dwelling houses attached to
    water-mills such as we have in England but in Holland not such a
    structure as a water-mill with water-power the water-mills there
    are only draining mills such as we have in Lincolnshire Norfolk
    &c Surely the noise and movement of a windmill would ill accord with
    the confinement of any lady especially the mother of so glorious a
    fellow as Rembrandt For the honour of such association I hope you
    will not omit my name in the work for I painted three pictures of
    that precious relic

    Yours &c

Illustration EXTERIOR OF THE SAME

The mill now known as the one possessed by Rembrandt's father is built
of stone with an inscription and Rembrandt in gold letters over
the door The one etched by his eminent son is a wooden structure which
must have long since fallen into decay As they are both interesting
from association of ideas I have given etchings of them

The mother of Rembrandt was Neeltje Willems Van Zuitbroek whose
portrait he has etched As he was an only child his parents were
anxious to give him a good education and therefore sent him to the
Latin school at Leyden in order to bring him up to the profession of
the law but like our own inimitable Shakspere he picked up small
Latin and less Greek Having shown an early inclination for painting
they placed him under the tuition of Jacob Van Zwaanenburg a painter
unmentioned by any biographer he afterwards entered the studio of Peter
Lastman and finally received instruction from Jacob Pinas The two
last had visited Rome but notwithstanding could have given little
instruction to Rembrandt as their works show no proof of their having
studied the Italian school to much purpose After receiving a knowledge
of a few rules such as they could communicate he returned home and
commenced painting from nature when he laid the foundation of a style
in art unapproached either before his time or since In      he is said
by Houbraken to have visited the Hague when by the price he received
for one of his pictures he discovered his value as an artist The
neighbourhood of the Rhine was now given up for the city of Amsterdam
where he set up his easel in the year      under the patronage of the
Burgomaster Six and other wealthy admirers of the fine arts

Rembrandt's first works like all the early works of eminent artists
were carefully finished the work that raised him to the greatest
notice in the first instance is Professor Tulpius giving an Anatomical
Lecture on a dead Body  and is dated      Reynolds in his Tour
through Flanders speaking of this picture says The Professor
Tulpius dissecting a corpse which lies on the table by Rembrandt To
avoid making it an object disagreeable to look at the figure is just
cut at the wrist There are seven other portraits coloured like nature
itself fresh and highly finished One of the figures behind has a
paper in his hand on which are written the names of the rest Rembrandt
has also added his own name with the date      The dead body is
perfectly well drawn a little foreshortened and seems to have been
just washed nothing can be more truly the colour of dead flesh The
legs and feet which are nearest the eye are in shadow the principal
light which is on the body is by that means preserved of a compact
form all these figures are dressed in black He further adds Above
stairs is another Rembrandt of the same kind of subject Professor
Nieman standing by a dead body which is so much foreshortened that the
hands and feet almost touch each other the dead man lies on his back
with his feet towards the spectator There is something sublime in the
character of the head which reminds one of Michael Angelo the whole is
finely painted the colouring much like Titian

Simeon in the Temple in the Museum of the Hague painted in      is in
his first manner as are The Salutation in the Gallery of the Marquis
of Westminster painted in      and The Woman taken in Adultery in the
National Gallery painted in      all on panel and finished with the
care and minuteness of Gerhard Dow His most successful career may be
taken from      to      About the year      he married Miss Saskia Van
Uylenburg by whom he had an only son named Titus the inheritor of the
little wealth left after his father's embarrassments but though bred
to the arts inheriting little of his father's genius In what part of
Amsterdam he resided at this time we have no record nor is the house
now shown as Rembrandt's and which was the subject of a mortgage
sufficiently authenticated to prove its identity he may have lived in
it but it could not at any time have been sufficiently capacious to
contain all the effects given in the catalogue extracted from the
register by Mr Nieuwenhuys

The late Sir David Wilkie in a letter to his sister says At the
Hague we were delayed with rain which continued nearly the whole of our
way through Leyden Haarlem and Amsterdam Wherever we went our great
subject of interest was seeing the native places of the great Dutch
painters and the models and materials which they have immortalized
At Amsterdam we sallied forth in the evening in search of the house
of Rembrandt it is in what is now the Jews' quarter and is in short
a Jew's old china shop it is well built four stories high but it
greatly disappointed me The shop is high in the ceiling but all the
other rooms are low and little and compared with the houses of Titian
at Venice of Claude at Rome and of Rubens at Antwerp is quite
unworthy the house of the great master of the school of Holland Even if
stuffed as it is now with every description of the pottery of Canton
it could not have held even a sixth part of the inventory Nieuwenhuys
found as the distrained effects of Rembrandt and the only solution is
that he may have once lived there but as his will still extant is
dated in another street and as several of the pictures he painted could
not be contained in the rooms we were in we must conclude that like
the shell which encloses the caterpillar it was only a temporary abode
for the winged genius to whom art owes so much of its brilliancy

As the place of his residence is veiled in obscurity so is the place of
his demise which is supposed to have taken place in      as Mr Smith
in a note to his Life of Rembrandt says that no picture is recorded
bearing a later date than      and the balance of his property was paid
over to his son in     

Mr Woodburn in a Catalogue of his Drawings says It is uncertain
what became of him after his bankruptcy or where he died a search has
been made among the burials at Amsterdam until the year      but his
name does not occur probably Baldinucci is correct in stating that he
died at Stockholm in      others have mentioned Hull and some give
a credence to his having fled to Yarmouth during his troubles and
mention two pictures a lawyer and his wife said to have been painted
there they are whole lengths and certainly in his later manner but
I could not gather any authentic account to build conjecture upon as
the intercourse between Amsterdam and Yarmouth has been kept up from
olden time and a Dutch fair held every three years on the shore The
ancestors of the family in whose possession they still are may have
visited Holland but amongst such conflicting opinions it is useless
to attempt elucidation of the truth of this We may rest certain that
his works will be appreciated in proportion as a knowledge of their
excellence is extended

We cannot reflect upon the foregoing Catalogue without regretting that
Rembrandt in his old age should have like our own Milton

                      Fall'n on evil days
  On evil days though fall'n and evil tongues


The troubles existing at that time pervaded the whole of Europe and
works both of poetry and painting produced little emolument to the
possessors consequently the whole of this rich assemblage of works of
art the accumulation of years fell a sacrifice to the hammer of the
auctioneer producing little more than four thousand nine hundred
guilders By its list however we are enabled to refute the assertion
of many of his biographers that he neglected the antique and the works
of the great masters of the Italian school the catalogue including
casts from ancient sculpture and drawings and prints after Michael
Angelo Raffaelle and Titian which at that time were rare and of great
value We find by a memorandum on the back of one of Rembrandt's proofs
on India paper of his etching of Christ Healing the Sick which now
goes by the name of The Hundred Guilder Print that wishing to
possess a print of the Plague by Mark Antonio after Raffaelle valued
by the dealer Van Zomers at a hundred florins he gave the proof in
exchange and further that such proofs were never sold but given as
presents to his friends We may perceive by this the anxiety he had to
collect works that were excellent As we do not discover amongst the
various articles enumerated either palette or brushes we may infer
that on quitting Amsterdam he carried off all his working apparatus

With this short notice of his life and these few remarks I must now
enter into what is more properly the subject of this work a critical
examination into his principles and practice

Footnote   Mr Nieuwenhuys in a note in his Life of Rembrandt
mentions that the Directors of the Anatomical Theatre resolved to sell
this picture by auction for the purpose of augmenting the funds for
supporting the widows of members and in consequence the sale was
announced for Monday the  th of August      Since the year      until
this period it had always remained in that establishment as a gift
from Professor N Tulp who presented it as a remembrance of himself and
colleagues Mr N had no sooner heard that the piece in question was to
be sold than he went to Amsterdam with the intention of purchasing
it but upon arriving was informed that his Majesty the King of the
Netherlands had opposed the sale and given orders to the Minister for
the Home Department to obtain it for the sum of       guldens and
caused it to be placed in the Museum at the Hague where it remains

REMBRANDT AND HIS WORKS


The early pictures in all ages either merely indicate the character
of bas-reliefs or single statues a cold continuity of outline and
an absence of foreshortening The first move in advance and that
which constitutes their pictorial character in contradistinction to
sculpture is an assemblage of figures repeating the various forms
contained in the principal ones and thus rendering them less harsh by
extension and doubling of the various shapes as we often perceive in a
first sketch of a work where the eye of the spectator chooses out of
the multiplicity of outlines those forms most agreeable to his taste
The next step to improvement and giving the work a more natural
appearance is the influence of shadow so as to make the outlines of
the prominent more distinct and those in the background less harsh
and cutting and consequently more retiring The application of shadow
however not only renders works of art more natural by giving the
appearance of advancing and retiring to objects represented upon a flat
surface thus keeping them in their several situations according to the
laws of aërial perspective but enables the artist to draw attention to
the principal points of the story and likewise to preserve the whole in
agreeable form by losing and pronouncing individual parts Coreggio was
the first who carried out this principle to any great extent but it was
reserved for Rembrandt by his boldness and genius to put a limit to
its further application Breadth the constituent character of this mode
of treatment cannot be extended indeed it is said that Rembrandt
himself extended it too far for absorbing seven-eighths in obscurity
and softness though it renders the remaining portion more brilliant
yet costs too much This principle however contains the greatest
poetry of the art in contradistinction to the severe outline and harsh
colouring of the great historical style




COMPOSITION


To arrive at a true knowledge of the inventions and compositions of
Rembrandt it is necessary in the first instance to examine those
of Albert Durer the Leonardo da Vinci of Germany The inventions of
this extraordinary man are replete with the finest feelings of art
notwithstanding the Gothic dryness and fantastic forms of his figures
The folds of his draperies are more like creased pieces of paper than
cloth and his representation of the naked is either bloated and
coarse or dry and meagre His backgrounds have all the extravagant
characteristics of a German romance and are totally destitute of aërial
perspective yet with the exception of the character of the people and
scenery of Nuremburg he is not more extravagant in his forms than the
founder of the Florentine school and had he been educated in Italy he
in all probability would have rivalled Raffaelle in the purity of his
design In his journal which he kept when he travelled into the
Netherlands he mentions some prints he sent to Rome in exchange for
those he expected in return and it is mentioned that Raffaelle admired
his works highly The multitude of his engravings both on copper and
wood which were spread over Germany influenced in a great degree
the style of composition of those artists who came after him and
accordingly we see many points of coincidence in the compositions of
Rembrandt A century however had opened up a greater insight into the
mysteries of painting than either Leonardo da Vinci or Albert Durer ever
thought of one alone viz aërial perspective seems to mark the line
between the ancient and modern school for though Durer invented several
instruments for perfecting lineal perspective his works exhibit no
attempt at giving the indistinctness of distant objects To Rubens
Germany and Holland were indebted for this essential part of the art so
necessary to a true representation of Nature This great genius in his
contemplation of the works of Titian and others both at Venice and in
Madrid soon emancipated the art of his country from the Gothic hardness
of Lucas Cranach Van Eyck and Albert Durer but notwithstanding his
taste and knowledge of what constituted the higher qualities of the
Italian school the irregular combinations and multitudinous assemblage
of figures found in the early German compositions remained with him to
the last His works are like a melodrama filled with actors who have
no settled action or expression allotted them while in the works of
Raffaelle and other great composers the persons introduced are limited
to the smallest number necessary to explain the story This condensing
of the interest if I may use the expression was borrowed originally
from the Greeks of whose sculptures the Romans availed themselves to a
great degree On the other hand this looseness of arrangement and what
may be termed ornamental not only spread through Germany but infected
the schools of Venice witness the works of Tintoret and Paul Veronese
in which the expression of the countenance absolutely goes for nothing
and the whole arrangement is drawn out in a picturesque point of view
merely to amuse and gratify the eye of the spectator

Now with all these infectious examples before him Rembrandt has done
much to concentrate the action and reduce the number drawn out on the
canvas to the mere personages who figure in the history Witness his
Salutation of the Virgin in the Marquis of Westminster's collection
which is evidently engendered from the idea contained in the design of
Albert Durer His strict application to nature while it enabled him
to destroy the unmeaning combinations of his predecessors led him
into many errors by the simple fact of drawing from the people in his
presence But are not others chargeable with some incongruities Are the
Madonnas of Murillo anything but a transcript of the women of Andalusia
The women of Venice figure in the historical compositions of Titian and
Paul Veronese and the Fornarina of Raffaelle is present in his most
sacred subjects those therefore who accuse Rembrandt of vulgarity
of form might with equal justice draw an invidious comparison between
classic Italian and high Dutch In many of his compositions he has
embodied the highest feeling and sentiment and in his study of natural
simplicity approaches Raffaelle nearer than any of the Flemish or Dutch
painters Of course as a colourist and master of light and shade he
is all powerful but I allude at present to the mere conception and
embodying of his subjects on this head

Fuseli says Rembrandt was in my opinion a genius of the first
class in whatever relates not to form In spite of the most portentous
deformity and without considering the spell of his chiaro-scuro such
were his powers of nature such the grandeur pathos or simplicity of
his composition from the most elevated or extensive arrangement to
the meanest and most homely that the best cultivated eye the purest
sensibility and the most refined taste dwell on them equally
enthralled Shakspere alone excepted no one combined with so much
transcendent excellence so many in all other men unpardonable
faults and reconciled us to them He possessed the full empire of
light and shade and of all the tints that float between them he tinged
his pencil with equal success in the cool of dawn in the noon-day ray
in the livid flash in evanescent twilight and rendered darkness
visible Though made to bend a steadfast eye on the bolder phenomena of
nature yet he knew how to follow her into her calmest abodes gave
interest to insipidity and baldness and plucked a flower in every
desert None ever like Rembrandt knew how to improve an accident into
a beauty or give importance to a trifle If ever he had a master he
had no followers Holland was not made to comprehend his power

And in another lecture speaking of the advantage of a low horizon he
says What gives sublimity to Rembrandt's Ecce Homo more than this
principle a composition which though complete hides in its grandeur
the limits of its scenery Its form is a pyramid whose top is lost in
the sky as its base in tumultuous murky waves From the fluctuating
crowds who inundate the base of the tribunal we rise to Pilate
surrounded and perplexed by the varied ferocity of the sanguinary
synod to whose remorseless gripe he surrenders his wand and from
him we ascend to the sublime resignation of innocence in Christ and
regardless of the roar securely repose on his countenance Such is the
grandeur of a conception which in its blaze absorbs the abominable
detail of materials too vulgar to be mentioned Had the materials been
equal to the conception and composition the Ecce Homo of Rembrandt
even unsupported by the magic of its light and shade or his spell of
colours would have been an assemblage of superhuman powers

Reynolds in his Eighth Discourse speaking of the annoyance the mind
feels at the display of too much variety and contrast proceeds to
say To apply these general observations which belong equally to all
arts to ours in particular In a composition where the objects are
scattered and divided into many equal parts the eye is perplexed and
fatigued from not knowing where to find the principal action or which
is the principal figure for where all are making equal pretensions to
notice all are in equal danger of neglect The expression which is used
very often on these occasions is the piece wants repose a word which
perfectly expresses a relief of the mind from that state of hurry and
anxiety which it suffers when looking at a work of this character On
the other hand absolute unity that is a large work consisting of one
group or mass of light only would be as defective as an heroic poem
without episode or any collateral incidents to recreate the mind with
that variety which it requires An instance occurs to me of two painters
Rembrandt and Poussin of characters totally opposite to each other in
every respect but in nothing more than in their mode of composition and
management of light and shadow Rembrandt's manner is absolute unity he
often has but one group and exhibits little more than one spot of light
in the midst of a large quantity of shadow if he has a second mass that
second bears no proportion to the principal Poussin on the contrary
has scarcely any principle mass of light at all and his figures are
often too much dispersed without sufficient attention to place them in
groups The conduct of these two painters is entirely the reverse of
what might be expected from their general style and character the works
of Poussin being as much distinguished for simplicity as those of
Rembrandt for combination Even this conduct of Poussin might proceed
from too great affection to simplicity of another kind too great a
desire to avoid the ostentation of art with regard to light and shadow
on which Rembrandt so much wished to draw the attention however each
of them ran into contrary extremes and it is difficult to determine
which is the most reprehensible both being equally distant from the
demands of nature and the purposes of art

This unity is observable in the composition of Rembrandt even where
a multiplicity of figures are employed they are so grouped that the
masses of light and shade are interrupted as little as possible and it
is only in his earlier works such as those now in the Munich Gallery
where this isolated light is carried to extravagance In many of his
later pictures we have not only subordinate groups but a repetition
of the principal lights also a greater breadth of half-tint
Composition says Reynolds which is the principal part of the
invention of a painter is by far the greatest difficulty he has to
encounter Every man that can paint at all can execute individual
parts but to keep these parts in due subordination as relative to a
whole requires a comprehensive view of the art that more strongly
implies genius than perhaps any other quality whatever Now Rembrandt
possessed this power in an eminent degree At the revival of painting
in Italy the compositions consisted entirely of subjects taken from
Sacred Writ subjects that imposed a purity of thought and a primitive
simplicity upon the artists these qualities were however in a great
measure lost in passing through the Venetian and German schools where
either the love for pictorial effect or the introduction of catholic
ceremonies took precedence of every other arrangement The prolific
genius of Rubens spread this infectious mode of treatment through
Flanders and Holland till at length in the hands of the painters of
smoking and drinking scenes historical subjects even of a sacred
character became quite ridiculous Yet with all these examples of bad
and vulgar taste around him we find many compositions of Rembrandt less
degraded by mean representation than many of the best of the works of
the Venetian and Flemish painters Take for example his design of
Christ and his Disciples at Emmaus the principal figure in which is
certainly more refined than the Christ either in the pictures of Titian
or Rubens of the same subject in fact the idea of it is taken from the
Last Supper by Raffaelle the Mark Antonio print of which he must have
had Raffaelle is indebted for the figure to Leonardo da Vinci and if
we were to trace back I have no doubt we should find that the Milanese
borrowed it from an earlier master indeed we perceive in the progress
of painting much of the primitive simplicity and uniformity preserved
in the best works of the Italian school It was only when composition
passed through the prolific minds of such artists as Paul Veronese
Tintoret and Rubens that it was made subservient to the bustle
animation and picturesque effect of their works When we find
therefore any remains revived in the pictures of Rembrandt who was
surrounded by compositions of a vulgar and low cast we can only ascribe
it to the taste and genius of this great painter In the design just
mentioned the idea of the Disciples as if struck with astonishment
and awe at the bursting forth of the divinity of Christ is admirably
conceived As the heads are taken from the people of his country they
of necessity partake of the character of the people This cannot be
justified though it is excusable Reynolds on this head speaking
of the ennobling of the characters in an historical picture says
How much the great style exacts from its professors to conceive and
represent their subjects in a poetical manner not confined to mere
matter of fact may be seen in the Cartoons of Raffaelle In all the
pictures in which the painter has represented the apostles he has
drawn them with great nobleness he has given them as much dignity as
the human figure is capable of receiving Yet we are expressly told in
Scripture they had no such respectable appearance and of St Paul
in particular we are told by himself that his bodily presence was
mean In conformity to custom I call this part of the art History
Painting it ought to be called Poetical as in reality it is He
further adds The painter has no other means of giving an idea of the
mind but by that external appearance which grandeur of thought does
generally though not always impress on the countenance and by that
correspondence of figure to sentiment and situation which all men wish
but cannot command As I cannot defend the mean appearance of the
disciples neither shall I exculpate our great artist from blame in
introducing a dog into so grand a subject we can only excuse him on
the plea of following the practice of his predecessors Titian in his
celebrated picture has not only introduced a dog but a cat also which
is quarrelling with the former for a bone under the table To this love
for the introduction of animals into their compositions for the sake of
picturesque variety many of the greatest painters must plead guilty
and though the incongruity has been pointed out over and over again by
the writers on art it is still clung to as means of contrast with the
human figure In one of the sketches by the late Sir D Wilkie for his
picture of Finding the Body of Tippoo Saib he had introduced two
dogs and only obliterated them when informed that dogs were considered
unclean by the people of the east and therefore it was an impossibility
for them to be in the palace of Seringapatam While I am upon this
subject it may not be amiss to refer to one of the authorities who
censures this practice Fresnoy says in his poem on the Art of
Painting

  Nec quod inane nihil facit ad rem sive videtur
   Improprium miniméque urgens potiora tenebit
   Ornamenta operis

  Nor paint conspicuous on the foremost plain
   Whate'er is false impertinent or vain

On this rule Reynolds remarks This precept so obvious to common
sense appears superfluous till we recollect that some of the greatest
painters have been guilty of a breach of it for not to mention Paul
Veronese or Rubens whose principles as ornamental painters would allow
great latitude in introducing animals or whatever they might think
necessary to contrast or make the composition more picturesque we can
no longer wonder why the poet has thought it worth setting a guard
against this impropriety when we find that such men as Raffaelle and
the Caracci in their greatest and most serious works have introduced
on the foreground mean and frivolous circumstances Such improprieties
to do justice to the more modern painters are seldom found in their
works The only excuse that can be made for those great artists is
their living in an age when it was the custom to mix the ludicrous with
the serious and when poetry as well as painting gave in to this
fashion

Many of the compositions of Rembrandt indicate not only a refined
taste but the greatest sensibility and feeling For example the small
etchings of the Burial of Christ and the Return from Jerusalem
these from their slightness may lay me under the same category as the
old Greek who having a house to sell carried in his pocket one of the
bricks as a sample yet being his own indications I have given them
It is worth while to compare the Entombment with the same subject by
Raffaelle in the Crozat Collection The whole arrangement is treated in
the finest taste of the Italian school The other design has been always
a favourite with the admirers of Rembrandt The feeling character of the
youthful Saviour is admirably portrayed Holding his mother's hand he
is cheering her on her tiring journey looking in her face with an
expression of affection and solace while she is represented with
downcast eyes fatigued and pondering in her mind the import of the
words he had addressed to her How is it that ye sought me wist ye not
that I must be about my Father's business And even here we can almost
excuse the introduction of the little dog who running before the
group is looking back giving a bark of joy at their having found the
object of their solicitude The background is conceived in the finest
spirit of Titian

These are the touches of nature that like the expressions of our own
immortal Shakspere however slight and though dressed in modern garb or
familiar language reach the innermost sensibilities of the human heart

The character and costume of the people as well as the scenery of those
subjects taken from Holy Writ have been a matter of investigation both
by artists and writers upon art for although the events related in the
New Testament are not of so ancient a date as those of the heathen
writers yet the mind seems to require that the style should be neither
classic nor too strictly local Hence though the costume represented in
the Venetian pictures is no doubt nearer the truth than that made use of
by Raffaelle and other Italians it fails to carry us back to ancient
and primitive simplicity The early pictures delineating Christian
subjects are modelled upon Greek forms and dresses and having been
made the foundation of those works afterwards produced by the great
restorers of painting have gained a hold upon our ideas which if not
impossible is yet difficult to throw off As the late Sir David Wilkie
travelled into the East with the express purpose of painting the
subjects mentioned in Scripture in more strict accordance with the
people and their habits it may be of advantage to give the student his
opinions In his Journal he says After seeing with great attention
the city of Jerusalem and the district of Syria that extends from Jaffa
to the river Jordan I am satisfied it still presents a new field for
the genius of Scripture painting to work upon It is true the great
Italian painters have created an art the highest of its kind peculiar
to the subjects of sacred history and in some of their examples
whether from facility of inquiry or from imagination have come very
near all the view of Syria could supply The Venetians perhaps
from their intercourse with Cyprus and the Levant Titian Paul
Veronese and Sebastian del Piombo have in their pictures given
the nearest appearance to a Syrian people Michael Angelo too from
his generalizing style has brought some of his prophets and sybils
to resemble the old Jews about the streets of the Holy City but in
general though the aspect of Nature will sometimes recall the finest
ideas of Leonardo da Vinci and Raffaelle yet these masters still want
much that could be supplied here and have a great deal of matters quite
contrary to what the country could furnish These contrarieties indeed
are so great that in discussions with the learned here I find a
disposition to that kind of change that would soon set aside the whole
system of Italian and European art but as these changes go too much
upon the supposition that the manners of Scripture are precisely
represented by the present race in Syria it is too sweeping to be borne
out by what we actually know At the same time there are so many
objects in this country so perfectly described so incapable of change
and that give such an air of truth to the local allusions of Sacred
Writ that one can scarcely imagine that these had they been known to
the painters of Italy would not have added to the impressive power of
their works Without trying to take from the grand impression produced
by the reading of the Sacred Writings it may be said that from its
nature many things must be confined to narrative to description to
precept and these are no doubt so strong as to supply to a pious mind
everything that can be desired but if these are to be represented as
certainly they have been by those of an art who have not seen Syria it
is clear some other country Italy Spain or Flanders will be drawn
upon to supply this and the reader of Scripture and the admirer of art
will be alike deluded by the representation of a strange country in the
place of that so selected and so identified as the Land of Promise so
well known and so graphically described from the first to the last of
the inspired writers

These remarks are certainly applicable but only in a degree What
is quoted from Reynolds in a former part shows that a licence is
indispensable and yet without destroying the apparent truth of the
subject many things are now established that without their being
facts have taken such hold of our ideas that they cannot with safety be
departed from I may instance the countenances of our Saviour and the
Virgin as given by Raffaelle and Coreggio we recognise them as if they
had been painted from the persons themselves I may also add the heads
of the Apostles With regard to the scenery many circumstances may
certainly be taken advantage of always guarding against a topographical
appearance that by its locality may prevent the work leading the
spectator back into distant periods of time Before quitting this part
of the subject which refers to Rembrandt's powers of composition I may
notice one or two of his designs which stamp him as a great genius in
this department of the art viz his Christ Healing the Sick Haman
and Mordecai the Ecce Homo Christ Preaching and the Death of
the Virgin




CHIARO-SCURO


From the position we are now placed in surrounded by the accumulated
talent of many centuries it is easy to take a retrospective view of
the progress of art and it is only by so doing that we can arrive at
a just estimate of the great artists who advanced it beyond the age
in which they lived and this seems mainly to have been achieved by
a close observance of nature As in philosophy the genius of Bacon
by investigating the phenomena of visible objects put to flight
and dissipated the learned dogmas of the school of Aristotle so in
sculpture the purity and simplicity of the forms of Phidias established
a line of demarcation between his own works and those of the formal
symmetrical and dry sculpture of his predecessors Sculpture till
then lay fettered and bound up in the severity of Egyptian
Hieroglyphics Likewise we perceive the genius of Michael Angelo and
Raffaelle setting aside the stiffness and profile character existing
in the works of Signorelli and Masaccio In Venice Titian emancipated
the arts from the grasp of Giovanni Bellini In Germany Rubens must
be considered the great translator of art out of a dead language into
a living one to use a metaphor and into one that like music is
universal Previous to Rembrandt the pupils of Rubens had thrown off
every affinity not only to Gothic stiffness but even to that degree
of regularity of composition which all classes of historical subjects
require Independent of Rubens and his pupils we find Rembrandt was
aware of the great advances made in natural representations of objects
by Adrian Brauwer several of whose works by the catalogue given of
his effects were in his possession therefore as far as transparency
and richness with a truthfulness of tint are concerned Brauwer had
set an example But in the works of Rembrandt we perceive a peculiarity
entirely his own that of enveloping parts in beautiful obscurity and
the light again emerging from the shadow like the softness of moonlight
partially seen through demi-transparent clouds and leaving large
masses of undefined objects in darkness This principle he applied to
compositions of even a complicated character and their bustle and noise
were swallowed up in the stillness of shadow If breadth constitutes
grandeur Rembrandt's works are exemplifications of mysterious sublimity
to the fullest extent This darkness visible as Milton expresses it
belongs to the great founder of the school of Holland and to him alone
Flinck Dietricy De Guelder and others his pupils give no idea of it
their works are warm but they are without redeeming cool tints they
are yellow without pearly tones and in place of leading the eye of the
spectator into the depths of aërial perspective the whole work appears
on the surface of the panel There are none of those shadows hanging
in mid air which constitute so captivating a charm in the great
magician of chiaro-scuro not only are objects of solidity surrounded
by softening obscurity but the contiguous atmosphere gives indications
of the influence of the light and shade To these principles the art
is indebted for breadth and fulness of effect which constitute the
distinct characteristics between the early state and its maturity and
to Rembrandt we owe the perfection of this fascinating quality

We must nevertheless always look back with wonder at what was
achieved by Coreggio Even when painting flourished under the guidance
of Leonardo da Vinci and Giorgione Reynolds speaking of this quality
in contradistinction to that of relief says This favourite quality
of giving objects relief and which De Piles and all the critics have
considered as a requisite of the greatest importance was not one of
those objects which much engaged the attention of Titian Painters of an
inferior rank have far exceeded him in producing this effect This was a
great object of attention when art was in its infant state as it is at
present with the vulgar and ignorant who feel the highest satisfaction
in seeing a figure which as they say looks as if they could walk round
it But however low I might rate this pleasure of deception I should
not oppose it did it not oppose itself to a quality of a much higher
kind by counteracting entirely that fulness of manner which is so
difficult to express in words but which is found in perfection in the
best works of Coreggio and we may add of Rembrandt This effect is
produced by melting and losing the shadows in a ground still darker
than those shadows whereas that relief is produced by opposing and
separating the ground from the figure either by light or shadow
or colour This conduct of inlaying as it may be called figures on
their ground in order to produce relief was the practice of the old
painters such as Andrea Mantegna Pietro Perugino and Albert Durer
and to these we may add the first manner of Leonardo da Vinci
Giorgione and even Coreggio but these three were among the first
who began to correct themselves in dryness of style by no longer
considering relief as a principal object As those two qualities
relief and fulness of effect can hardly exist together it is not
very difficult to determine to which we ought to give the preference
An artist is obliged for ever to hold a balance in his hand by which
he must determine the value of different qualities that when some fault
must be committed he may choose the least Those painters who have
best understood the art of producing a good effect have adopted one
principle that seems perfectly conformable to reason that a part may be
sacrificed for the good of the whole Thus whether the masses consist
of light or shadow it is necessary that they should be compact and
of a pleasing shape to this end some parts may be made darker and
some lighter and reflections stronger than nature would warrant Paul
Veronese took great liberties of this kind It is said that being once
asked why certain figures were painted in shade as no cause was seen in
the picture itself he turned off the inquiry by answering 'Una nuevola
che passa' a cloud is passing which has overshadowed them

Before entering more minutely into an investigation of the principles
of Rembrandt with regard to chiaro-scuro I must again revert to those
of Coreggio Opie speaking of the method of this great artist says
To describe his practice will be in a great degree to repeat my
observations on chiaro-scuro in its enlarged sense By classing his
colours and judiciously dividing them into few and large masses of
bright and obscure gently rounding off his light and passing by
almost imperceptible degrees through pellucid demi-tints and warm
reflections into broad deep and transparent shade he artfully
connected the finest extremes of light and shadow harmonized the most
intense opposition of colours and combined the greatest possible effect
with the sweetest and softest repose imaginable Further on he
remarks The turn of his thoughts also in regard to particular
subjects was often in the highest degree poetical and uncommon of
which it will be sufficient to give as an instance his celebrated
Notte or painting of the 'Nativity of Christ' in which his making
all the light of the picture emanate from the child striking upwards
on the beautiful face of the mother and in all directions on the
surrounding objects may challenge comparison with any invention in the
whole circle of art both for the splendour and sweetness of effect
which nothing can exceed and for its happy appropriation to the person
of Him who was born to dispel the clouds of ignorance and diffuse the
light of truth over a darkened world! Now this work Rembrandt must
have seen or at least a copy from it as his treatment of the same
subject in the National Gallery indicates but the poetry is lost for
it would be impossible to imitate it without a direct plagiarism It
may however have given a turn to his thoughts in representing many of
his subjects under the influence of night in place of day such as his
Taking down from the Cross by torch light his Flight into Egypt
with the lantern the Burial of Christ &c While other men were
painting daylight he turned the day into night which is one of the
paths that sublimity travels through The general idea most people have
of Rembrandt is that he is one of the dark masters but his shadows
are not black they are filled with transparency The backgrounds to his
portraits are less dark than many of either Titian or Tintoret His
landscapes are not black they are the soft emanations of twilight and
when he leads you through the shadows of night you see the path even
in the deepest obscurity As colour forms a constituent part of
chiaro-scuro I must in this division confine myself more particularly
to black and white both in giving examples from his etchings and
explaining the various changes he made upon them in order to heighten
the effect The etching I have here given is the Nativity in the
darkest state in the British Museum there are no less than seven
varieties and the first state is the lightest But in order to render
his mode of proceeding more intelligible I shall explain the progress
of his working His first etchings are often bit in with the aquafortis
when the shadows have but few ways crossed with the etching point these
are often strongly bit in that when covered over with finer lines the
first may shine through and give transparency In the next process he
seems to have taken off the etching ground and laid over the plate a
transparent ground that is to say one not darkened by the smoke of a
candle upon this he worked up his effect by a multiplicity of fresh
lines often altering his forms and adding new objects as the idea
seemed to rise in his mind After which when the plate was again
subjected to the operation of the acid the etching ground was removed
and the whole worked up with the greatest delicacy and softness by means
of the dry needle to the scratches of which the aquafortis is never
applied This process it is that gives what is termed the burr and
renders the etchings of Rembrandt different from all others Now this
burr is produced not by the ink going into the lines but by the
printer being obstructed in wiping it off by the raised edge which the
dry point has forced up for when these lines run through deep shadows
we often see that they print white from the ink being wiped off the
top of the ridge

Illustration THE NATIVITY

This is the foundation of what is called mezzotint engraving which
I shall notice in another place By keeping these remarks in mind
we shall easily perceive how it is that so many variations occur in
impressions from his plates depending entirely on the direction in
which the printer wiped off the ink whether across the ridges or in
the same direction as the lines Varieties have also arisen from these
ridges wearing away by the friction of the hand and as Rembrandt's
copper plates judging from those I have examined were soft they soon
wore down We also find this dark effect given in many of his varieties
by merely leaving the surface partially wiped and touching out the high
lights with his finger or a piece of leather These impressions must
have been taken by himself or at least under his superintendence
Several of his plates are worked on with the graver such as his Taking
down from the Cross but that evidently is by the hand of an engraver
We see the same in several of the etchings of Vandyke but their value
decreases as the finishing extends

While we are upon the subject of his etchings it will perhaps be of
use to confine the conduct of his chiaro-scuro to his etchings alone as
his treatment is very different to what he adopted when he had colour
to deal with and in this respect he must have been influenced by the
example of Rubens and Vandyke proofs of all the engravings after whose
pictures we perceive he had in his possession In order that we may
more clearly understand the reason of many of his etchings remaining
unfinished in parts while other portions are worked up with the
greatest care I shall give an extract from the Journal of Sir Joshua
Reynolds when in Flanders In describing a picture in the Church of the
Recollets at Antwerp he says Over the altar of the choir is the
famous 'Crucifixion of Christ between two Thieves' by Rubens To give
animation to this subject he has chosen the point of time when an
executioner is piercing the side of Christ whilst another with a bar
of iron is breaking the limbs of one of the malefactors who in his
convulsive agony which his body admirably expresses has torn one of
his feet from the tree to which it was nailed The expression in the
action of this figure is wonderful The attitude of the other is more
composed and he looks at the dying Christ with a countenance perfectly
expressive of his penitence This figure is likewise admirable The
Virgin St John and Mary the wife of Cleophas are standing by with
great expression of grief and resignation whilst the Magdalen who is
at the feet of Christ and may be supposed to have been kissing his
feet looks at the horseman with the spear with a countenance of great
horror As the expression carries with it no grimace or contortion of
the features the beauty is not destroyed This is by far the most
beautiful profile I ever saw of Rubens or I think of any other
painter The excellence of its colouring is beyond expression To say
that she may be supposed to have been kissing Christ's feet may be
thought too refined a criticism but Rubens certainly intended to convey
that idea as appears by the disposition of her hands for they are
stretched out towards the executioner and one of them is before and one
behind the cross which gives an idea of their having been round it And
it must be remembered that she is generally represented as kissing the
feet of Christ it is her place and employment in those subjects The
good Centurion ought not to be forgotten who is leaning forward one
hand on the other resting on the mane of his horse while he looks at
Christ with great earnestness The genius of Rubens nowhere appears to
more advantage than here it is the most carefully finished picture of
all his works The whole is conducted with the most consummate art
The composition is bold and uncommon with circumstances which no other
painter had ever before thought of such as the breaking of the limbs
and the expression of the Magdalen to which we may add the disposition
of the three crosses which are placed perspectively in a very
picturesque manner the nearest bears the thief whose limbs they are
breaking the next the Christ whose figure is straighter than ordinary
as a contrast to the others and the furthermost the penitent thief
This produces a most interesting effect but it is what few but such a
daring genius as Rubens would have attempted It is here and in such
compositions that we properly see Rubens and not in little pictures of
Madonnas and Bambinos It appears that Rubens made some changes in this
picture after Bolswert had engraved it The horseman who is in the act
of piercing the side of Christ holds the spear according to the print
in a very tame manner with the back of the hand over the spear
grasping it with only three fingers the forefinger lying straight over
the spear whereas in the picture the back of the hand comes under
the spear and he grasps it with his whole force The other defect
which is remedied in the picture is the action of the executioner who
breaks the legs of the criminal in the print both of his hands are
over the bar of iron which makes a false action in the picture the
whole disposition is altered to the natural manner in which every person
holds a weapon which requires both hands the right is placed over and
the left under it This print was undoubtedly done under the inspection
of Rubens himself It may be worth observing that the keeping of the
masses of light in the print differs much from the picture this change
is not from inattention but design a different conduct is required in
a composition with colours from what ought to be followed when it is in
black and white only We have here the authority of this great master
of light and shadow that a print requires more and larger masses of
light than a picture In this picture the principal and the strongest
light is the body of Christ which is of a remarkably clear and bright
colour This is strongly opposed by the very brown complexion of the
thieves perhaps the opposition here is too violent who make no great
effect as to light the Virgin's outer drapery is dark blue and the
inner a dark purple and St John is in dark strong red No part of
these two figures is light in the picture but the head and hands of the
Virgin but in the print they make the principal mass of light of the
whole composition The engraver has certainly produced a fine effect
and I suspect it is as certain that if this change had not been made
it would have appeared a black and heavy print When Rubens thought it
necessary in the print to make a mass of light of the drapery of the
Virgin and St John it was likewise necessary that it should be of a
beautiful shape and be kept compact it therefore became necessary to
darken the whole figure of the Magdalen which in the picture is at
least as light as the body of Christ her head linen arms hair
and the feet of Christ make a mass as light as the body of Christ
It appears therefore that some parts are to be darkened as well as
other parts made lighter This consequently is a science which an
engraver ought well to understand before he can presume to venture on any
alteration from the picture he means to represent The same thing may be
remarked in many other prints by those engravers who were employed by
Rubens and Vandyke they always gave more light than they were warranted
by the picture a circumstance which may merit the attention of
engravers

As most of these engravings were made from studies in black and white
perhaps reduced from the picture by the engraver but certainly touched
on afterwards by the painters themselves they form a school for the
study of light and shade when deprived of colour In the etchings of
Rembrandt therefore we ought to bear in mind that splendour of effect
was what he aimed at and the means adopted by Rubens and Vandyke were
carried still further by the fearless master of chiaro-scuro Now
that the eye has been accustomed to engravings where the local colour
is rendered when we look over a folio of the works of Bolswert
Soutman Pontius and others of the Flemish engravers they appear
notwithstanding their overpowering depth and brilliancy unfinished
from the lights of the several coloured draperies and the flesh tones
being left white They also occasionally look spotty in effect from the
extreme strength of the shadows and black draperies In Rembrandt's
works these defects are avoided by finishing his darks with the
greatest care and softness while the figures in the light masses are
often left in mere outline the lights are also reduced in size as they
enter the shade while the darks in the light portions of his prints are
circumscribed to a mere point for the purpose of giving a balance and
solidity The shadows of the several objects likewise assume a greater
delicacy as they enter into the masses of light In these respects the
Hundred Guilder print is a striking example

As we are now considering light and shade when unaccompanied by colour
I may notice that those portions where the dark and light masses come in
contact are the places where both the rounding of the objects by making
out the forms and also the patching down the half-tint with visible
lines may be followed out with the greatest success as it prevents the
work being heavy in effect and also assists the passage of the light
into the shadow The quality of the lights and darks is flatness The
Flemish engravers seem to have been very particular in the method of
producing their shadow both with regard to the direction of the lines
and also their repetition their object seems to have been intenseness
of dark with transparency of execution In a conversation with Sir
Thomas Lawrence upon the subject of shadows his ideas were that they
ought to be as still as possible and that all the little sparkling
produced by the crossing of the lines ought to be extinguished or
softened down In painting his notions were that they ought to be kept
cool Without presuming to differ with so excellent an artist it is but
proper to mention that all the best engravers from the time of Bolswert
to our own are of a contrary opinion and our best colourists from
Coreggio to Rembrandt and from Rembrandt to Wilkie were diametrically
opposite in their practice As far as engraving is concerned it is but
fair to notice that Lawrence had Rembrandt on his side of whose works
he was a great admirer

Illustration DOCTOR FAUSTUS

I may appear to have dwelt too long upon this subject of engraving
but as the etchings of Rembrandt form so large a portion of his
popularity we cannot enter too minutely into the various sources of
their excellence I shall now proceed to describe the etching of Doctor
Faustus a copy of which I have given Some think that it represents
Fust the partner of Guttenburg who by his publication of Bibles in
Paris was looked upon by the people as a dealer in the black art The
papers hung up by the side of the window look like the sheets of his
letter-press and the diagram that attracts his attention and rouses
him from his desk indicates by words and symbols a connexion with Holy
Writ But the general opinion is that it is Dr John Faustus a German
physician in his study This Dr Faustus was supposed to have dealings
with familiar spirits one of which has raised this cabalistic vision
that enters the window with overwhelming splendour like the bursting
of a shell communicating its radiance to the head and breast of the
figure and descending by his variegated garment is extended in a
spread of light over the whole lower part of the composition The light
of the window being surrounded by a mass of dark receives intense
importance and is carried as far as the art can go It is also I may
observe rendered less harsh and cutting by its shining through the
papers at the side and by the interruption of the rays of the diagram
The light passing behind the figure and partially thrown upon a skull
gives an awe-striking appearance to the whole while the flat breadth of
light below is left intentionally with the objects in mere outline This
etching seems never to have been touched on from the first impressions
to the last the first state is dark with excess of burr the last is
merely the burr worn off

Before quitting this subject I wish to make a few remarks It has been
said by some of Rembrandt's biographers that he made alterations in his
prints for the sake of enhancing their value but we know by experience
that every alteration he made however it might be for the better
struck off a certain portion of its money value I believe his desire
to better the effect was the only incitement Many were improved by his
working upon them after the first proofs and many were deteriorated in
effect but every additional line at the least struck off a guilder
I have mentioned that in this etching the brilliancy of the light in the
window is enhanced by its being surrounded by a mass of dark but the
same advantage would have accrued from its extension by a mass of half
light as it would then have had a greater breadth of soft light This
subject was a great favourite with the late Sir David Wilkie and he
introduced this window in his picture of The School but this being
a light composition he treated it in the way I have mentioned above
It was a common practice with Wilkie to adopt some part of a celebrated
work as a point to work from and carry out his design upon this
suggestion The spectator by this means was drawn into a
predisposition of its excellence without knowing whence it had arisen
Thus in his John Knox Preaching there are many points of similarity
with the St Paul Preaching by Raffaelle I may also mention here
what we often perceive in the works of Rembrandt in place of having the
light hemmed in by a dark boundary it is spread out into a mass of
half-light and the same treatment is adopted with regard to his extreme
darks they communicate their properties to the surrounding ground
These qualities are the foundation of breadth and softness of effect

These observations may appear iterations of what has been mentioned
before but truths get strengthened by being placed in new positions
In dividing a work of this kind into portions it is difficult to give
a preference to any department especially with such an artist as
Rembrandt who was equally celebrated in all and I have only given
a priority to historical subjects as they hold a higher rank than
portraiture But his portraits are those productions of his pencil
which are most peculiar to himself

Illustration BURGOMASTER SIX




PORTRAIT OF THE BURGOMASTER SIX


This is the most finished and perfect of all the etchings of Rembrandt
and as it was done expressly for his friend and patron we can easily
imagine that the painter exerted himself to the utmost so as to render
it worthy of the subject I have been at some trouble to get an account
of the family of Jan Six but have gleaned little from those books
connected with the history of Holland During the war with England in
the reign of Charles the Second he was Secretary of State to the City
of Amsterdam and his family was afterwards connected with some of their
most celebrated men But what has rendered his name more famous than
intermarrying with the families of Van Tromp or De Ruyter is his
patronage of Rembrandt in the same way that Lord Southampton's name
is ennobled by his patronage of Shakspere We know he was devoted to
literature as well as the fine arts having left a tragedy on the story
of Medea a copy of which is mentioned in the catalogue of Rembrandt's
effects and an etching by the artist was prefixed to the work viz
the Marriage of Jason and Creusa the rare states of this print are
before the quotation of the Dutch verses underneath also the statue of
Juno is without the diadem which was afterwards added I have mentioned
that this portrait was a private plate in fact the copper is still
in the possession of the family In a sale which took place in     
for a division of the property among the various branches fourteen
impressions were sold but brought comparatively small prices from the
number to be contended for Two proofs however on India paper are
still in the portfolio of his descendants which in five years will it
is said be brought to the hammer as by that time the parties will be
of age These proofs will in all probability realize two hundred guineas
each The ease and natural attitude of the figure in this work are
admirable the intensity of the light with the delicacy and truth of
the reflected lights are rendered with the strong stamp of genius the
diffusion of the light also by means of the papers on the chair and
the few sparkling touches in the shadow completely take this etching
out of the catalogue of common portraiture The only work I can at
present think of that can be brought into competition with it is the
full-length portrait of Charles the First by Vandyke in the Queen's
Collection and which is rendered so familiar by Strange's admirable
engraving

In entering into an examination of the execution of this print it is
evident the whole effect is produced by means of the dry point which
must have been a work of great labour The best impressions are on India
paper and I perceive by referring to Gersaint's catalogue that at the
sale of the Burgomaster's property they only brought about eighteen
florins The next portrait amongst his etchings that at all approaches
to the Burgomaster is that of Old Haring which has always struck
me as one of the foundations for the style of Sir Joshua Reynolds in
portraiture A fine impression of this work on India paper is more
like Sir Joshua than many prints after his own pictures and with all
the high veneration I have for Reynolds I cannot omit noticing how
very ambiguously he frequently speaks of this great genius We know
his master Hudson had an excellent collection of Rembrandt's works
and therefore he must have been early imbued with their merits and
peculiarities This however we shall have a better opportunity of
noticing when we come to the treatment of colour The next etching
in excellence I should mention is the Portrait of John Lutma the
Goldsmith with the light background this was afterwards softened
down by the introduction of a window And here I must observe that
though he often had light backgrounds to his prints yet in his finished
pictures they were generally the reverse The etching of Ephraim Bonus
the Jewish Physician is also one of his most effective works the
introduction of the balustrade on which he leans descending the
staircase removes it from the ordinary level of mere portraiture
On the hand that rests upon the balustrade is a ring which in the
very rare impressions from its being done with the dry point prints
dark from the burr These are invaluable as in that state the whole
work has the fulness and richness of a picture A very large sum was
given for the impression of the print in this state now in the British
Museum in fact one hundred and sixty pounds though at the Verstolke
sale where this print was purchased the commission given amounted to
two hundred and fifty pounds but when we consider that the collection
in the British Museum is now the finest in existence no extra price
should be spared to complete the collection especially as these works
are foundations for the sure improvement of the fine arts in the
country The crown jewels are exhibited as a necessary appendage to the
rank of the nation but there the value stops now the works of art in
this country are not only valuable but intrinsically beneficial We
know that Charles the Second pawned the crown pearls to the Dutch for a
few thousands but our collection of Rembrandts would realize in Holland
at least ten thousand pounds This of course is a digression and is
merely mentioned here to show how absurd the hue and cry is that the
country is wasting money in purchasing a few specimens of fine art
The Portrait of Utenbogardus is also excellent and I may here notice
the large book which Rembrandt was so fond of introducing as a means
of a breadth of light and employment for his portraits Now to these
circumstances we are indebted for some of the finest works of both
Reynolds and Lawrence amongst many I might mention the large ledger in
Lawrence's Portraits of the Baring Family and Sir Joshua's picture of
the Dilettante Society and others No doubt we find these means of
making up a picture both in Raffaelle and Titian but it is rendered
more applicable to our own purposes when it is brought nearer to our own
times especially when translated by so great a genius as Rembrandt
The next fine work amongst his etchings is the Portrait of Cornelius
Silvius the head of which being delicately finished with the dry
needle is seldom seen very fine This also has a book and the hand
extended beyond the frame of the oval opening upon which it casts its
shadow This practice of representing objects nearer the eye than the
frame is certainly to be observed in some of the prints after Rubens and
others and has descended to several common prints in our own time but
ought not to be adopted as bordering too much upon that art which may
be designated as a sort of ad captandum vulgus display As we shall
speak more particularly of Rembrandt's portraits when colour is
investigated these works are merely mentioned as excellent specimens of
composition and chiaro-scuro I must not omit however to notice here
the great Coppenol the writing-master to the city of Amsterdam he
holds a pen and a sheet of paper in his hand and is looking at the
spectator with a look of intelligent observation The head and figure of
this work were perfected in the first instance before the background
was put in and in this state is exceedingly rare the one in the
British Museum is valued at five hundred guineas and was left amongst
other rare works in his collection by the Rev Mr Cracherode to the
public And here we ought to bear in mind when individuals contribute
so largely by their bequests to the country it is our bounden duty
to carry out their views by perfecting the various collections as
opportunities offer in the course of time which to them was impossible
In one of the impressions in the Museum in a finished state is
written in a large ornamental hand a commendation by Coppenol himself
wherein he says he does so to unite his name with that of the great
artist Rembrandt Van Ryn as by that means he knows he shall secure
immortality to himself The portrait however that is the most
powerful as well as the most rare is Van Tolling the Advocate The
effect both from the reflected light on the face and the fearless
masses of burr is more like a picture than a print and renders every
other etching comparatively tame From the chemical bottles at the side
and from the character of the gown in which he is dressed I am of
opinion that he was a physician The excellence of this work added to
its rarity has at all times produced large prices There are two states
of this print the first with an irregular beard the second with the
beard cut square also some additional work on the drapery &c but
what is worthy of remark is in both states it is exceedingly scarce
in fact there are but seven impressions known viz two in the
British Museum one in Mr Holford's collection one in Mr Hawkins'
in Amsterdam one in Paris one and one in the collection of Mr Rudge
I ought here to notice that the Van Tolling is one of the prints
bequeathed to the nation by the Rev Mr Cracherode and that at the
sale of the Hon Pole Carew's prints in      this valuable etching
was purchased for the late Baron Verstolke for two hundred and twenty
pounds

I shall now enter upon an investigation of the LANDSCAPES OF REMBRANDT
which equally with his portraits are quite peculiar to himself but
differing from all others not from any eccentricity of manner but from
their giving the real essence and character of the scene when denuded
of any trifling and extraneous matters Whatever Rembrandt touched was
impressed with the peculiar characteristics of his genius hence it is
that the smallest stroke in his etchings is pregnant with truth Though
painting belongs exclusively to no country but represents the natural
appearance of each still it is reserved for genius alone to be able to
perceive and place on canvas the essence as it were or great leading
features of the subject I am now more particularly speaking of
landscape scenery In all countries and climates there are peculiarities
of effect which however interesting to the traveller or a source of
investigation to the philosopher or man of science yet are necessarily
excluded from the recording pencil of the artist his appeal is to
mankind at large not to the isolated few who observe but one side of
the subject The true artist looks upon nature as the chameleon capable
of giving out any variety and yet all equally true hence it is that
the skies for example of Claude Salvator Rosa and Gaspar Poussin are
universally subordinate to the general effect of the picture These men
living in Italy were quite aware of the various prismatic effects
observable in sunset but were also convinced of the necessity of making
the sky subservient at least conducive to the breadth and harmony of
the picture It may be said that Titian and Tintoret embodied the deep
and intense blues of the Venetian atmosphere but we may remark that
their skies are always held in check by the deep reds and browns of the
draperies of their figures Let us now however turn our remarks more
immediately to Rembrandt and the scenery and effects observable in
Holland Any one conversant with the pictures of the Dutch school must
have observed peculiar features in the skies of Backhuysen Cuyp and
Rembrandt arising entirely from the localities of the scenes of their
several pictures My young friend E W Cooke long a resident in
Holland and a keen and observing artist remarked that the skies in the
pictures of Backhuysen though dark and inky were precisely what we see
now the deep Zuyder Sea swallowing up any refraction of light which
would otherwise have illuminated the clouds while the skies of Cuyp
receiving the coruscations arising from the meeting of the two rivers
the Meuse and the Waal the scenes of most of his pictures exhibit
that luminous reflection and unsteady appearance peculiar to his works
I mention these matters not to prove that these great observers of
nature followed implicitly what was presented to their observation
but to show that when even copying the peculiar character of natural
phenomena it was done with a strict reference to the harmony of their
works and made subservient to one great broad principle In a flat
country like Holland especially where a low horizontal line is chosen
we perceive a peculiar feature takes precedence of everything else that
is the quick diminution of those lines which run to the point of sight
whilst the lines running parallel with the base line of the picture
retain their length in a greater degree hence the accumulation of these
lines such as the division of fields &c gradually shade down the
distant parts of the landscape while the foreshortened lines assume
the appearance of so many spots or dark touches In Rembrandt we
perceive this character faithfully rendered and also assisted by his
judicious management the lines such as the banks of canals or roads
as they reach the foreground are strongly pronounced by either
bringing them in contact with strong light or giving them breadth and
force by enriching them with broken ground reeds or dark herbage The
objects that stand up such as trees &c are enlarged and darkened
as they approach the eye thus not only enabling them to keep their
situation but also to assist the perspective effect in the highest
degree His small landscape etchings illustrate these remarks and are
full of the touches of truth and nature and where objects are wanting
to give variety and interest he introduces masses of shadow or dark
clumps of trees leaving other parts in mere outline The love of his
art caused him to be always provided with the materials for drawing and
etching so that we have these transcripts of nature fresh from the
fountain head We know this from an anecdote mentioned by Daulby In
describing the etching of Six's Bridge in his catalogue he says
This plate was produced by an incident which deserves to be related
Rembrandt lived in great intimacy with the Burgomaster Six and was
frequently at his country seat One day when they were there together
the servant came to acquaint them that dinner was ready but as they
were sitting down to table they perceived that mustard was wanting
The Burgomaster immediately ordered his servant to go into the village
to buy some Rembrandt who knew the sluggishness of the Dutch servants
and when they answer austons a-coming they are half an hour before
they appear offered the Burgomaster a wager that he would etch a plate
before his man returned with the mustard Six accepted the wager and
Rembrandt who had always plates at hand ready varnished immediately
took one up and etched upon it the landscape which appeared from the
window of the parlour in which they were sitting The plate was finished
before the servant returned and Rembrandt won his wager The etching is
slight but it is a wonderful performance considering the circumstance
that produced it It is not wonderful on account of the rapidity with
which it was done but the genius and science that pervade every touch
not only in the general arrangement but in the judicious management of
the smallest darks they are all in the most effective situations When
the plate was bit in the name was left out it was afterwards added
with the dry point also a little shading was given to the hat of one
of the figures on the bridge which in the rare state is white I may
notice here that it was also Rembrandt's practice to sketch with the dry
point alone as several of his landscapes show this has a very rich
and full effect His most finished and striking landscape is perhaps the
etching of the Three Trees What I have said respecting his giving
force to those parts nearest the eye may be seen in the strong dark
under the platform of the mill which etching I have given as it has
always been considered the mill in which he was born but I believe it
is merely a mill of a picturesque character which he consequently
etched In the rare impressions the sky is much stained on the plate
towards the house and mill and I believe intentionally so as it
enables the subject to melt more softly into the background by the
outline being less harsh at least I found in my copy when the person
employed to clean the margin of the plate cleaned the stains in the sky
also that I had to restore them As it will be necessary to go over the
ground again with regard to Rembrandt's landscapes when we enter upon
an investigation of his principles of colour I shall now commence upon
that department fully conscious how high he stands as an artist in that
difficult branch of the art at the same time aware how feeble words
must be to express adequately the deep-toned richness of Rembrandt's
colouring

COLOUR


Perhaps if we can comprehend a species of coloured chiaro-scuro or
the addition of colour to the broad and soft principles of light and
shade we shall be able to form a clear perception of the effects of
Rembrandt's colouring Indistinctness of tint such as colours assume
under the influence of twilight is a strong characteristic of his
manner the shadows never so dark that a black or blue cannot tell
firmly in the midst of them with the total absence of all harshness
from the outlines of objects melting into their adjacent grounds
or assuming an importance after emerging from a mass of indefinite
corresponding hues As he has a mass of shadow with a mass of light so
he has an accumulation of warm colours in opposition to a congregation
of cold every combination introduced conducing to the great principles
of breadth When such is the plan upon which a work is laid down we can
easily perceive how powerfully the smallest touch of positive colour
will tell as in the midst of stillness a pin falling to the ground
will be heard Cuyp has this quality in a high degree only on another
scale a uniformity of unbroken tone and in masses of half-tint
only like a few sparkles of light touches dealt out with the most
parsimonious pencil producing a glitter like so many diamonds This
it is that prevents a work from being heavy for by their fewness they
require not the aid of black grounds to give them consequence and by
their being touched upon colours of the same quality they avoid the
appearance of harshness in fact the principles of these two great
artists were the same only from the general tone of Cuyp's pictures
being light his strong darks tell with great power and Rembrandt's
half tints being of a low tone his high lights become more forcible
I may here mention not only the breadth of Rembrandt's shadows
but their peculiar transparency and clearness loose in the handling
and filled with air and space whereas his lights are solid and
firm possessing not only the characteristics of nature in
distinctiveness but also in variety and though we see always on a
general principle light upon light and dark on a dark ground yet we
perceive inroads made upon each by their several antagonists hot and
cold colours darting into each other's provinces This practice is also
conducive to breadth for tints of different hues may be interspersed
both in the darks and lights provided they are of equal strength
with those adjoining them We may observe in Rembrandt that those
colours introduced into the shadows are more under the influence of
indistinctness while those in the light are brighter this is quite
a deviation from the Roman school where the colours are pronounced
so harshly as to set the influence of chiaro-scuro at defiance

Barry in his sixth lecture speaking of colours says The happy
effects of those sure and infallible principles of light and colour
which Rubens had so successfully disseminated in the Netherlands were
soon found in every department of art Landscapes portraits drolls
and even the dullest and most uninteresting objects of still life
possess irresistible charms and fascination from the magic of those
principles Rembrandt who it is said was never at Venice might
notwithstanding have seen without going out of his country many
pictures of the Venetian school Besides he was about thirty years
younger than Rubens whose works were a general object of study when
Rembrandt was forming himself But however it be there is no doubt
for the colouring and chiaro-scuro Rembrandt is one of the most able
artists that ever lived Nothing can exceed the beauty freshness and
vigour of his tints They have the same truth high relish and sapidity
as those of Titian Indeed they have the closest resemblance to the
hues of Titian when he had Giorgione most in view There is identically
the same attention to the relievo and force obtained by his strong
shadows and low deep tones and his chiaro-scuro though sometimes
too artificial is yet often particularly in contrasted subjects
productive of the most fascinating effects In the tones of Rembrandt
though we recognise the same richness and depth as in Giorgione and
Titian yet there is a suppleness and lifelike character in his flesh
unlike either both from his manner of handling and also his hot and
cold tints being less blended

The late Sir David Wilkie in one of his letters speaking of the death
of Sir Thomas Lawrence says I do not wonder at the impression made
among you in Rome by the death of Sir Thomas Lawrence here it
engrossed for a time every other pursuit One of the last remarks he
made to me indicated his extreme admiration of Sir Joshua Reynolds who
he thought had with Rembrandt carried the imitation of nature in
regard to colours further than any of the old masters In many of the
higher qualities of colour and chiaro-scuro Reynolds comes nearer to
Rembrandt than any other artist who has succeeded him

Reynolds in his lectures speaking of Gainsborough observes We
must not forget whilst we are on this subject to make some remarks
on his custom of painting by night which confirms what I have already
mentioned his great affection to his art since he could not amuse
himself in the evening by any other means so agreeable to himself I am
indeed much inclined to believe that it is a practice very advantageous
and improving to an artist for by this means he will acquire a new
and higher perception of what is great and beautiful in nature By
candlelight not only objects appear more beautiful but from their
being in a greater breadth of light and shadow as well as having a
greater breadth and uniformity of colour nature appears in a higher
style and even the flesh seems to take a higher and richer tone of
colour Judgment is to direct us in the use to be made of this method of
study but the method itself is I am very sure advantageous I have
often imagined that the two great colourists Titian and Coreggio
though I do not know that they painted by night formed their high
ideas of colouring from the effects of objects by this artificial light
But I am more assured that whoever attentively studies the first and
best manner of Guercino will be convinced that he either painted by this
light or formed his manner on this conception

How far Coreggio may have formed his principles upon the effects of
lamplight it is impossible to decide seeing that though his shadows
have great breadth yet his lights have more of a phosphorescent
character tinged as it were with the coolness of moonlight but
Titian has all the glow of this property or as Reynolds remarks as
if he painted with the sun shining into the room The Italian pictures
of Vandyke have much of this phosphorescent character whereas many of
those he painted in England have more of a daylight appearance With
regard to Rembrandt he seems to have regulated the entire scheme both
of his chiaro-scuro and colour on this foundation his many paintings
drawings and etchings of candlelight subjects show how much his taste
led to this class of art and his daylight pictures from the warmth of
colour and breadth of shadow proclaim the source from which he derived
the cause of their brilliancy and force From the light being tinged
with yellow the half-tone partakes of the same warmth which gives a
greenish tint even to his grey tones This conduct conveys an emanation
of the principal light passing over the more delicate shadows In his
daylight subjects it is not so the light being often comparatively
cool is allowed to extend its influence to the secondary lights and
then as it subsides into the shadow is led in by the dark being
lighted up by touches of red and brown thus the light touches in the
dark are warm though the high light and secondary are cool In Coreggio
we often find the shadows more hot than even in Rembrandt from his
principal light and secondary being more cool Rembrandt never allows
his lights even though comparatively cool to pass into the shadow
without a few touches of warm colour this was the practice of Rubens
to enrich as it were the debateable land When this principle of
painting candlelight subjects fell into the hands of his pupils the
harmony and colouring of the whole were lost or changed For example
Hoogstraten his pupil instructed Schalcken as did also Gerard Dow
but the candlelight pieces of Schalcken are hot and foxy without any
redeeming grey tones When he painted by candlelight he placed his
sitter in a dark room with a light while he painted in another
apartment having a hole cut through the door to communicate with his
sitter the consequence was the effect gave exactly what we see in
such cases a red dull treatment of colour We know these facts by an
anecdote told of William the Third When Schalcken was over in England
the King wished to sit to him for his portrait and hearing of his
celebrity in candlelight pieces wished it painted under that effect
The painter placed a light in his Majesty's hand and retired into the
outer room the candle guttering kept dropping on the King's hand
but being unwilling to disturb the artist the King held on while the
painter intent on his work proceeded without noticing it Many of our
English artists paint by gaslight but the tones of the flesh are not
benefited gas shedding a white cool light compared with lamplight

The practice of painting by candlelight originated neither with
Rembrandt nor Gainsborough in fact we find that all academies from
the time of Bacio Bandinelli to our own were always opened at night
both for the purposes of drawing and painting But these effects
generally remain where they originated and are seldom taken advantage
of without the walls the figure alone being considered without
reference to the background Tintoret was one of the first to apply the
principles to his practice Fuseli speaking of chiaro-scuro says The
nocturnal studies of Tintoret from models and artificial groups have
been celebrated those prepared in wax or clay he arranged raised
suspended to produce masses foreshortening and effect It was thence
he acquired that decision of chiaro-scuro unknown to more expanded
daylight by which he divided his bodies and those wings of obscurity
and light by which he separated the groups of his composition
though the mellowness of his eye nearly always instructed him to
connect the two extremes by something that partook of both as the
extremes themselves by the reflexes with the background or the
scenery The general rapidity of his process by which he baffled his
competitors and often overwhelmed himself did not indeed always
permit him to attend deliberately to this principle and often hurried
him into an abuse of practice which in the lights turned breadth into
mannered or insipid flatness and in the shadows into a total extinction
of parts Of all this he has in the schools of San Rollo and Marco given
the most unquestionable instances 'The Resurrection of Christ' and
'The Massacre of the Innocents' comprehend every charm by which
chiaro-scuro fascinates its votaries In the vision dewy dawn melts
into deep but pellucid shade itself sent or reflected by celestial
splendour and angelic hues whilst in the infant massacre of Bethlehem
alternate sheets of stormy light and agitated gloom dash horror on the
astonished eye

Rembrandt like Tintoret never destroyed the effective character
of his chiaro-scuro by the addition of his colour but made it a
main contributor to the general character of the subject hence that
undisturbed and engulphing breadth which pervades his works Fuseli
in the same lecture defends the Venetian school from being considered
as the ornamental school After selecting several of the pictures of
Titian as proofs of his grand and solemn specimens of colour he thus
proceeds But perhaps it is not to Titian but to Tintoret and Paul
Cagliari that the debaucheries of colour and blind submission to
fascinating tints the rage of scattering flowers to no purpose
are ascribed Let us select from Tintoret's most extensive work
in the Scuola of San Rocco the most extensive composition and his
acknowledged masterpiece 'The Crucifixion' and compare its tone with
that of Rubens and Rembrandt of the same subject What impression feels
he who for the first time casts a glance over the immense scenery of
that work a whole whose numberless parts are connected by a lowering
mournful minacious tone A general fearful silence hushes all around
the central figure of the Saviour suspended on the cross his fainting
mother and a group of male and female mourners at its foot a group of
colours that less imitate than rival nature and tinged by grief itself
a scale of tones for which even Titian offers me no parallel yet all
equally overcast by the lurid tone that stains the whole and like a
meteor hangs in the sickly air Whatever inequality or dereliction of
feeling whatever improprieties of commonplace of local and antique
costume the master's rapidity admitted to fill his space and they
are great all vanish in the power which compresses them into a single
point and we do not detect them till we recover from our terror

The picture of Rubens which we oppose to Tintoret was painted for the
Church of St Walburgha at Antwerp after his return from Italy and
has been minutely described and as exquisitely criticised by Reynolds
Christ he says is nailed to the cross with a number of figures
exerting themselves to raise it The invention of throwing the cross
obliquely from one corner of the picture to the other is finely
conceived something in the manner of Tintoret So far Reynolds In
Tintoret says Fuseli it is the cross of one of the criminals they
attempt to raise who casts his eye on Christ already raised The body
of Christ is the grandest in my opinion that Rubens ever painted
it seems to be imitated from the Torso of Apollonius and that of the
Laocoon How far it be characteristic of Christ or correspondent with
the situation I shall not here inquire my object is the ruling tone of
the whole and of this the criticism quoted says not a word though much
of local colour and grey and ochry balance Would so great a master of
tone as Reynolds have forgot this master-key if he had found it in the
picture The fact is the picture has no other than the painter's usual
tone Rubens came to his work with gay technic exultation and by the
magic of his pencil changed the horrors of Golgotha to an enchanted
garden and clusters of flowers Rembrandt though on a smaller scale
of size and composition concentrated the tremendous moment in one flash
of pallid light It breaks on the body of Christ shivers down his
limbs and vanishes on the armour of a crucifix the rest is gloom

This is given with all the eloquence Fuseli was so well able to utter
but it displays also a severe castigation on those who would class
Tintoret and Paul Veronese in the catalogue of ornamental painters
The observations which seem to have kindled his wrath are to be found
in Sir Joshua's fourth lecture in which he says Tintoret Paul
Veronese and others of the Venetian school seem to have painted with
no other purpose than to be admired for their skill and experience in
the mechanism of painting and to make a parade of that art which as I
before observed the higher style requires its followers to conceal
But to understand the matter the whole lecture must be read With
regard to the two pictures Fuseli brings into comparison with the
Venetian both are described in Reynolds' Tour to Flanders and Holland
Sir Joshua certainly criticizes the Rubens correctly with regard to
colouring but sentiment it has none The Rembrandt is now in the Munich
Gallery and though one of his early pictures it is very grand and
striking Of it Reynolds remarks There are likewise in this room eight
Rembrandts the chief merit of which consists in his peculiarity of
manner of admitting but little light and giving to that little a
wonderful brilliancy The colouring of Christ in the elevation of the
cross cannot be exceeded it is exactly the tint of Vandyke's 'Susanna'
in the other room but whether the ground of this picture has been
repainted or the white horse which was certainly intended to make the
mass of light broader has lost its brightness at present the Christ
makes a disagreeable mass of light

In bringing the opinions of these two great artists in contact the
truth is elicited that the tone of colour has much to do in conveying
the sentiment and pathos of the picture and Rembrandt possessed this
quality in a very high degree In the infancy of the arts when
practised by rude nations we find harsh and bright colours predominate
in a very strong scale in fact the brighter the more effective on the
uneducated eye and it is only when the arts advance towards perfection
that a subdued tone of colour is demanded as most compatible with
refinement Colour both as an imitative quality and also as an adjunct
towards assisting the character of his subject seems always to have
been uppermost in Rembrandt's mind His drawing it is true is open to
censure but his colour will stand the most searching investigation and
will always appear more transcendent the more it is examined Reynolds
in his Journey through Holland mentions a picture by Rembrandt in
the collection of the Prince of Orange a study of a Susanna for the
picture by Rembrandt which is in my possession it is nearly the same
action except that she is here sitting This is the third study I
have seen for this figure I have one myself and the third was in the
possession of the late Mr Blackwood In the drawing which he made for
this picture which I have she is likewise sitting in the picture
she is on her legs but leaning forward It appears extraordinary that
Rembrandt should have taken so much pains and have made at last so
very ugly and ill-favoured a figure but his attention was principally
directed to the colouring and effect in which it must be acknowledged
he has attained the highest degree of excellence The small picture
in the National Gallery is a study of the same figure Colour was the
ruling principle with Rembrandt the Alpha and Omega in the same way
that Richard Wilson designated the three qualifications for landscape
painting as contained in one viz breadth The tones of colour with
which Rembrandt clothed his subjects are always in the highest degree
appropriate and conducive to the sentiment whether within the solemn
temples or the personification of some great supernatural event As
most of his historical subjects are from Sacred Writ he never loses
sight of those qualities which take them out of the page of every-day
occurrences I shall mention two though one is sufficient for a
master-key to them all In the picture of The Adoration of the Magi
and Kings in the Queen's Collection the solemnity is carried to the
utmost extent like the mysterious leaf of a sybil's book the only
light shed over the scene seems to descend from the lurid rays of the
star that stood over the place of the nativity and guided them to the
spot To acquire the greatest breadth he has placed the Virgin and
child in the corner of the picture and low down at the base with the
same feeling that impelled Shakspere in his Constance to utter Here
is my throne bid kings come bow to it The presentation of incense
and precious perfumes of diadems and jewels by crowned heads and
venerable magi not only removes the attendants to the background but
even Joseph is represented as wrapt in thought and viewing from the
shade the solemnity of the scene The whole colouring of this work is in
accordance with this feeling subdued except in the smallest portions
of each hue and these shine out like sparkling of jewels in a dark
recess

The other work I would particularize is The Salutation of the Virgin
in the collection of the Marquis of Westminster This picture though
of small dimensions yet exemplifies the peculiarity of Rembrandt's mode
of treatment Being less decided in the chiaro-scuro and tone of colour
than the Wise Men's Offering it is more difficult to describe this
also arises from the exquisite weaving in of the hot and cold colours
Having had it under my eye for a couple of months I can easily recall
it on the least effort of the memory but to bring it before the
spectator who has not seen it and by no other art than the medium of
words is as difficult as it would be to bring an harmonious arrangement
of music by a different means one must be seen and the other heard to
render an explanation evident which even then can only be understood
by connoisseurs in painting and music I must therefore avail myself of
technicalities which may seem out of place where we are investigating
the general hue of the picture It is divided into hot and cold colours
which are brought in contact in the centre Elizabeth being clothed in
red and yellow the Virgin in blue white and cool grey The hot colour
is carried across by the red sleeve of Elizabeth and part of her
yellow shawl and descends to the petticoat of a Negress who is removing
the grey mantle from the Virgin and is further extended by a few
warm-coloured stones and touches in the pavement The cool colour is
carried past the warm tone of Zacharias and the porch above him by means
of a grey green pillar a peacock and a few touches of cool colour on a
bush at one corner of the warm side of the picture The general tone of
the work is of a low deep hue so that even the cool tints are not cold
or raw but a deep-toned brightness pervades the whole Through the dark
grey sky that seems to descend to overshadow the group a gleam of
light darts upon the scene as a connecting link between heaven and
earth and giving force and truth to the expression of Elizabeth when
she pronounces the words Blessed art thou among women and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb The light that shoots through the gloom has
roused a pea-hen and chicks who shake off their sleep as if it was the
dawn of day

This is a very imperfect description but will nevertheless serve
to show the fine feeling and deep intent of the genius of Rembrandt
To extend this investigation further would be perhaps superfluous
did we not know that even in our own time doubts are entertained of
the proper introduction of pictorial arrangements of chiaro-scuro and
colour but the grand style like all other modes of portraying a work
must be made subservient to affecting the feelings of the spectator I
shall only bring two pictures in contrast to elucidate this principle
still further The Burning of the Books at Ephesus by Sebastian
Bourdon and The Martyrdom of St Lawrence by Titian As Bourdon has
been considered the French Raffaelle it is but fair that he should be
taken as a follower of that school devoted to composition and correct
drawing to the absence of all inferior qualities the consequence is
he has represented the scene in mid-day where the flames are red
without extending their influence to surrounding objects consequently
they are not luminous nor conveying the idea of destruction Titian
on the contrary has chosen the darkness of night to represent the
horrors of the martyrdom the red burning light of the living coal
conveys a tenfold force to the torments of the saint and the very
reality of the colour gives a corresponding truth to the scene which
takes it completely out of the regions of apocrypha and stamps it with
the character of Holy Writ The descent of the cool light from heaven
upon the scorching body of St Lawrence is like a rush of water to
counteract his sufferings and give him a confidence in his future
reward which the spectator fully enters into These are the triumphs
that appropriate chiaro-scuro and colour achieve for their introduction
into historical works

That we may more clearly perceive the rank which Rembrandt holds as a
colourist I shall endeavour to investigate the peculiar qualities that
characterise the several manners of Titian Rembrandt and Reynolds the
one living before the other after our artist and of course confining
the investigation to portraiture alone I have selected Titian in
preference to Vandyke not that I consider him in this branch
superior on the contrary I agree with Sir Joshua in mentioning
Vandyke as the greatest portrait painter that ever existed all things
considered but I wish to confine myself exclusively to colour and
in this branch it is evident that these three great artists are more
similar in their works than any other painters but Titian by the
concurrent testimony of his contemporaries and all succeeding judges
upon the subject is the highest authority on the great leading
principles of colour Besides his works are in many instances uninjured
by the rough usage of uneducated men With regard to the works of
Rembrandt which are in comparison as of yesterday many of them remain
in the same frames and on the same walls on which they were first hung
The works of Reynolds though of a more recent date have suffered more
not from the ruthless hand of the picture-cleaner but from his making
use of more perishable materials Still from the variety of his
vehicles changed from an anxiety to get a nearer approach to the look
and appearance of nature many of his pictures are sufficiently perfect
to build an investigation upon Previous to the appearance of Giorgione
and Titian this branch of the art differed but little from the
treatment the several heads received in historical pictures generally
only with this exception that when introduced as the component parts
of a work where a story had to be told they were imbued with action
and expression but when treated as simple portraiture the higher
qualities were left out and a quiet map of the face to use a familiar
expression was all that was desired to be transferred to the canvas
Neither did the head receive that superiority over every other
subordinate part of the work which science and a long line of celebrated
examples seem now so imperatively to demand

In drawing a comparison between the three great portrait painters it
is necessary in the first instance to refer to the several characters
of their models or sitters The nobility of Venice were at the time
of Titian men of long descent dignified and holding high rank in
a city at that time the emporium of the merchandize of the East and
distributors of rich manufactures to the whole of civilized Europe
hence that senatorial dignity which characterises his works and
the style and richness of costume so necessary to grandeur and the
historical air in his portraits His sitters also possessed countenance
and figure well calculated to engender and support the noblest character
of painting The sitters of Reynolds notwithstanding the pomatumed
pyramids of the female hair or the stiff formal curls of the male
which set every attempt to beautify the features at defiance either
by extension of the forms or harmonizing the several parts of the
countenance serious obstacles to pictorial beauty were still in
possession of that bland and fascinating look which distinguishes people
of high breeding In contrast with these we have to array the models of
Rembrandt's painting-room fat burgomasters florid in complexion and
common in feature Jews and attornies shipbuilders and hard
harsh-featured master mechanics Independent of the models themselves
there is a congenial feeling created in the artist who associates with
and has to represent them we imperceptibly imbibe the manners of those
we are in contact with either advantageously or injuriously From these
few remarks we may perceive that the dignified attitude the broad
general tone of the countenance though deep yet rendered bright
and luminous by the jetty blackness of the hair and beard were all
conducive to the creation of the style of Titian a style that swallows
up the varieties of minute tints in a general breadth So in Reynolds
the absence of everything strong in expression or harsh in colour gave
a refinement to the heads of his men and a beauty to the faces of his
females and to this treatment all his sitters were subjected so that
even those heads however deficient in the originals came off his
easel ladies and gentlemen A subdued delicacy of expression and
colour removes them from the common look of familiar life Now on
the contrary the very character and colour of Rembrandt's heads
are pronounced with the strong stamp of flesh and blood an exact
representation of nature in an unsophisticated state His handling his
manner of leaving the various tints and the marking of minute parts
all conspire to give his works that appearance of truth unfettered
with the attempt to elevate the general character at the expense of
individuality

The peculiarity of Titian's portraits independent of the high character
and simple and dignified attitude of the figure is a careful and
distinct modelling of the features with the half-shadows though
not dark yet never slurred over which in other hands would produce
heaviness but Titian counteracts this by the intense darkness of his
dresses and backgrounds so that the features often modelled with
the firmness of sculpture are rendered comparatively gentle by the
treatment of the other parts of the picture The portraits of Sir Joshua
have this peculiarity that however loaded and enriched in every part of
the work the head is kept smooth and often thinly painted The
whole-length of The Marquis of Granby and The Portrait of Mrs
Siddons two of his finest pictures are examples of this mode of
treating the head This has given rise to an anecdote that Mrs
Siddons looking at the picture when unfinished begged Sir Joshua not
to touch the head any more and having promised her he refrained
notwithstanding the richness and depth of the fearless glazings would
seem to demand a corresponding force in the head The truth is that
Reynolds seems always to have depended upon the small dark shadows
to give solidity to his heads without clogging them with colour or
dark half-tints The importance of thus refining upon the head may be
perceived in the portrait of himself painted con amore and presented
to the Dilettante Society of which he was a member The features and
indeed the whole head depend upon the extreme darks the judicious
arrangement of these shadows not only gives a pictorial dignity to the
work from the stamp of science but also where the features in nature
are either blunt or mean in themselves draws off the attention of the
spectator to higher qualities Shadows are never mean but are the
stamps of truth rendered beautiful by taste and feeling Independent
of the advantage of dark touches giving delicacy to the features that
produce them there is a motion and life given by the vivacity and
freedom of the handling which cannot with safety be taken with the
features themselves This quality seems very early to have been Sir
Joshua's greatest anxiety to acquire In a remark respecting the
pictures of a rival John Stephen Liotard whose only merit was a
strong likeness with great neatness of finish Reynolds says The
high-finished manner of painting would be chosen if it were possible
with it to have that spirit and expression which infallibly fly off when
the artist labours but there are transient beauties which last less
than a moment and must be painted in as little time besides in poring
long the imagination is fatigued and loses its vigour You will find
nature in the first manner but it will be nature stupid and without
action The portraits of Holbein are of this high-finished manner and
for colouring and similitude what was ever beyond them But then you see
fixed countenances and all the features seem to remain immoveable

Northcote observes Of mere likeness in portraiture Reynolds thought
very little and used to say that he could instruct any boy that chance
might throw in his way to paint a likeness in a portrait in half a
year's time but to give an impressive and a just expression and
character to a picture or paint it like Velasquez was another thing
What we are all he said attempting to do with great labour he does
at once

Barry speaking of Reynolds as a portrait painter mentions the wretched
state the art was in before his time and how elevated it became from
the manner Sir Joshua treated it In continuation he says In many of
Titian's portraits the head and hands are mere staring lightish spots
unconnected with either the drapery or background which are sometimes
too dark and mere obscure nothings and in Lely and even in Vandyke
we sometimes meet with the other extreme of too little solidity too
much flickering and washiness Sir Joshua's object appears to have been
to obtain the vigour and solidity of the one with the bustle and spirit
of the other without the excess of either and in by far the greatest
number of his portraits he has admirably succeeded His portrait of
Mrs Siddons is both for the ideal and the executive the finest
portrait of the kind perhaps in the world indeed it is something more
than a portrait and may serve to give an excellent idea of what an
enthusiastic mind is apt to conceive of those pictures of confined
history for which Apelles was so celebrated by the ancient writers
But this picture of 'Mrs Siddons or the Tragic Muse' was painted not
long since when much of his attention had been turned to history and
it is highly probable that the picture of Lord Heathfield the glorious
defender of Gibraltar would have been of equal importance had it been
a whole length but even as it is only a bust there is great animation
and spirit happily adapted to the indications of the tremendous scene
around him and to the admirable circumstance of the key of the
fortress firmly grasped in his hand than which imagination cannot
conceive anything more ingenious and heroically characteristic It
is perhaps owing to the Academy and to his situation in it to
the discourses which he biennially made to the pupils upon the great
principles of historical art and the generous ardour of his own mind
to realize what he advised that we are indebted for a few expansive
efforts of colouring and chiaro-scuro which would do honour to the first
names in the records of art And speaking of the large historical work
he painted for the Empress of Russia he adds Nothing can exceed the
brilliancy of light the force and vigorous effect of his picture of
'The Infant Hercules strangling the Serpent' it possesses all that we
look for and are accustomed to admire in the works of Rembrandt united
to beautiful forms and an elevation of mind to which Rembrandt had no
pretensions The prophetical agitation of Tiresias and Juno enveloped
in clouds hanging over the scene like a black pestilence can never be
too much admired and are indeed truly sublime

After such commendations and from so high an authority we might feel
a diffidence in bringing forward the great founder of the Dutch school
in competition with such artists as Titian and Reynolds did we not
know that the qualities of the chiaro-scuro and colour of Reynolds are
founded on the deep tones of Rembrandt who as a colourist takes his
proper place between the two heads of the Venetian and English schools
How far Rembrandt was indebted for his principles of colour to the works
of Titian it is impossible to say but many of his pictures bear a
greater affinity to the last style of this great colourist than to any
other painter We perceive by the catalogue of his effects that folios
containing drawings by Titian also prints after him were in his
possession The luminous rich tones of his flesh are more like Titian
than Rubens or Vandyke whose works he must have been familiar with
and while his backgrounds are less black and inky than those in the
portraits of Titian and Tintoret they are also more broken both in
colour and execution which prevents heaviness His handling which
conveys from its dexterity and touch so lifelike an appearance is not
unlike that of Frank Hals of whom Reynolds speaks so highly In the
works of Frank Hals the portrait painter may observe the composition of
a face the features well put together as the painters express it from
whence proceeds that strong marked character of individual nature
which is so remarkable in his portraits and is not found in an equal
degree in any other painter If he had joined to this most difficult
part of the art a patience in finishing what he so correctly planned
he might justly have claimed the place which Vandyke all things
considered so justly holds as the first of portrait painters There
is however this difference in their works independent of the flesh
of Rembrandt's being much richer in tone it is produced by glazing and
fresh touches of transparent colour whereas the tints of Hals seem
to have been mixed in the first instance on his palette hence that
undisturbed dexterity of handling which gives so much the appearance
of life in his best works The distinctive characteristics between a
portrait painter and a historical painter is that the one paints man
in general the other a particular man hence to ennoble the work it
is necessary to make it conform as much as can be done with safety to
the likeness to the great principles that guide the highest branches
of the art that is by softening down those features that overstep the
boundary of general nature and assisting those parts that fall short
or are defective Therefore when Lawrence painted Mrs Siddons the
Duke of Wellington or Lord Brougham he chose a front view of the face
that their peculiarities might not be too apparent Now Sir Joshua
carried these generalizing principles to so great an extent at times
that his sitters did not recognise the striking likeness that some
people look for as paramount to all other considerations which made his
pupil Northcote remark that there was a class of sitters who would not
be content unless the house-dog barked at it as a sign of recognition
Rembrandt on the contrary did not generalize enough therefore many
portraits were left on his hands as it is said they were left on
Reynolds's But see the result those very pictures from the easel
of both painters bring higher prices than the more favoured of their
likenesses from being intrinsically fine works of art The number
of portraits Rembrandt painted of himself is a proof of the little
encouragement he received in painting the portraits of others From Sir
Joshua's hand we have but two or three while from Rembrandt's we have
nearly fifty Yet with all the deficiencies in the art of making up
a beautiful face Rembrandt frequently produced portraits of great
feminine beauty witness The Lady with the Fan in the collection of
the Marquis of Westminster and The Lady in the Royal Collection Had
he got the same models of female beauty that Titian and Reynolds had he
would in all probability have transferred them to the canvas with the
same truth and intenseness of feeling that guided his pencil in other
matters Rembrandt's style was that which would have suited Oliver
Cromwell who when he sat for his portrait made it a sine qua non
that the painter should leave out neither warts nor wrinkles The same
truth and verisimilitude that regulated his forms guided his eye with
respect to colour In his earlier pictures such as The Ship Builder
in the Royal Collection there is a greater degree of hardness and
solidity of pigment than in his later works which possess more the
suppleness of flesh This is also to be observed in the later works of
Titian Velasquez and Reynolds and in the later works of our Scottish
Velasquez Raeburn The portraits of Gainsborough possess this in a
high degree What has been said with regard to Rembrandt laying on his
colours with the palette-knife is very much exaggerated Many of his
heads are as smooth as Reynolds's and finished with great delicacy and
precision in fact the versatility of his genius and the wonderful
command over his materials from indefatigable practice have given both
his pictures and prints that character of having been done in the best
style suited to accomplish his object I have mentioned that Titian
keeps his backgrounds often dark for the purpose of giving a delicacy
to his strong shadows in the face both Vandyke and Rembrandt do this
by making the colour of the background amalgamate with the colour of
the hair or dark shades of the head Rubens Reynolds and Lawrence
often used a red curtain in contact with their flesh to produce the
same result The luminous character of the head is certainly better
preserved by its giving out rays or similarity of tone to the
surrounding background It has been remarked that the luminous and
transparent character of the flesh is enhanced as in several of
Vandyke's portraits by bringing it in contact with an earthy dull
tint Vandyke indeed when his ground would not permit him introduced
over the shoulders of his females a scarf of this colour Rembrandt
often plunges from the dark shadows of his head into his ground and
thus gives both a breadth and unity This practice where the shadows of
the face are produced by the same colour as the contiguous background
is certainly the foundation of simplicity

I think the money value of Rembrandt's portraits may be taken as a
criterion of their intrinsic worth as works of art other masters'
decline in producing high prices Rembrandt's increase witness
the portrait sold the other day at the Duke of Buckingham's at
Stowe though the half-length of a burgomaster whom few people ever
heard of it realized seven hundred guineas and upwards No nameless
portrait by Reynolds under the same disadvantages would produce an
equivalent sum Sir Joshua's portraits are either branches of our
aristocracy or celebrated public characters As a knowledge of art
advances works fall naturally into their proper stations When
Reynolds's sister asked Sir Joshua the reason that we never see any of
the portraits by Jervas now he replied Because my dear they are all
up in the garret Yet this man drove his chariot and four and received
the praises of Pope in verse Sir Godfrey Kneller would sometimes
receive a sum of money and a couple of portraits by Vandyke as payment
but now a single portrait of the great founder of the Dutch school
would outweigh in true value a large number of Kneller's collected
talent yet Rembrandt died insolvent and Sir Godfrey accumulated
a large fortune And such will be the fate of those who paint for
posterity and look beyond the ignorant present The true statement
of this change which of necessity takes place is that the man of
genius paints according to the high impulse that has been given him as
paramount to every other consideration the other panders to the caprice
and ignorance of those who employ him This it was that made Reynolds's
master Hudson exclaim after Sir Joshua's return from Italy Why
Joshua you don't paint so well as you did before you went abroad! When
men of genius and high talent fall upon favourable times the result
is the reverse and the fine arts are esteemed and their professors
rewarded according to their excellence The age in which Titian lived
was famous for literary men who had made the republic of Venice known
and honoured through the whole of Italy The praises of Michael Angelo
bestowed on the works of the great Venetian had adorned the name of
Titian with a halo of supernatural brightness so much so that whilst
painting the portrait of the Emperor Charles the Fifth happening to
drop one of his pencils Charles stooped and picked it up observing
that a genius like Titian deserved to be waited on by emperors Of
Reynolds we know that all the beauty and talent of the land flocked to
his painting-room conscious of being handed down to posterity with
all the advantages that pictorial science could achieve The grace
of Coreggio was grafted by this great master on the strong stem of
Rembrandt's colouring In opposition to those advantages we have to
remark that the people with whom Rembrandt came in contact were not
only of an inferior character when measured by the standard of grace
and dignity but the troubles of the times militated in a high degree
against that encouragement so necessary to the perfection of the art
In spite of these inauspicious circumstances the genius of Rembrandt
has produced works fraught with the highest principles of colour and
pictorial effect and to his want of encouragement in the department
of mere common portraiture we are indebted for many of the most
pictorial and splendid specimens of strong individual character in
familiar life

Of all the works by Rembrandt perhaps no picture has attracted so much
attention and observation as his Night Watch now in the Museum of
Amsterdam As its dimensions are thirteen feet by fourteen it secures
attention by its size its effect also is striking in a high degree
though Reynolds in his Tour to Holland and Flanders says it
disappointed him having heard so much respecting it He remarks that
it had more of the appearance of Ferdinand Bol from a prevalence of a
yellow sickly colour On the other hand Wilkie says Had it been a
subject such as 'The Christ before Pilate' which he has etched it
would have been his finest and grandest work Though painted in     
it possesses all the force and high principles of colour to be found in
his later works Nothing can exceed the firmness and truth of the two
figures advancing to the spectator especially the officer in the light
dress it is modelled with all the force of nature and the background
figures being steeped in the deepest hues of subdued colour give a
strength and richness which nothing can surpass Of course there is
a want of interest in the story which is merely an assemblage of the
Militia of Amsterdam on occasion of the expected visit of the Prince of
Orange and the daughter of Charles the First whom he had espoused The
principal pictures by other great masters receive a greater notoriety
from the interest of the subject such as The Transfiguration by
Raffaelle The Peter Martyr by Titian The Miracle of St Mark by
Tintoret The Martyrdom of St George by Paul Veronese and The St
Jerome by Coreggio Nevertheless The Night Watch by Rembrandt may
safely be classed with the choicest productions of the great painters of
Italy and Venice When we consider that his pictures extend to upwards
of six hundred and fifty the reader will appreciate the difficulty
I have felt in describing the peculiar merit which has so indelibly
stamped most of them with the passport to posterity




LANDSCAPES


The landscapes by Rembrandt unhappily few in number possess the
strong mark of truth for which his works are so strikingly fascinating
They are chiefly small the largest not exceeding three feet One of his
best is in the collection of the Marquis of Lansdowne representing a
mill seen under the influence of an uncertain twilight the warm light
of the western sky sheds its lustre on the sails of the mill which
stands on high ground but the other portions of the picture are of
dark half-tint except a reflection of the light on the water towards
the foreground It was exhibited in the British Gallery in      and
attracted great attention Another picture peculiar to the genius of
Rembrandt is in the collection of Sir Richard Colt Hoare Bart it
represents a night scene on the skirts of a wood with a group of
figures seated round a fire the red gleam of which is reflected in a
stream that flows along the foreground A few cattle are partially seen
in the obscure portions of the picture with a peasant passing with a
lantern Other smaller works are in the collections of Sir Robert Peel
Samuel Rogers Esq Sir Abraham Hume and the Marquis of Hertford His
largest picture of this class was formerly in the Louvre and is now in
the public gallery at Hesse-Cassel In the landscapes of Rembrandt we
meet with the same breadth and hues of a deep tone without being black
or heavy they are also painted with a full pencil and rich juicy
vehicle Rembrandt like Titian Rubens and others who were historical
painters seizes upon the great characteristics of nature without
entering into the painful fidelity of topographical littleness the
same generalizing principles pervade every variety of subject Fuseli
speaking of portrait painting as mere likenesses adds To portrait
painting thus circumstanced we subjoin as the last branch of
uninteresting subjects that kind of landscape which is entirely
occupied with the tame delineation of a given spot an enumeration of
hill and dale clumps of trees shrubs water meadows cottages and
houses what is commonly called views These if not assisted by nature
dictated by taste or chosen for character may delight the owner of the
acres they enclose the inhabitants of the spot perhaps the antiquary
or the traveller but to any other eye they are little more than
topography The landscape of Titian of Mola of Salvator of the
Poussins Claude Rubens Elsheimer Rembrandt and Wilson spurns all
relation with this kind of map-work To them nature disclosed her bosom
in the varied light of rising meridian and setting suns in twilight
night and dawn

Illustration FAC-SIMILE OF A DRAWING BY REMBRANDT IN BRITISH MUSEUM




DRAWINGS BY REMBRANDT


In looking over the numerous portfolios of drawings in public and
private libraries we are struck with the accumulated mass of mediocre
talent Many of them are often well composed and even well drawn but
they are completely destitute of what constitutes true merit they
possess no distinguishing mark whereby we can discern one master from
another they are struck off with wonderful dexterity as far as the eye
or hand is concerned but the mind is totally wanting neither do they
possess the peculiar features of natural truth whose lines are filled
with variety sometimes sharp sometimes round in parts faint and
delicate and in other places strong and cutting On the other hand
when the drawings of great painters are examined the master mind shines
forth in every touch and we recognise the works of Michael Angelo
Raffaelle Coreggio and others at a glance The drawings of Rembrandt
possess this quality in a superlative degree and the slightest
indication seems sufficient to mark the character and leading features
of the object represented His drawings are generally in pen outline
with a wash of bistre or other warm colour sometimes he makes use of
black and red chalk they are seldom finished with colours but have
often portions rendered lighter and broader by means of a wash of white
From his great practice in using the point in etching he not only
gives the greatest precision and certainty but his outline assumes the
gentlest delicacy or overpowering boldness Everything from his hand
seems to possess a largeness of form and the greatest breadth of light
and shade that can be given this it is that gives them the stamp of
truth so that it is difficult to distinguish between those drawn
immediately from nature and such as are emanations from his
imagination On looking into the catalogue of his effects we perceive
large folios of his drawings which though at the sale they produced
but small sums are now marked with their true value I may notice here
a small drawing of The Death of the Virgin that brought at the sale
of the late Baron Verstolk one hundred and sixty guineas One cannot
but regret that the excellent collection of the drawings by Rembrandt
and other masters selected by the late Sir Thomas Lawrence with great
taste and at large sums should have been lost to the country though
offered in his will at comparatively a small price Nevertheless we
possess several fine specimens in the British Museum Print-room




THE ETCHINGS OF REMBRANDT


No painter has gained so much celebrity by his etchings as Rembrandt
both on account of their number and excellence Claude Parmegiano
Berghem Paul Potter Adrian Ostade and others have all been dextrous
in using the etching point Rembrandt's performances have all the
interest and beauty of finished works his making use of the dry point
which was unknown before his application of it gives his etchings that
richness and softness peculiar to himself for the process in the
hands of others has never since been attended with the same triumphant
success The etchings consist of three hundred and sixty-five plates
accompanied by two hundred and thirty-seven variations I can only here
give their titles and dates the amateur is referred to the descriptive
catalogues of Gersaint Daulby Bartsch Claussin and Wilson The
catalogue by the latter gentleman is the one adopted by the British
Museum I have however numbered them according to the Catalogue
Raisonné of Rembrandt's Works by Smith who made use of the arrangement
of the Chevalier Claussin I have also marked those that are of the
greatest excellence with a star before the number


The life of Francis Bacon is one which it is a pain to write or to read
It is the life of a man endowed with as rare a combination of noble
gifts as ever was bestowed on a human intellect the life of one with
whom the whole purpose of living and of every day's work was to do great
things to enlighten and elevate his race to enrich it with new powers
to lay up in store for all ages to come a source of blessings which
should never fail or dry up it was the life of a man who had high
thoughts of the ends and methods of law and government and with whom
the general and public good was regarded as the standard by which the
use of public power was to be measured the life of a man who had
struggled hard and successfully for the material prosperity and opulence
which makes work easy and gives a man room and force for carrying out
his purposes All his life long his first and never-sleeping passion was
the romantic and splendid ambition after knowledge for the conquest of
nature and for the service of man gathering up in himself the spirit
and longings and efforts of all discoverers and inventors of the arts
as they are symbolised in the mythical Prometheus He rose to the
highest place and honour and yet that place and honour were but the
fringe and adornment of all that made him great It is difficult to
imagine a grander and more magnificent career and his name ranks among
the few chosen examples of human achievement And yet it was not only an
unhappy life it was a poor life We expect that such an overwhelming
weight of glory should be borne up by a character corresponding to it in
strength and nobleness But that is not what we find No one ever had a
greater idea of what he was made for or was fired with a greater desire
to devote himself to it He was all this And yet being all this seeing
deep into man's worth his capacities his greatness his weakness his
sins he was not true to what he knew He cringed to such a man as
Buckingham He sold himself to the corrupt and ignominious Government of
James I He was willing to be employed to hunt to death a friend like
Essex guilty deeply guilty to the State but to Bacon the most loving
and generous of benefactors With his eyes open he gave himself up
without resistance to a system unworthy of him he would not see what
was evil in it and chose to call its evil good and he was its first
and most signal victim

Bacon has been judged with merciless severity But he has also been
defended by an advocate whose name alone is almost a guarantee for the
justness of the cause which he takes up and the innocency of the client
for whom he argues Mr Spedding devoted nearly a lifetime and all the
resources of a fine intellect and an earnest conviction to make us
revere as well as admire Bacon But it is vain It is vain to fight
against the facts of his life his words his letters Men are made
up says a keen observer of professions gifts and talents and
also of themselves  With all his greatness his splendid genius
his magnificent ideas his enthusiasm for truth his passion to be the
benefactor of his kind with all the charm that made him loved by good
and worthy friends amiable courteous patient delightful as a
companion ready to take any trouble there was in Bacon's self a deep
and fatal flaw He was a pleaser of men There was in him that subtle
fault noted and named both by philosophy and religion in the Greek
areskos of Aristotle the Greek anthrôpareskos of St Paul which is
more common than it is pleasant to think even in good people but which
if it becomes dominant in a character is ruinous to truth and power He
was one of the men there are many of them who are unable to release
their imagination from the impression of present and immediate power
face to face with themselves It seems as if he carried into conduct the
leading rule of his philosophy of nature parendo vincitur In both
worlds moral and physical he felt himself encompassed by vast forces
irresistible by direct opposition Men whom he wanted to bring round to
his purposes were as strange as refractory as obstinate as
impenetrable as the phenomena of the natural world It was no use
attacking in front and by a direct trial of strength people like
Elizabeth or Cecil or James he might as well think of forcing some
natural power in defiance of natural law The first word of his teaching
about nature is that she must be won by observation of her tendencies
and demands the same radical disposition of temper reveals itself in
his dealings with men they too must be won by yielding to them by
adapting himself to their moods and ends by spying into the drift of
their humour by subtly and pliantly falling in with it by circuitous
and indirect processes the fruit of vigilance and patient thought He
thought to direct while submitting apparently to be directed But he
mistook his strength Nature and man are different powers and under
different laws He chose to please man and not to follow what his soul
must have told him was the better way He wanted in his dealings with
men that sincerity on which he insisted so strongly in his dealings
with nature and knowledge And the ruin of a great life was the
consequence

Francis Bacon was born in London on the   d of January        three
years before Galileo He was born at York House in the Strand the
house which though it belonged to the Archbishops of York had been
lately tenanted by Lord Keepers and Lord Chancellors in which Bacon
himself afterwards lived as Lord Chancellor and which passed after his
fall into the hands of the Duke of Buckingham who has left his mark in
the Water Gate which is now seen far from the river in the garden of
the Thames Embankment His father was Sir Nicholas Bacon Elizabeth's
first Lord Keeper the fragment of whose effigy in the Crypt of St
Paul's is one of the few relics of the old Cathedral before the fire
His uncle by marriage was that William Cecil who was to be Lord
Burghley His mother the sister of Lady Cecil was one of the daughters
of Sir Antony Cook a person deep in the confidence of the reforming
party who had been tutor of Edward VI She was a remarkable woman
highly accomplished after the fashion of the ladies of her party and as
would become her father's daughter and the austere and laborious family
to which she belonged She was exquisitely skilled in the Greek and
Latin tongues she was passionately religious according to the
uncompromising religion which the exiles had brought back with them from
Geneva Strasburg and Zurich and which saw in Calvin's theology a
solution of all the difficulties and in his discipline a remedy for all
the evils of mankind This means that his boyhood from the first was
passed among the high places of the world at one of the greatest crises
of English history in the very centre and focus of its agitations He
was brought up among the chiefs and leaders of the rising religion in
the houses of the greatest and most powerful persons of the State and
naturally as their child at times in the Court of the Queen who joked
with him and called him her young Lord Keeper It means also that the
religious atmosphere in which he was brought up was that of the nascent
and aggressive Puritanism which was not satisfied with the compromises
of the Elizabethan Reformation and which saw in the moral poverty and
incapacity of many of its chiefs a proof against the great traditional
system of the Church which Elizabeth was loath to part with and which
in spite of all its present and inevitable shortcomings her political
sagacity taught her to reverence and trust

At the age of twelve he was sent to Cambridge and put under Whitgift at
Trinity It is a question which recurs continually to readers about
those times and their precocious boys what boys were then For whatever
was the learning of the universities these boys took their place with
men and consorted with them sharing such knowledge as men had and
performing exercises and hearing lectures according to the standard of
men Grotius at eleven was the pupil and companion of Scaliger and the
learned band of Leyden at fourteen he was part of the company which
went with the ambassadors of the States-General to Henry IV at sixteen
he was called to the bar he published an out-of-the-way Latin writer
Martianus Capella with a learned commentary and he was the
correspondent of De Thou When Bacon was hardly sixteen he was admitted
to the Society of Ancients of Gray's Inn and he went in the household
of Sir Amyas Paulet the Queen's Ambassador to France He thus spent
two years in France not in Paris alone but at Blois Tours and
Poitiers If this was precocious there is no indication that it was
thought precocious It only meant that clever and promising boys were
earlier associated with men in important business than is customary now
The old and the young heads began to work together sooner Perhaps they
felt that there was less time to spare In spite of instances of
longevity life was shorter for the average of busy men for the
conditions of life were worse

Two recollections only have been preserved of his early years One is
that as he told his chaplain Dr Rawley late in life he had
discovered as far back as his Cambridge days the unfruitfulness of
Aristotle's method It is easy to make too much of this It is not
uncommon for undergraduates to criticise their text-books it was the
fashion with clever men as for instance Montaigne to talk against
Aristotle without knowing anything about him it is not uncommon for men
who have worked out a great idea to find traces of it on precarious
grounds in their boyish thinking Still it is worth noting that Bacon
himself believed that his fundamental quarrel with Aristotle had begun
with the first efforts of thought and that this is the one recollection
remaining of his early tendency in speculation The other is more
trustworthy and exhibits that inventiveness which was characteristic
of his mind He tells us in the De Augmentis that when he was in
France he occupied himself with devising an improved system of
cypher-writing a thing of daily and indispensable use for rival
statesmen and rival intriguers But the investigation with its call on
the calculating and combining faculties would also interest him as an
example of the discovery of new powers by the human mind

In the beginning of      Bacon at eighteen was called home by his
father's death This was a great blow to his prospects His father had
not accomplished what he had intended for him and Francis Bacon was
left with only a younger son's narrow portion What was worse he lost
one whose credit would have served him in high places He entered on
life not as he might have expected independent and with court favour
on his side but with his very livelihood to gain a competitor at the
bottom of the ladder for patronage and countenance This great change in
his fortunes told very unfavourably on his happiness his usefulness
and it must be added on his character He accepted it indeed
manfully and at once threw himself into the study of the law as the
profession by which he was to live But the law though it was the only
path open to him was not the one which suited his genius or his object
in life To the last he worked hard and faithfully but with doubtful
reputation as to his success and certainly against the grain And this
was not the worst To make up for the loss of that start in life of
which his father's untimely death had deprived him he became for
almost the rest of his life the most importunate and most untiring of
suitors

In      or      Bacon took up his abode at Gray's Inn which for a long
time was his home He went through the various steps of his profession
He began what he never discontinued his earnest and humble appeals to
his relative the great Lord Burghley to employ him in the Queen's
service or to put him in some place of independence through Lord
Burghley's favour he seems to have been pushed on at his Inn where in
     he was a Bencher and in      he came into Parliament for Melcombe
Regis He took some small part in Parliament but the only record of his
speeches is contained in a surly note of Recorder Fleetwood who writes
as an old member might do of a young one talking nonsense He sat again
for Liverpool in the year of the Armada      and his name begins to
appear in the proceedings These early years we know were busy ones
In them Bacon laid the foundation of his observations and judgments on
men and affairs and in them the great purpose and work of his life was
conceived and shaped But they are more obscure years than might have
been expected in the case of a man of Bacon's genius and family and of
such eager and unconcealed desire to rise and be at work No doubt he
was often pinched in his means his health was weak and he was delicate
and fastidious in his care of it Plunged in work he lived very much as
a recluse in his chambers and was thought to be reserved and what
those who disliked him called arrogant But Bacon was
ambitious ambitious in the first place of the Queen's notice and
favour He was versatile brilliant courtly besides being his father's
son and considering how rapidly bold and brilliant men were able to
push their way and take the Queen's favour by storm it seems strange
that Bacon should have remained fixedly in the shade Something must
have kept him back Burghley was not the man to neglect a useful
instrument with such good will to serve him But all that Mr
Spedding's industry and profound interest in the subject has brought
together throws but an uncertain light on Bacon's long disappointment
Was it the rooted misgiving of a man of affairs like Burghley at that
passionate contempt of all existing knowledge and that undoubting
confidence in his own power to make men know as they never had known
which Bacon was even now professing Or was it something soft and
over-obsequious in character which made the uncle who knew well what
men he wanted disinclined to encourage and employ the nephew Was
Francis not hard enough not narrow enough too full of ideas too much
alive to the shakiness of current doctrines and arguments on religion
and policy Was he too open to new impressions made by objections or
rival views Or did he show signs of wanting backbone to stand amid
difficulties and threatening prospects Did Burghley see something in
him of the pliability which he could remember as the serviceable quality
of his own young days which suited those days of rapid change but not
days when change was supposed to be over and when the qualities which
were wanted were those which resist and defy it The only thing that is
clear is that Burghley in spite of Bacon's continual applications
abstained to the last from advancing his fortunes

Whether employed by government or not Bacon began at this time to
prepare those carefully-written papers on the public affairs of the day
of which he has left a good many In our day they would have been
pamphlets or magazine articles In his they were circulated in
manuscript and only occasionally printed The first of any importance
is a letter of advice to the Queen about the year      on the policy
to be followed with a view to keeping in check the Roman Catholic
interest at home and abroad It is calm sagacious and according to
the fashion of the age slightly Machiavellian But the first subject on
which Bacon exhibited his characteristic qualities his appreciation of
facts his balance of thought and his power when not personally
committed of standing aloof from the ordinary prejudices and
assumptions of men round him was the religious condition and prospects
of the English Church Bacon had been brought up in a Puritan household
of the straitest sect His mother was an earnest severe and intolerant
Calvinist deep in the interests and cause of her party bitterly
resenting all attempts to keep in order its pretensions She was a
masterful woman claiming to meddle with her brother-in-law's policy
and though a most affectionate mother she was a woman of violent and
ungovernable temper Her letters to her son Antony whom she loved
passionately but whom she suspected of keeping dangerous and papistical
company show us the imperious spirit in which she claimed to interfere
with her sons and they show also that in Francis she did not find all
the deference which she looked for Recommending Antony to frequent the
religious exercises of the sincerer sort she warns him not to follow
his brother's advice or example Antony was advised to use prayer twice
a day with his servants Your brother she adds is too negligent
therein She is anxious about Antony's health and warns him not to
fall into his brother's ill-ordered habits I verily think your
brother's weak stomach to digest hath been much caused and confirmed by
untimely going to bed and then musing nescio quid when he should
sleep and then in consequent by late rising and long lying in bed
whereby his men are made slothful and himself continueth sickly But my
sons haste not to hearken to their mother's good counsel in time to
prevent It seems clear that Francis Bacon had shown his mother that
not only in the care of his health but in his judgment on religious
matters he meant to go his own way Mr Spedding thinks that she must
have had much influence on him it seems more likely that he resented
her interference and that the hard and narrow arrogance which she read
into the Gospel produced in him a strong reaction Bacon was obsequious
to the tyranny of power but he was never inclined to bow to the tyranny
of opinion and the tyranny of Puritan infallibility was the last thing
to which he was likely to submit His mother would have wished him to
sit under Cartwright and Travers The friend of his choice was the
Anglican preacher Dr Andrewes to whom he submitted all his works and
whom he called his inquisitor general and he was proud to sign
himself the pupil of Whitgift and to write for him the archbishop of
whom Lady Bacon wrote to her son Antony veiling the dangerous sentiment
in Greek that he was the ruin of the Church for he loved his own
glory more than Christ's

Certainly in the remarkable paper on Controversies in the Church
     Bacon had ceased to feel or to speak as a Puritan The paper is
an attempt to compose the controversy by pointing out the mistakes in
judgment in temper and in method on both sides It is entirely unlike
what a Puritan would have written it is too moderate too tolerant too
neutral though like most essays of conciliation it is open to the
rejoinder from both sides certainly from the Puritan that it begs the
question by assuming the unimportance of the matters about which each
contended with so much zeal It is the confirmation but also the
complement and in some ways the correction of Hooker's contemporary
view of the quarrel which was threatening the life of the English
Church and not even Hooker could be so comprehensive and so fair For
Hooker had to defend much that was indefensible he had to defend a
great traditional system just convulsed by a most tremendous shock a
shock and alteration as Bacon says the greatest and most dangerous
that can be in a State in which old clews and habits and rules were
confused and all but lost in which a frightful amount of personal
incapacity and worthlessness had from sheer want of men risen to the
high places of the Church and in which force and violence sometimes of
the most hateful kind had come to be accepted as ordinary instruments
in the government of souls Hooker felt too strongly the unfairness the
folly the intolerant aggressiveness the malignity of his opponents he
was too much alive to the wrongs inflicted by them on his own side and
to the incredible absurdity of their arguments to do justice to what
was only too real in the charges and complaints of those opponents But
Bacon came from the very heart of the Puritan camp He had seen the
inside of Puritanism its best as well as its worst side He witnesses
to the humility the conscientiousness the labour the learning the
hatred of sin and wrong of many of its preachers He had heard and
heard with sympathy all that could be urged against the bishops'
administration and against a system of legal oppression in the name of
the Church Where religious elements were so confusedly mixed and where
each side had apparently so much to urge on behalf of its claims he saw
the deep mistake of loftily ignoring facts and of want of patience and
forbearance with those who were scandalised at abuses while the abuses
in some cases monstrous were tolerated and turned to profit Towards
the bishops and their policy though his language is very respectful
for the government was implicated he is very severe They punish and
restrain but they do not themselves mend their ways or supply what was
wanting and theirs are injuriæ potentiorum injuries come from
them that have the upperhand But Hooker himself did not put his finger
more truly and more surely on the real mischief of the Puritan movement
on the immense outbreak in it of unreasonable party spirit and visible
personal ambition these are the true successors of Diotrephes and not
my lord bishops on the gradual development of the Puritan theory till
it came at last to claim a supremacy as unquestionable and intolerant as
that of the Papacy on the servile affectation of the fashions of Geneva
and Strasburg on the poverty and foolishness of much of the Puritan
teaching its inability to satisfy the great questions which it raised
in the soul its unworthy dealing with Scripture naked examples
conceited inferences and forced allusions which mine into all
certainty of religion the word the bread of life they toss up and
down they break it not on their undervaluing of moral worth if it
did not speak in their phraseology as they censure virtuous men by the
names of civil and moral so do they censure men truly and godly
wise who see into the vanity of their assertions by the name of
politiques saying that their wisdom is but carnal and savouring of
man's brain Bacon saw that the Puritans were aiming at a tyranny
which if they established it would be more comprehensive more
searching and more cruel than that of the older systems but he thought
it a remote and improbable danger and that they might safely be
tolerated for the work they did in education and preaching because the
work of exhortation doth chiefly rest upon these men and they have a
zeal and hate of sin But he ends by warning them lest that be true
which one of their adversaries said that they have but two small
wants knowledge and love One complaint that he makes of them is a
curious instance of the changes of feeling or at least of language on
moral subjects He accuses them of having pronounced generally and
without difference all untruths unlawful forgetful of the Egyptian
midwives and Rahab and Solomon and even of Him who the more to
touch the hearts of the disciples with a holy dalliance made as though
he would have passed Emmaus He is thinking of their failure to apply a
principle which was characteristic of his mode of thought that even a
statement about a virtue like veracity hath limit as all things else
have but it is odd to find Bacon bringing against the Puritans the
converse of the charge which his age and Pascal afterwards brought
against the Jesuits The essay besides being a picture of the times as
regards religion is an example of what was to be Bacon's characteristic
strength and weakness his strength in lifting up a subject which had
been degraded by mean and wrangling disputations into a higher and
larger light and bringing to bear on it great principles and the
results of the best human wisdom and experience expressed in weighty
and pregnant maxims his weakness in forgetting as in spite of his
philosophy he so often did that the grandest major premises need
well-proved and ascertained minors and that the enunciation of a
principle is not the same thing as the application of it Doubtless
there is truth in his closing words but each party would have made the
comment that what he had to prove and had not proved was that by
following his counsel they would love the whole world better than a
part

     Let them not fear  the fond calumny of neutrality but let
     them know that is true which is said by a wise man that neuters
     in contentions are either better or worse than either side These
     things have I in all sincerity and simplicity set down touching the
     controversies which now trouble the Church of England and that
     without all art and insinuation and therefore not like to be
     grateful to either part Notwithstanding I trust what has been
     said shall find a correspondence in their minds which are not
     embarked in partiality and which love the whole letter than a
     part

Up to this time though Bacon had showed himself capable of taking a
broad and calm view of questions which it was the fashion among good
men and men who were in possession of the popular ear to treat with
narrowness and heat there was nothing to disclose his deeper
thoughts nothing foreshadowed the purpose which was to fill his life
He had indeed at the age of twenty-five written a youthful
philosophical essay to which he gave the pompous title Temporis
Partus Maximus the Greatest Birth of Time But he was thirty-one
when we first find an indication of the great idea and the great
projects which were to make his name famous This indication is
contained in an earnest appeal to Lord Burghley for some help which
should not be illusory Its words are distinct and far-reaching and
they are the first words from him which tell us what was in his heart
The letter has the interest to us of the first announcement of a promise
which to ordinary minds must have appeared visionary and extravagant
but which was so splendidly fulfilled the first distant sight of that
sea of knowledge which henceforth was opened to mankind but on which no
man as he thought had yet entered It contains the famous avowal I
have taken all knowledge to be my province made in the confidence
born of long and silent meditations and questionings but made in a
simple good faith which is as far as possible from vain boastfulness

     MY LORD With as much confidence as mine own honest and faithful
     devotion unto your service and your honourable correspondence unto
     me and my poor estate can breed in a man do I commend myself unto
     your Lordship I wax now somewhat ancient one and thirty years is
     a great deal of sand in the hour glass My health I thank God I
     find confirmed and I do not fear that action shall impair it
     because I account my ordinary course of study and meditation to be
     more painful than most parts of action are I ever bare a mind in
     some middle place that I could discharge to serve her Majesty not
     as a man born under Sol that loveth honour nor under Jupiter
     that loveth business for the contemplative planet carrieth me away
     wholly but as a man born under an excellent sovereign that
     deserveth the dedication of all men's abilities Besides I do not
     find in myself so much self-love but that the greater parts of my
     thoughts are to deserve well if I be able of my friends and
     namely of your Lordship who being the Atlas of this commonwealth
     the honour of my house and the second founder of my poor estate I
     am tied by all duties both of a good patriot and of an unworthy
     kinsman and of an obliged servant to employ whatsoever I am to do
     you service Again the meanness of my estate doth somewhat move
     me for though I cannot accuse myself that I am either prodigal or
     slothful yet my health is not to spend nor my course to get
     Lastly I confess that I have as vast contemplative ends as I have
     moderate civil ends for I have taken all knowledge to be my
     province and if I could purge it of two sorts of rovers whereof
     the one with frivolous disputations confutations and verbosities
     the other with blind experiments and auricular traditions and
     impostures hath committed so many spoils I hope I should bring in
     industrious observations grounded conclusions and profitable
     inventions and discoveries the best state of that province This
     whether it be curiosity or vain glory or nature or if one take
     it favourably philanthropia is so fixed in my mind as it cannot
     be removed And I do easily see that place of any reasonable
     countenance doth bring commandment of more wits than of a man's
     own which is the thing I greatly affect And for your Lordship
     perhaps you shall not find more strength and less encounter in any
     other And if your Lordship shall find now or at any time that I
     do seek or affect any place whereunto any that is nearer unto your
     Lordship shall be concurrent say then that I am a most dishonest
     man And if your Lordship will not carry me on I will not do as
     Anaxagoras did who reduced himself with contemplation unto
     voluntary poverty but this I will do I will sell the inheritance
     I have and purchase some lease of quick revenue or some office of
     gain that shall be executed by deputy and so give over all care of
     service and become some sorry book-maker or a true pioneer in
     that mine of truth which he said lay so deep This which I have
     writ unto your Lordship is rather thoughts than words being set
     down without all art disguising or reservation Wherein I have
     done honour both to your Lordship's wisdom in judging that that
     will be best believed of your Lordship which is truest and to your
     Lordship's good nature in retaining nothing from you And even so
     I wish your Lordship all happiness and to myself means and
     occasions to be added to my faithful desire to do you service From
     my lodgings at Gray's Inn

This letter to his unsympathetic and suspicious but probably not
unfriendly relative is the key to Bacon's plan of life which with
numberless changes of form he followed to the end That is a
profession steadily seriously and laboriously kept to in order to
provide the means of living and beyond that as the ultimate and real
end of his life the pursuit in a way unattempted before of all
possible human knowledge and of the methods to improve it and make it
sure and fruitful And so his life was carried out On the one hand it
was a continual and pertinacious seeking after government employment
which could give credit to his name and put money in his
pocket attempts by general behaviour by professional services when the
occasion offered by putting his original and fertile pen at the service
of the government to win confidence and to overcome the manifest
indisposition of those in power to think that a man who cherished the
chimera of universal knowledge could be a useful public servant On the
other hand all the while in the crises of his disappointment or
triumph the one great subject lay next his heart filling him with
fire and passion how really to know and to teach men to know indeed
and to use their knowledge so as to command nature the great hope to be
the reformer and restorer of knowledge in a more wonderful sense than
the world had yet seen in the reformation of learning and religion and
in the spread of civilised order in the great states of the Renaissance
time To this he gave his best and deepest thoughts for this he was for
ever accumulating and for ever rearranging and reshaping those masses
of observation and inquiry and invention and mental criticism which were
to come in as parts of the great design which he had seen in the visions
of his imagination and of which at last he was only able to leave noble
fragments incomplete after numberless recastings This was not indeed
the only but it was the predominant and governing interest of his
life Whether as solicitor for Court favour or public office whether
drudging at the work of the law or managing State prosecutions whether
writing an opportune pamphlet against Spain or Father Parsons or
inventing a device for his Inn or for Lord Essex to give amusement to
Queen Elizabeth whether fulfilling his duties as member of Parliament
or rising step by step to the highest places in the Council Board and
the State whether in the pride of success or under the amazement of
unexpected and irreparable overthrow while it seemed as if he was only
measuring his strength against the rival ambitions of the day in the
same spirit and with the same object as his competitors the true motive
of all his eagerness and all his labours was not theirs He wanted to be
powerful and still more to be rich but he wanted to be so because
without power and without money he could not follow what was to him the
only thing worth following on earth a real knowledge of the amazing and
hitherto almost unknown world in which he had to live Bacon to us at
least at this distance who can only judge him from partial and
imperfect knowledge often seems to fall far short of what a man should
be He was not one of the high-minded and proud searchers after
knowledge and truth like Descartes who were content to accept a frugal
independence so that their time and their thoughts might be their own
Bacon was a man of the world and wished to live in and with the world
He threatened sometimes retirement but never with any very serious
intention In the Court was his element and there were his hopes Often
there seems little to distinguish him from the ordinary place-hunters
obsequious and selfish of every age little to distinguish him from the
servile and insincere flatterers of whom he himself complains who
crowded the antechambers of the great Queen content to submit with
smiling face and thankful words to the insolence of her waywardness and
temper in the hope more often disappointed than not of hitting her
taste on some lucky occasion and being rewarded for the accident by a
place of gain or honour Bacon's history as read in his letters is not
an agreeable one after every allowance made for the fashions of
language and the necessities of a suitor there is too much of insincere
profession of disinterestedness too much of exaggerated profession of
admiration and devoted service too much of disparagement and
insinuation against others for a man who respected himself He
submitted too much to the miserable conditions of rising which he found
But nevertheless it must be said that it was for no mean object for
no mere private selfishness or vanity that he endured all this He
strove hard to be a great man and a rich man But it was that he might
have his hands free and strong and well furnished to carry forward the
double task of overthrowing ignorance and building up the new and solid
knowledge on which his heart was set that immense conquest of nature on
behalf of man which he believed to be possible and of which he believed
himself to have the key

The letter to Lord Burghley did not help him much He received the
reversion of a place the Clerkship of the Council which did not become
vacant for twenty years But these years of service declined and place
withheld were busy and useful ones What he was most intent upon and
what occupied his deepest and most serious thought was unknown to the
world round him and probably not very intelligible to his few intimate
friends such as his brother Antony and Dr Andrewes Meanwhile he
placed his pen at the disposal of the authorities and though they
regarded him more as a man of study than of practice and experience
they were glad to make use of it His versatile genius found another
employment Besides his affluence in topics he had the liveliest fancy
and most active imagination But that he wanted the sense of poetic
fitness and melody he might almost be supposed with his reach and play
of thought to have been capable as is maintained in some eccentric
modern theories of writing Shakespeare's plays No man ever had a more
imaginative power of illustration drawn from the most remote and most
unlikely analogies analogies often of the quaintest and most unexpected
kind but often also not only felicitous in application but profound and
true His powers were early called upon for some of those sportive
compositions in which that age delighted on occasions of rejoicing or
festival Three of his contributions to these devices have been
preserved two of them composed in honour of the Queen as triumphs
offered by Lord Essex one probably in      and another in      a
third for a Gray's Inn revel in      The devices themselves were of
the common type of the time extravagant odd full of awkward allegory
and absurd flattery and running to a prolixity which must make modern
lovers of amusement wonder at the patience of those days but the
discourses furnished by Bacon are full of fine observation and
brilliant thought and wit and happy illustration which fantastic as
the general conception is raises them far above the level of such
fugitive trifles

Among the fragmentary papers belonging to this time which have come
down not the least curious are those which throw light on his manner of
working While he was following out the great ideas which were to be the
basis of his philosophy he was as busy and as painstaking in fashioning
the instruments by which they were to be expressed and in these papers
we have the records and specimens of this preparation He was a great
collector of sentences proverbs quotations sayings illustrations
anecdotes and he seems to have read sometimes simply to gather phrases
and apt words He jots down at random any good and pointed remark which
comes into his thought or his memory at another time he groups a set of
stock quotations with a special drift bearing on some subject such as
the faults of universities or the habits of lawyers Nothing is too
minute for his notice He brings together in great profusion mere forms
varied turns of expression heads and tails of clauses and paragraphs
transitions connections he notes down fashions of compliment of
excuse or repartee even morning and evening salutations he records
neat and convenient opening and concluding sentences ways of speaking
more adapted than others to give a special colour or direction to what
the speaker or writer has to say all that hook-and-eye work which seems
so trivial and passes so unnoticed as a matter of course and which yet
is often hard to reach and which makes all the difference between
tameness and liveliness between clearness and obscurity all the
difference not merely to the ease and naturalness but often to the
logical force of speech These collections it was his way to sift and
transcribe again and again adding as well as omitting From one of
these belonging to      and the following years the Promus of
Formularies and Elegancies Mr Spedding has given curious extracts
and the whole collection has been recently edited by Mrs Henry Pott
Thus it was that he prepared himself for what as we read it or as his
audience heard it seems the suggestion or recollection of the moment
Bacon was always much more careful of the value or aptness of a thought
than of its appearing new and original Of all great writers he least
minds repeating himself perhaps in the very same words so that a
simile an illustration a quotation pleases him he returns to it he
is never tired of it it obviously gives him satisfaction to introduce
it again and again These collections of odds and ends illustrate
another point in his literary habits His was a mind keenly sensitive to
all analogies and affinities impatient of a strict and rigid logical
groove but spreading as it were tentacles on all sides in quest of
chance prey and quickened into a whole system of imagination by the
electric quiver imparted by a single word at once the key and symbol of
the thinking it had led to And so he puts down word or phrase so
enigmatical to us who see it by itself which to him would wake up a
whole train of ideas as he remembered the occasion of it how at a
certain time and place this word set the whole moving seemed to
breathe new life and shed new light and has remained the token
meaningless in itself which reminds him of so much

When we come to read his letters his speeches his works we come
continually on the results and proofs of this early labour Some of the
most memorable and familiar passages of his writings are to be traced
from the storehouses which he filled in these years of preparation An
example of this correspondence between the note-book and the composition
is to be seen in a paper belonging to this period written apparently to
form part of a masque or as he himself calls it a Conference of
Pleasure and entitled the Praise of Knowledge It is interesting
because it is the first draught which we have from him of some of the
leading ideas and most characteristic language about the defects and the
improvement of knowledge which were afterwards embodied in the
Advancement and the Novum Organum The whole spirit and aim of his
great reform is summed up in the following fine passage

     Facility to believe impatience to doubt temerity to assever
     glory to know doubt to contradict end to gain sloth to search
     seeking things in words resting in a part of nature these and the
     like have been the things which have forbidden the happy match
     between the mind of man and the nature of things and in place
     thereof have married it to vain notions and blind experiments
     Therefore no doubt the sovereignty of man lieth hid in
     knowledge wherein many things are reserved which kings with their
     treasures cannot buy nor with their force command their spials and
     intelligencers can give no news of them their seamen and
     discoverers cannot sail where they grow Now we govern nature in
     opinions but we are thrall unto her in necessity but if we could
     be led by her in invention we should command her in action

To the same occasion as the discourse on the Praise of Knowledge
belongs also one in Praise of the Queen As one is an early specimen
of his manner of writing on philosophy so this is a specimen of what
was equally characteristic of him his political and historical writing
It is in form necessarily a panegyric as high-flown and adulatory as
such performances in those days were bound to be But it is not only
flattery It fixes with true discrimination on the points in Elizabeth's
character and reign which were really subjects of admiration and homage
Thus of her unquailing spirit at the time of the Spanish invasion 

     Lastly see a Queen that when her realm was to have been invaded
     by an army the preparation whereof was like the travail of an
     elephant the provisions infinite the setting forth whereof was
     the terror and wonder of Europe it was not seen that her cheer
     her fashion her ordinary manner was anything altered not a cloud
     of that storm did appear in that countenance wherein peace doth
     ever shine but with excellent assurance and advised security she
     inspired her council animated her nobility redoubled the courage
     of her people still having this noble apprehension not only that
     she would communicate her fortune with them but that it was she
     that would protect them and not they her which she testified by
     no less demonstration than her presence in camp Therefore that
     magnanimity that neither feareth greatness of alteration nor the
     vows of conspirators nor the power of the enemy is more than
     heroical

These papers though he put his best workmanship into them as he
invariably did with whatever he touched were of an ornamental kind But
he did more serious work In the year      a pamphlet had been published
on the Continent in Latin and English Responsio ad Edictum Reginæ
Angliæ with reference to the severe legislation which followed on the
Armada making such charges against the Queen and the Government as it
was natural for the Roman Catholic party to make and making them with
the utmost virulence and unscrupulousness It was supposed to be written
by the ablest of the Roman pamphleteers Father Parsons The Government
felt it to be a dangerous indictment and Bacon was chosen to write the
answer to it He had additional interest in the matter for the pamphlet
made a special and bitter attack on Burghley as the person mainly
responsible for the Queen's policy Bacon's reply is long and elaborate
taking up every charge and reviewing from his own point of view the
whole course of the struggle between the Queen and the supporters of the
Roman Catholic interest abroad and at home It cannot be considered an
impartial review besides that it was written to order no man in
England could then write impartially in that quarrel but it is not more
one-sided and uncandid than the pamphlet which it answers and Bacon is
able to recriminate with effect and to show gross credulity and
looseness of assertion on the part of the Roman Catholic advocate But
religion had too much to do with the politics of both sides for either
to be able to come into the dispute with clean hands the Roman
Catholics meant much more than toleration and the sanguinary
punishments of the English law against priests and Jesuits were edged by
something even keener than the fear of treason But the paper contains
some large surveys of public affairs which probably no one at that time
could write but Bacon Bacon never liked to waste anything good which he
had written and much of what he had written in the panegyric in Praise
of the Queen is made use of again and transferred with little change
to the pages of the Observations on a Libel

CHAPTER II

BACON AND ELIZABETH


The last decade of the century and almost of Elizabeth's reign
    -     was an eventful one to Bacon's fortunes In it the vision
of his great design disclosed itself more and more to his imagination
and hopes and with more and more irresistible fascination In it he
made his first literary venture the first edition of his Essays
     ten in number the first-fruits of his early and ever watchful
observation of men and affairs These years too saw his first steps in
public life the first efforts to bring him into importance the first
great trials and tests of his character They saw the beginning and they
saw the end of his relations with the only friend who at that time
recognised his genius and his purposes certainly the only friend who
ever pushed his claims they saw the growth of a friendship which was to
have so tragical a close and they saw the beginnings and causes of a
bitter personal rivalry which was to last through life and which was to
be a potent element hereafter in Bacon's ruin The friend was the Earl
of Essex The competitor was the ablest and also the most truculent and
unscrupulous of English lawyers Edward Coke

While Bacon in the shade had been laying the foundations of his
philosophy of nature and vainly suing for legal or political
employment another man had been steadily rising in the Queen's favour
and carrying all before him at Court Robert Devereux Lord Essex and
with Essex Bacon had formed an acquaintance which had ripened into an
intimate and affectionate friendship We commonly think of Essex as a
vain and insolent favourite who did ill the greatest work given him to
do the reduction of Ireland who did it ill from some unexplained
reason of spite and mischief and who when called to account for it
broke out into senseless and idle rebellion This was the end But he
was not always thus He began life with great gifts and noble ends he
was a serious modest and large-minded student both of books and
things and he turned his studies to full account He had imagination
and love of enterprise which gave him an insight into Bacon's ideas
such as none of Bacon's contemporaries had He was a man of simple and
earnest religion he sympathized most with the Puritans because they
were serious and because they were hardly used Those who most condemn
him acknowledge his nobleness and generosity of nature Bacon in after
days when all was over between them spoke of him as a man always
patientissimus veri the more plainly and frankly you shall deal with
my lord he writes elsewhere not only in disclosing particulars but
in giving him caveats and admonishing him of any error which in this
action he may commit such is his lordship's nature the better he will
take it He must have seemed says Mr Spedding a little too
grandly in the eyes of Bacon like the hope of the world The two men
certainly became warmly attached Their friendship came to be one of
the closest kind full of mutual services and of genuine affection on
both sides It was not the relation of a great patron and useful
dependant it was what might be expected in the two men that of
affectionate equality Each man was equally capable of seeing what the
other was and saw it What Essex's feelings were towards Bacon the
results showed Bacon in after years repeatedly claimed to have
devoted his whole time and labour to Essex's service Holding him he
says to be the fittest instrument to do good to the State I applied
myself to him in a manner which I think rarely happeneth among men
neglecting the Queen's service mine own fortune and in a sort my
vocation I did nothing but advise and ruminate with myself  anything
that might concern his lordship's honour fortune or service The
claim is far too wide The Queen's service had hardly as yet come much
in Bacon's way and he never neglected it when it did come nor his own
fortune or vocation his letters remain to attest his care in these
respects But no doubt Bacon was then as ready to be of use to Essex
the one man who seemed to understand and value him as Essex was
desirous to be of use to Bacon

And it seemed as if Essex would have the ability as well as the wish
Essex was without exception the most brilliant man who ever appeared
at Elizabeth's Court and it seemed as if he were going to be the most
powerful Leicester was dead Burghley was growing old and indisposed
for the adventures and levity which with all her grand power of ruling
Elizabeth loved She needed a favourite and Essex was unfortunately
marked out for what she wanted He had Leicester's fascination without
his mean and cruel selfishness He was as generous as gallant as quick
to descry all great things in art and life as Philip Sidney with more
vigour and fitness for active life than Sidney He had not Raleigh's
sad dark depths of thought but he had a daring courage equal to
Raleigh's without Raleigh's cynical contempt for mercy and honour He
had every personal advantage requisite for a time when intellect and
ready wit and high-tempered valour and personal beauty and skill in
affairs with equal skill in amusements were expected to go together in
the accomplished courtier And Essex was a man not merely to be courted
and admired to shine and dazzle but to be loved Elizabeth with her
strange and perverse emotional constitution loved him if she ever
loved any one Every one who served him loved him and he was as much
as any one could be in those days a popular favourite Under better
fortune he might have risen to a great height of character in
Elizabeth's Court he was fated to be ruined

For in that Court all the qualities in him which needed control received
daily stimulus and his ardour and high-aiming temper turned into
impatience and restless irritability He had a mistress who was at one
time in the humour to be treated as a tender woman at another as an
outrageous flirt at another as the haughtiest and most imperious of
queens her mood varied no one could tell how and it was most
dangerous to mistake it It was part of her pleasure to find in her
favourite a spirit as high a humour as contradictory and determined as
her own it was the charming contrast to the obsequiousness or the
prudence of the rest but no one could be sure at what unlooked-for
moment and how fiercely she might resent in earnest a display of what
she had herself encouraged Essex was ruined for all real greatness by
having to suit himself to this bewildering and most unwholesome and
degrading waywardness She taught him to think himself irresistible in
opinion and in claims she amused herself in teaching him how completely
he was mistaken Alternately spoiled and crossed he learned to be
exacting unreasonable absurd in his pettish resentments or brooding
sullenness He learned to think that she must be dealt with by the same
methods which she herself employed The effect was not produced in a
moment it was the result of a courtiership of sixteen years But it
ended in corrupting a noble nature Essex came to believe that she who
cowed others must be frightened herself that the stinging injustice
which led a proud man to expect only to see how he would behave when
refused deserved to be brought to reason by a counter-buffet as rough
as her own insolent caprice He drifted into discontent into
disaffection into neglect of duty into questionable schemings for the
future of a reign that must shortly end into criminal methods of
guarding himself of humbling his rivals and regaining influence A
fatal impatience as Bacon calls it gave his rivals an advantage
which perhaps in self-defence they could not fail to take and that
career so brilliant so full of promise of good ended in misery in
dishonour in remorse on the scaffold of the Tower

With this attractive and powerful person Bacon's fortunes in the last
years of the century became more and more knit up Bacon was now past
thirty Essex a few years younger In spite of Bacon's apparent
advantage and interest at Court in spite of abilities which though
his genius was not yet known his contemporaries clearly recognised he
was still a struggling and unsuccessful man ambitious to rise for no
unworthy reasons but needy in weak health with careless and expensive
habits and embarrassed with debt He had hoped to rise by the favour of
the Queen and for the sake of his father For some ill-explained reason
he was to the last disappointed Though she used him for matters of
state and revenue she either did not like him or did not see in him
the servant she wanted to advance He went on to the last pressing his
uncle Lord Burghley He applied in the humblest terms he made himself
useful with his pen he got his mother to write for him but Lord
Burghley probably because he thought his nephew more of a man of
letters than a sound lawyer and practical public servant did not care
to bring him forward From his cousin Robert Cecil Bacon received
polite words and friendly assurances Cecil may have undervalued him or
have been jealous of him or suspected him as a friend of Essex he
certainly gave Bacon good reason to think that his words meant nothing
Except Essex and perhaps his brother Antony the most affectionate and
devoted of brothers no one had yet recognised all that Bacon was
Meanwhile time was passing The vastness the difficulties the
attractions of that conquest of all knowledge which he dreamed of were
becoming greater every day to his thoughts The law without which he
could not live took up time and brought in little Attendance on the
Court was expensive yet indispensable if he wished for place His
mother was never very friendly and thought him absurd and extravagant
Debts increased and creditors grumbled The outlook was discouraging
when his friendship with Essex opened to him a more hopeful prospect

In the year      the Attorney-General's place was vacant and Essex who
in that year became a Privy Councillor determined that Bacon should be
Attorney-General Bacon's reputation as a lawyer was overshadowed by his
philosophical and literary pursuits He was thought young for the
office and he had not yet served in any subordinate place And there
was another man who was supposed to carry all English law in his head
full of rude force and endless precedents hard of heart and voluble of
tongue who also wanted it An Attorney-General was one who would bring
all the resources and hidden subtleties of English law to the service of
the Crown and use them with thorough-going and unflinching resolution
against those whom the Crown accused of treason sedition or invasion
of the prerogative It is no wonder that the Cecils and the Queen
herself thought Coke likely to be a more useful public servant than
Bacon it is certain what Coke himself thought about it and what his
estimate was of the man whom Essex was pushing against him But Essex
did not take up his friend's cause in the lukewarm fashion in which
Burghley had patronised his nephew There was nothing that Essex pursued
with greater pertinacity He importuned the Queen He risked without
scruple offending her She apparently long shrank from directly refusing
his request The Cecils were for Coke the Huddler as Bacon calls
him in a letter to Essex but the appointment was delayed All through
     and until April      the struggle went on

When Robert Cecil suggested that Essex should be content with the
Solicitor's place for Bacon praying him to be well advised for if his
Lordship had spoken of that it might have been of easier digestion to
the Queen he turned round on Cecil 

     Digest me no digesting said the Earl for the Attorneyship is
     that I must have for Francis Bacon and in that I will spend my
     uttermost credit friendship and authority against whomsoever and
     that whosoever went about to procure it to others that it should
     cost both the mediators and the suitors the setting on before they
     came by it And this be you assured of Sir Robert quoth the
     Earl for now do I fully declare myself and for your own part
     Sir Robert I do think much and strange both of my Lord your father
     and you that can have the mind to seek the preferment of a
     stranger before so near a kinsman namely considering if you weigh
     in a balance his parts and sufficiency in any respect with those
     of his competitor excepting only four poor years of admittance
     which Francis Bacon hath more than recompensed with the priority of
     his reading in all other respects you shall find no comparison
     between them

But the Queen's disgust at some very slight show of independence on
Bacon's part in Parliament unforgiven in spite of repeated apologies
together with the influence of the Cecils and the pressure of so
formidable and so useful a man as Coke turned the scale against Essex
In April      Coke was made Attorney Coke did not forget the
pretender to law as he would think him who had dared so long to
dispute his claims and Bacon was deeply wounded No man he thought
had ever received a more exquisite disgrace and he spoke of retiring
to Cambridge to spend the rest of his life in his studies and
contemplations But Essex was not discouraged He next pressed eagerly
for the Solicitorship Again after much waiting he was foiled An
inferior man was put over Bacon's head Bacon found that Essex who
could do most things for some reason could not do this He himself
too had pressed his suit with the greatest importunity on the Queen on
Burghley on Cecil on every one who could help him he reminded the
Queen how many years ago it was since he first kissed her hand in her
service and ever since had used his wits to please but it was all in
vain For once he lost patience He was angry with Essex the Queen's
anger with Essex had he thought recoiled on his friend He was angry
with the Queen she held his long waiting cheap she played with him and
amused herself with delay he would go abroad and he knew her
Majesty's nature that she neither careth though the whole surname of
the Bacons travelled nor of the Cecils neither He was very angry
with Robert Cecil affecting not to believe them he tells him stories
he has heard of his corrupt and underhand dealing He writes almost a
farewell letter of ceremonious but ambiguous thanks to Lord Burghley
hoping that he would impute any offence that Bacon might have given to
the complexion of a suitor and a tired sea-sick suitor and speaking
despairingly of his future success in the law The humiliations of what
a suitor has to go through torment him It is my luck he writes to
Cecil still to be akin to such things as I neither like in nature nor
would willingly meet with in my course but yet cannot avoid without
show of base timorousness or else of unkind or suspicious strangeness
And to his friend Fulke Greville he thus unburdens himself

     SIR I understand of your pains to have visited me for which I
     thank you My matter is an endless question I assure you I had
     said Requiesce anima mea but I now am otherwise put to my
     psalter Nolite confidere I dare go no further Her Majesty had
     by set speech more than once assured me of her intention to call me
     to her service which I could not understand but of the place I had
     been named to And now whether invidus homo hoc fecit or whether
     my matter must be an appendix to my Lord of Essex suit or whether
     her Majesty pretending to prove my ability meaneth but to take
     advantage of some errors which like enough at one time or other I
     may commit or what is it but her Majesty is not ready to despatch
     it And what though the Master of the Rolls and my Lord of Essex
     and yourself and others think my case without doubt yet in the
     meantime I have a hard condition to stand so that whatsoever
     service I do to her Majesty it shall be thought to be but
     servitium viscatum lime-twigs and fetches to place myself and
     so I shall have envy not thanks This is a course to quench all
     good spirits and to corrupt every man's nature which will I
     fear much hurt her Majesty's service in the end I have been like
     a piece of stuff bespoken in the shop and if her Majesty will not
     take me it may be the selling by parcels will be more gainful For
     to be as I told you like a child following a bird which when he
     is nearest flieth away and lighteth a little before and then the
     child after it again and so in infinitum I am weary of it as
     also of wearying my good friends of whom nevertheless I hope in
     one course or other gratefully to deserve And so not forgetting
     your business I leave to trouble you with this idle letter being
     but justa et moderata querimonia for indeed I do confess
     primus amor will not easily be cast off And thus again I commend
     me to you

After one more effort the chase was given up at least for the moment
for it was soon resumed But just now Bacon felt that all the world was
against him He would retire out of the sunshine into the shade One
friend only encouraged him He did more He helped him when Bacon most
wanted help in his straitened and embarrassed estate Essex when he
could do nothing more gave Bacon an estate worth at least £    
Bacon's resolution is recorded in the following letter

     IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP I pray God her Majesty's
     weighing be not like the weight of a balance gravia deorsum levia
     sursum But I am as far from being altered in devotion towards
     her as I am from distrust that she will be altered in opinion
     towards me when she knoweth me better For myself I have lost
     some opinion some time and some means this is my account but
     then for opinion it is a blast that goeth and cometh for time it
     is true it goeth and cometh not but yet I have learned that it may
     be redeemed For means I value that most and the rather because
     I am purposed not to follow the practice of the law if her
     Majesty command me in any particular I shall be ready to do her
     willing service and my reason is only because it drinketh too
     much time which I have dedicated to better purposes But even for
     that point of estate and means I partly lean to Thales' opinion
     That a philosopher may be rich if he will Thus your Lordship seeth
     how I comfort myself to the increase whereof I would fain please
     myself to believe that to be true which my Lord Treasurer writeth
     which is that it is more than a philosopher morally can disgest
     But without any such high conceit I esteem it like the pulling out
     of an aching tooth which I remember when I was a child and had
     little philosophy I was glad of when it was done For your
     Lordship I do think myself more beholding to you than to any man
     And I say I reckon myself as a common not popular but
     common and as much as is lawful to be enclosed of a common so
     much your Lordship shall be sure to have Your Lordship's to obey
     your honourable commands more settled than ever

It may be that as Bacon afterwards maintained the closing sentences of
this letter implied a significant reserve of his devotion But during
the brilliant and stormy years of Essex's career which followed Bacon's
relations to him continued unaltered Essex pressed Bacon's claims
whenever a chance offered He did his best to get Bacon a rich wife the
young widow of Sir Christopher Hatton but in vain Instead of Bacon she
accepted Coke and became famous afterwards in the great family quarrel
in which Coke and Bacon again found themselves face to face and which
nearly ruined Bacon before the time Bacon worked for Essex when he was
wanted and gave the advice which a shrewd and cautious friend would
give to a man who by his success and increasing pride and
self-confidence was running into serious dangers arming against
himself deadly foes and exposing himself to the chances of fortune
Bacon was nervous about Essex's capacity for war a capacity which
perhaps was not proved even by the most brilliant exploit of the time
the capture of Cadiz in which Essex foreshadowed the heroic but
well-calculated audacities of Nelson and Cochrane and showed himself as
little able as they to bear the intoxication of success and to work in
concert with envious and unfriendly associates At the end of the year
     the year in which Essex had won such reputation at Cadiz Bacon
wrote him a letter of advice and remonstrance It is a lively picture
of the defects and dangers of Essex's behaviour as the Queen's
favourite and it is a most characteristic and worldly-wise summary of
the ways which Bacon would have him take to cure the one and escape the
other Bacon had as he says good reason to think that the Earl's
fortune comprehended his own And the letter may perhaps be taken as an
indirect warning to Essex that Bacon must at any rate take care of his
own fortune if the Earl persisted in dangerous courses Bacon shows how
he is to remove the impressions strong in the Queen's mind of Essex's
defects how he is by due submissions and stratagems to catch her
humour 

     But whether I counsel you the best or for the best duty bindeth
     me to offer to you my wishes I said to your Lordship last time
     Martha Martha attendis ad plurima unum sufficit win the
     Queen if this be not the beginning of any other course I see no
     end

Bacon gives a series of minute directions how Essex is to disarm the
Queen's suspicions and to neutralize the advantage which his rivals
take of them how he is to remove the opinion of his nature being
opiniastre and not rulable how avoiding the faults of Leicester and
Hatton he is as far as he can to allege them for authors and
patterns Especially he must give up that show of soldier-like
distinction which the Queen so disliked and take some quiet post at
Court He must not alarm the Queen by seeking popularity he must take
care of his estate he must get rid of some of his officers and he must
not be disquieted by other favourites

Bacon wished as he said afterwards to see him with a white staff in
his hand as my Lord of Leicester had an honour and ornament to the
Court in the eyes of the people and foreign ambassadors But Essex was
not fit for the part which Bacon urged upon him that of an obsequious
and vigilant observer of the Queen's moods and humours As time went on
things became more and more difficult between him and his strange
mistress and there were never wanting men who like Cecil and Raleigh
for good and bad reasons feared and hated Essex and who had the craft
and the skill to make the most of his inexcusable errors At last he
allowed himself from ambition from the spirit of contradiction from
the blind passion for doing what he thought would show defiance to his
enemies to be tempted into the Irish campaign of      Bacon at a later
time claimed credit for having foreseen and foretold its issue I did
as plainly see his overthrow chained as it were by destiny to that
journey as it is possible for any man to ground a judgment on future
contingents He warned Essex so he thought in after years of the
difficulty of the work he warned him that he would leave the Queen in
the hands of his enemies It would be ill for her ill for him ill for
the State I am sure he adds I never in anything in my life dealt
with him in like earnestness by speech by writing and by all the means
I could devise But Bacon's memory was mistaken We have his letters
When Essex went to Ireland Bacon wrote only in the language of sanguine
hope so little did he see overthrow chained by destiny to that
journey that some good spirit led his pen to presage to his Lordship
success he saw in the enterprise a great occasion of honour to his
friend he gave prudent counsels but he looked forward confidently to
Essex being as fatal a captain to that war as Africanus was to the war
of Carthage Indeed however anxious he may have been he could not
have foreseen Essex's unaccountable and to this day unintelligible
failure But failure was the end from whatever cause failure
disgraceful and complete Then followed wild and guilty but abortive
projects for retrieving his failure by using his power in Ireland to
make himself formidable to his enemies at Court and even to the Queen
herself He intrigued with Tyrone he intrigued with James of Scotland
he plunged into a whirl of angry and baseless projects which came to
nothing the moment they were discussed How empty and idle they were was
shown by his return against orders to tell his own story at Nonsuch and
by thus placing himself alone and undeniably in the wrong in the power
of the hostile Council Of course it was not to be thought of that Cecil
should not use his advantage in the game It was too early irritated
though the Queen was to strike the final blow But it is impossible not
to see looking back over the miserable history that Essex was treated
in a way which was certain sooner or later to make him being what he
was plunge into a fatal and irretrievable mistake He was treated as a
cat treats a mouse he was worried confined disgraced publicly
reprimanded brought just within verge of the charge of treason but not
quite just enough to discredit and alarm him but to leave him still a
certain amount of play He was made to see that the Queen's favour was
not quite hopeless but that nothing but the most absolute and
unreserved humiliation could recover it It was plain to any one who
knew Essex that this treatment would drive Essex to madness These same
gradations of yours so Bacon represents himself expostulating with the
Queen on her caprices are fitter to corrupt than to correct any mind
of greatness They made Essex desperate he became frightened for his
life and he had reason to be so though not in the way which he feared
At length came the stupid and ridiculous outbreak of the  th of
February          a plot to seize the palace and raise the city
against the ministers by the help of a few gentlemen armed only with
their rapiers As Bacon himself told the Queen if some base and
cruel-minded persons had entered into such an action it might have
caused much blow and combustion but it appeared well that they were
such as knew not how to play the malefactors! But it was sufficient to
bring Essex within the doom of treason

Essex knew well what the stake was He lost it and deserved to lose it
little as his enemies deserved to win it for they too were doing what
would have cost them their heads if Elizabeth had known
it corresponding as Essex was accused of doing with Scotland about
the succession and possibly with Spain But they were playing
cautiously and craftily he with bungling passion He had been so long
accustomed to power and place that he could not endure that rivals
should keep him out of it They were content to have their own way
while affecting to be the humblest of servants he would be nothing less
than a Mayor of the Palace He was guilty of a great public crime as
every man is who appeals to arms for anything short of the most sacred
cause He was bringing into England which had settled down into
peaceable ways an imitation of the violent methods of France and the
Guises But the crime as well as the penalty belonged to the age and
crimes legally said to be against the State mean morally very different
things according to the state of society and opinion It is an
unfairness verging on the ridiculous when the ground is elaborately
laid for keeping up the impression that Essex was preparing a real
treason against the Queen like that of Norfolk It was a treason of the
same sort and order as that for which Northumberland sent Somerset to
the block the treason of being an unsuccessful rival

Meanwhile Bacon had been getting gradually into the unofficial employ of
the Government He had become one of the Learned Counsel lawyers with
subordinate and intermittent work used when wanted but without patent
or salary and not ranking with the regular law officers The Government
had found him useful in affairs of the revenue in framing
interrogatories for prisoners in the Tower in drawing up reports of
plots against the Queen He did not in this way earn enough to support
himself but he had thus come to have some degree of access to the
Queen which he represents as being familiar and confidential though he
still perceived as he says himself that she did not like him At the
first news of Essex's return to England Bacon greeted him 

     MY LORD Conceiving that your Lordship came now up in the person
     of a good servant to see your sovereign mistress which kind of
     compliments are many times instar magnorum meritorum and
     therefore it would be hard for me to find you I have committed to
     this poor paper the humble salutations of him that is more yours
     than any man's and more yours than any man To these salutations
     I add a due and joyful gratulation confessing that your Lordship
     in your last conference with me before your journey spake not in
     vain God making it good That you trusted we should say Quis
     putasset! Which as it is found true in a happy sense so I wish
     you do not find another Quis putasset in the manner of taking
     this so great a service But I hope it is as he said Nubecula
     est cito transibit and that your Lordship's wisdom and
     obsequious circumspection and patience will turn all to the best
     So referring all to some time that I may attend you I commit you
     to God's best preservation

But when Essex's conduct in Ireland had to be dealt with Bacon's
services were called for and from this time his relations towards Essex
were altered Every one no one better than the Queen herself knew all
that he owed to Essex It is strangely illustrative of the time that
especially as Bacon held so subordinate a position he should have been
required and should have been trusted to act against his only and most
generous benefactor It is strange too that however great his loyalty
to the Queen however much and sincerely he might condemn his friend's
conduct he should think it possible to accept the task He says that he
made some remonstrance and he says no doubt truly that during the
first stage of the business he used the ambiguous position in which he
was placed to soften Essex's inevitable punishment and to bring about a
reconciliation between him and the Queen But he was required as the
Queen's lawyer to set forth in public Essex's offences and he admits
that he did so not over tenderly Yet all this even if we have
misgivings about it is intelligible If he had declined he could not
perhaps have done the service which he assures us that he tried to do
for Essex and it is certain that he would have had to reckon with the
terrible lady who in her old age still ruled England from the throne of
Henry VIII and who had certainly no great love for Bacon himself She
had already shown him in a much smaller matter what was the forfeit to
be paid for any resistance to her will All the hopes of his life must
perish all the grudging and suspicious favours which he had won with
such unremitting toil and patient waiting would be sacrificed and he
would henceforth live under the wrath of those who never forgave And
whatever he did for himself he believed that he was serving Essex His
scheming imagination and his indefatigable pen were at work He tried
strange indirect methods he invented a correspondence between his
brother and Essex which was to fall into the Queen's hands in order to
soften her wrath and show her Essex's most secret feelings When the
Queen proposed to dine with him at his lodge in Twickenham Park though
I profess not to be a poet he prepared a sonnet tending and alluding
to draw on her Majesty's reconcilement to my Lord It was an awkward
thing for one who had been so intimate with Essex to be so deep in the
counsels of those who hated him He complains that many people thought
him ungrateful and disloyal to his friend and that stories circulated
to his disadvantage as if he were poisoning the Queen's ear against
Essex But he might argue fairly enough that wilful and wrong-headed as
Essex had been it was the best that he could now do for him and as
long as it was only a question of Essex's disgrace and enforced absence
from Court Bacon could not be bound to give up the prospects of his
life indeed his public duty as a subordinate servant of government on
account of his friend's inexcusable and dangerous follies Essex did not
see it so and in the subjoined correspondence had the advantage but
Bacon's position though a higher one might be imagined where men had
been such friends as these two men had been is quite a defensible one

     MY LORD No man can better expound my doings than your Lordship
     which maketh me need to say the less Only I humbly pray you to
     believe that I aspire to the conscience and commendation first of
     bonus civis which with us is a good and true servant to the
     Queen and next of bonus vir that is an honest man I desire
     your Lordship also to think that though I confess I love some
     things much better than I love your Lordship as the Queen's
     service her quiet and contentment her honour her favour the
     good of my country and the like yet I love few persons better
     than yourself both for gratitude's sake and for your own virtues
     which cannot hurt but by accident or abuse Of which my good
     affection I was ever ready and am ready to yield testimony by any
     good offices but with such reservations as yourself cannot but
     allow for as I was ever sorry that your Lordship should fly with
     waxen wings doubting Icarus's fortune so for the growing up of
     your own feathers specially ostrich's or any other save of a bird
     of prey no man shall be more glad And this is the axletree
     whereupon I have turned and shall turn which to signify to you
     though I think you are of yourself persuaded as much is the cause
     of my writing and so I commend your Lordship to God's goodness
     From Gray's Inn this   th day of July     

     Your Lordship's most humbly
     FR BACON

To this letter Essex returned an answer of dignified reserve such as
Bacon might himself have dictated 

     MR BACON I can neither expound nor censure your late actions
     being ignorant of all of them save one and having directed my
     sight inward only to examine myself You do pray me to believe
     that you only aspire to the conscience and commendation of bonus
     civis and bonus vir and I do faithfully assure you that while
     that is your ambition though your course be active and mine
     contemplative yet we shall both convenire in codem tertio and
     convenire inter nosipsos Your profession of affection and offer
     of good offices are welcome to me For answer to them I will say
     but this that you have believed I have been kind to you and you
     may believe that I cannot be other either upon humour or my own
     election I am a stranger to all poetical conceits or else I
     should say somewhat of your poetical example But this I must say
     that I never flew with other wings than desire to merit and
     confidence in my Sovereign's favour and when one of these wings
     failed me I would light nowhere but at my Sovereign's feet though
     she suffered me to be bruised with my fall And till her Majesty
     that knows I was never bird of prey finds it to agree with her
     will and her service that my wings should be imped again I have
     committed myself to the mire No power but my God's and my
     Sovereign's can alter this resolution of

     Your retired friend
     ESSEX

But after Essex's mad attempt in the city a new state of things arose
The inevitable result was a trial for high treason a trial of which no
one could doubt the purpose and end The examination of accomplices
revealed speeches proposals projects not very intelligible to us in
the still imperfectly understood game of intrigue that was going on
among all parties at the end of Elizabeth's reign but quite enough to
place Essex at the mercy of the Government and the offended Queen The
new information says Mr Spedding had been immediately communicated
to Coke and Bacon Coke as Attorney-General of course conducted the
prosecution and the next prominent person on the side of the Crown was
not the Solicitor or any other regular law officer but Bacon though
holding the very subordinate place of one of the Learned Counsel

It does not appear that he thought it strange that he showed any pain
or reluctance that he sought to be excused He took it as a matter of
course The part assigned to Bacon in the prosecution was as important
as that of Coke and he played it more skilfully and effectively Trials
in those days were confused affairs often passing into a mere wrangle
between the judges lawyers and lookers-on and the prisoner at the
bar It was so in this case Coke is said to have blundered in his way
of presenting the evidence and to have been led away from the point
into an altercation with Essex Probably it really did not much matter
but the trial was getting out of its course and inclining in favour of
the prisoner till Bacon Mr Spedding thinks out of his regular
turn stepped forward and retrieved matters This is Mr Spedding's
account of what Bacon said and did

     By this time the argument had drifted so far away from the point
     that it must have been difficult for a listener to remember what it
     was that the prisoners were charged with or how much of the charge
     had been proved And Coke who was all this time the sole speaker
     on behalf of the Crown was still following each fresh topic that
     rose before him without the sign of an intention or the intimation
     of a wish to return to the main question and reform the broken
     ranks of his evidence Luckily he seems to have been now at a loss
     what point to take next and the pause gave Bacon an opportunity of
     rising It can hardly have been in pursuance of previous
     arrangements for though it was customary in those days to
     distribute the evidence into parts and to assign several parts to
     several counsel there had been no appearance as yet of any part
     being concluded It is probable that the course of the trial had
     upset previous arrangements and confused the parts At any rate so
     it was however it came to pass that when Cecil and Essex had at
     last finished their expostulation and parted with charitable
     prayers each that the other might be forgiven then says our
     reporter Mr Bacon entered into a speech much after this fashion

     'In speaking of this late and horrible rebellion which hath been
     in the eyes and ears of all men I shall save myself much labour in
     opening and enforcing the points thereof insomuch as I speak not
     before a country jury of ignorant men but before a most honourable
     assembly of the greatest Peers of the land whose wisdoms conceive
     far more than my tongue can utter yet with your gracious and
     honourable favours I will presume if not for information of your
     Honours yet for the discharge of my duty to say thus much No man
     can be ignorant that knows matters of former ages and all history
     makes it plain that there was never any traitor heard of that
     durst directly attempt the seat of his liege prince but he always
     coloured his practices with some plausible pretence For God hath
     imprinted such a majesty in the face of a prince that no private
     man dare approach the person of his sovereign with a traitorous
     intent And therefore they run another side course oblique et à
     latere some to reform corruptions of the State and religion some
     to reduce the ancient liberties and customs pretended to be lost
     and worn out some to remove those persons that being in high
     places make themselves subject to envy but all of them aim at the
     overthrow of the State and destruction of the present rulers And
     this likewise is the use of those that work mischief of another
     quality as Cain that first murderer took up an excuse for his
     fact shaming to outface it with impudency thus the Earl made his
     colour the severing some great men and councillors from her
     Majesty's favour and the fear he stood in of his pretended enemies
     lest they should murder him in his house Therefore he saith he
     was compelled to fly into the City for succour and assistance not
     much unlike Pisistratus of whom it was so anciently written how he
     gashed and wounded himself and in that sort ran crying into Athens
     that his life was sought and like to have been taken away thinking
     to have moved the people to have pitied him and taken his part by
     such counterfeited harm and danger whereas his aim and drift was
     to take the government of the city into his hands and alter the
     form thereof With like pretences of dangers and assaults the Earl
     of Essex entered the City of London and passed through the bowels
     thereof blanching rumours that he should have been murdered and
     that the State was sold whereas he had no such enemies no such
     dangers persuading themselves that if they could prevail all would
     have done well But now magna scelera terminantur in hæresin for
     you my Lord should know that though princes give their subjects
     cause of discontent though they take away the honours they have
     heaped upon them though they bring them to a lower estate than
     they raised them from yet ought they not to be so forgetful of
     their allegiance that they should enter into any undutiful act
     much less upon rebellion as you my Lord have done All
     whatsoever you have or can say in answer hereof are but shadows
     And therefore methinks it were best for you to confess not to
     justify'

Essex was provoked by Bacon's incredulous sneer about enemies and
dangers I call forth Mr Bacon against Mr Bacon and referred to the
letters which Bacon had written in his name and in which these
dangerous enmities were taken for granted Bacon in answer repeated
what he said so often That he had spent more time in vain in studying
how to make the Earl a good servant to the Queen and State than he had
done in anything else Once more Coke got the proceedings into a
tangle and once more Bacon came forward to repair the miscarriage of
his leader

     'I have never yet seen in any case such favour shown to any
     prisoner so many digressions such delivering of evidence by
     fractions and so silly a defence of such great and notorious
     treasons May it please your Grace you have seen how weakly he
     hath shadowed his purpose and how slenderly he hath answered the
     objections against him But my Lord I doubt the variety of
     matters and the many digressions may minister occasion of
     forgetfulness and may have severed the judgments of the Lords and
     therefore I hold it necessary briefly to recite the Judges'
     opinions'

     That being done he proceeded to this effect

     'Now put the case that the Earl of Essex's intents were as he
     would have it believed to go only as a suppliant to her Majesty
     Shall their petitions be presented by armed petitioners This must
     needs bring loss of property to the prince Neither is it any point
     of law as my Lord of Southampton would have it believed that
     condemns them of treason To take secret counsel to execute it to
     run together in numbers armed with weapons what can be the excuse
     Warned by the Lord Keeper by a herald and yet persist! Will any
     simple man take this to be less than treason'

     The Earl of Essex answered that if he had purposed anything
     against others than those his private enemies he would not have
     stirred with so slender a company Whereunto Mr Bacon answered

     'It was not the company you carried with you but the assistance
     you hoped for in the City which you trusted unto The Duke of Guise
     thrust himself into the streets of Paris on the day of the
     Barricades in his doublet and hose attended only with eight
     gentlemen and found that help in the city which thanks be to God
     you failed of here And what followed The King was forced to put
     himself into a pilgrim's weeds and in that disguise to steal away
     to scape their fury Even such was my Lord's confidence too and
     his pretence the same an all-hail and a kiss to the City But the
     end was treason as hath been sufficiently proved But when he had
     once delivered and engaged himself so far into that which the
     shallowness of his conceit could not accomplish as he expected the
     Queen for her defence taking arms against him he was glad to yield
     himself and thinking to colour his practices turned his pretexts
     and alleged the occasion thereof to proceed from a private
     quarrel'

     To this adds the reporter the Earl answered little Nor was
     anything said afterwards by either of the prisoners either in the
     thrust-and-parry dialogue with Coke that followed or when they
     spoke at large to the question why judgment should not be
     pronounced which at all altered the complexion of the case They
     were both found guilty and sentence passed in the usual form

Bacon's legal position was so subordinate a place that there must have
been a special reason for his employment It is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that on the part of the Government Bacon was thus used for
the very reason that he had been the friend of Essex He was not
commonly called upon in such prosecutions He was not employed by Cecil
in the Winchester trials of Raleigh Grey and Cobham three years
afterwards nor in those connected with the Gunpowder Plot He was
called upon now because no one could so much damage Essex and this last
proof of his ready service was required by those whose favour since
Essex had gone hopelessly wrong he had been diligently seeking And
Bacon acquiesced in the demand apparently without surprise No record
remains to show that he felt any difficulty in playing his part He had
persuaded himself that his public duty his duty as a good citizen to
the Queen and the commonwealth demanded of him that he should obey the
call to do his best to bring a traitor to punishment

Public duty has claims on a man as well as friendship and in many
conceivable cases claims paramount to those of friendship And yet
friendship too has claims at least on a man's memory Essex had been
a dear friend if words could mean anything He had done more than any
man had done for Bacon generously and nobly and Bacon had acknowledged
it in the amplest terms Only a year before he had written I am as
much yours as any man's and as much yours as any man It is not and
it was not a question of Essex's guilt It may be a question whether
the whole matter was not exaggerated as to its purpose as it certainly
was as to its real danger and mischief We at least know that his
rivals dabbled in intrigue and foolish speeches as well as he that
little more than two years afterwards Raleigh and Grey and Cobham were
condemned for treason in much the same fashion as he was that Cecil to
the end of his days with whatever purpose was a pensioner of Spain
The question was not whether Essex was guilty The question for Bacon
was whether it was becoming in him having been what he had been to
Essex to take a leading part in proceedings which were to end in his
ruin and death He was not a judge He was not a regular law officer
like Coke His only employment had been casual and occasional He might
most naturally on the score of his old friendship have asked to be
excused Condemning as he did his friend's guilt and folly he might
have refused to take part in a cause of blood in which his best friend
must perish He might honestly have given up Essex as incorrigible and
have retired to stand apart in sorrow and silence while the inevitable
tragedy was played out The only answer to this is that to have
declined would have incurred the Queen's displeasure he would have
forfeited any chance of advancement nay closely connected as he had
been with Essex he might have been involved in his friend's ruin But
inferior men have marred their fortunes by standing by their friends in
not undeserved trouble and no one knew better than Bacon what was
worthy and noble in human action The choice lay before him He seems
hardly to have gone through any struggle He persuaded himself that he
could not help himself under the constraint of his duty to the Queen
and he did his best to get Essex condemned

And this was not all The death of Essex was a shock to the popularity
of Elizabeth greater than anything that had happened in her long reign
Bacon's name also had come into men's mouths as that of a time-server
who played fast and loose with Essex and his enemies and who when he
had got what he could from Essex turned to see what he could get from
those who put him to death A justification of the whole affair was felt
to be necessary and Bacon was fixed upon for the distinction and the
dishonour of doing it No one could tell the story so well and it was
felt that he would not shrink from it Nor did he In cold blood he sat
down to blacken Essex using his intimate personal knowledge of the past
to strengthen his statements against a friend who was in his grave and
for whom none could answer but Bacon himself It is a well-compacted and
forcible account of Essex's misdoings on which of course the colour of
deliberate and dangerous treason was placed Much of it no doubt was
true but even of the facts and much more of the colour there was no
check to be had and it is certain that it was an object to the
Government to make out the worst It is characteristic that Bacon
records that he did not lose sight of the claims of courtesy and
studiously spoke of my Lord of Essex in the draft submitted for
correction to the Queen but she was more unceremonious and insisted
that the rebel should be spoken of simply as Essex

After a business of this kind fines and forfeitures flowed in
abundantly and were usually bestowed on deserving servants or favoured
suitors by way of reward and Bacon came in for his share Out of one
of the fines he received £     The Queen hath done something for me
he writes to a friendly creditor though not in the proportion I had
hoped and he afterwards asked for something more It was rather under
the value of Essex's gift to him in      But she still refused him all
promotion He was without an official place in the Queen's service and
he never was allowed to have it It is clear that the Declaration of
the Treason of the Earl of Essex if it justified the Government did
not remove the odium which had fallen on Bacon Mr Spedding says that
he can find no signs of it The proof of it is found in the Apology
which Bacon found it expedient to write after Elizabeth's death and
early in James's reign He found that the recollection of the way in
which he had dealt with his friend hung heavy upon him men hesitated to
trust him in spite of his now recognised ability Accordingly he drew
up an apology which he addressed to Lord Mountjoy the friend in
reality half the accomplice of Essex in his wild ill-defined plan for
putting pressure on Elizabeth It is a clear able of course ex parte
statement of the doings of the three chief actors two of whom could no
longer answer for themselves or correct and contradict the third It
represents the Queen as implacable and cruel Essex as incorrigibly and
outrageously wilful proud and undutiful Bacon himself as using every
effort and device to appease the Queen's anger and suspiciousness and
to bring Essex to a wiser and humbler mind The picture is indeed a
vivid one and full of dramatic force of an unrelenting and merciless
mistress bent on breaking and bowing down to the dust the haughty spirit
of a once-loved but rebellious favourite whom though he has deeply
offended she yet wishes to bring once more under her yoke and of the
calm keen-witted looker-on watching the dangerous game not without
personal interest but with undisturbed presence of mind and doing his
best to avert an irreparable and fatal breach How far he honestly did
his best for his misguided friend we can only know from his own report
but there is no reason to think that he did Essex ill service though
he notices in passing an allegation that the Queen in one of her angry
fits had charged him with this But his interest clearly was to make up
the quarrel between the Queen and Essex Bacon would have been a greater
man with both of them if he had been able to do so He had been too
deeply in Essex's intimacy to make his new position of mediator with a
strong bias on the Queen's side quite safe and easy for a man of
honourable mind but a cool-judging and prudent man may well have acted
as he represents himself acting without forgetting what he owed to his
friend Till the last great moment of trial there is a good deal to be
said for Bacon a man keenly alive to Essex's faults with a strong
sense of what he owed to the Queen and the State and with his own
reasonable chances of rising greatly prejudiced by Essex's folly But at
length came the crisis which showed the man and threw light on all that
had passed before when he was picked out out of his regular place to
be charged with the task of bringing home the capital charge against
Essex He does not say he hesitated He does not say that he asked to be
excused the terrible office He did not flinch as the minister of
vengeance for those who required that Essex should die He did his work
we are told by his admiring biographer better than Coke and repaired
the blunders of the prosecution He passes over very shortly this part
of the business It was laid upon me with the rest of my fellows yet
it is the knot and key of the whole as far as his own character is
concerned Bacon had his public duty his public duty may have compelled
him to stand apart from Essex But it was his interest it was no part
of his public duty which required him to accept the task of accuser of
his friend and in his friend's direst need calmly to drive home a
well-directed stroke that should extinguish chances and hopes and make
his ruin certain No one who reads his anxious letters about preferment
and the Queen's favour about his disappointed hopes about his
straitened means and distress for money about his difficulties with his
creditors he was twice arrested for debt can doubt that the question
was between his own prospects and his friend and that to his own
interest he sacrificed his friend and his own honour




CHAPTER III

BACON AND JAMES I


Bacon's life was a double one There was the life of high thinking of
disinterested aims of genuine enthusiasm of genuine desire to delight
and benefit mankind by opening new paths to wonder and knowledge and
power And there was the put on and worldly life the life of supposed
necessities for the provision of daily bread the life of ambition and
self-seeking which he followed not without interest and satisfaction
but at bottom because he thought he must must be a great man must be
rich must live in the favour of the great because without it his great
designs could not be accomplished His original plan of life was
disclosed in his letter to Lord Burghley to get some office with an
assured income and not much work and then to devote the best of his
time to his own subjects But this if it was really his plan was
gradually changed first because he could not get such a place and
next because his connection with Essex the efforts to gain him the
Attorney's place and the use which the Queen made of him after Essex
could do no more for him drew him more and more into public work and
specially the career of the law We know that he would not by preference
have chosen the law and did not feel that his vocation lay that way
but it was the only way open to him for mending his fortunes And so
the two lives went on side by side the worldly one he would have said
the practical one often interfering with the life of thought and
discovery and partly obscuring it but yet always leaving it paramount
in his own mind His dearest and most cherished ideas the thoughts with
which he was most at home and happiest his deepest and truest
ambitions were those of an enthusiastic and romantic believer in a
great discovery just within his grasp They were such as the dreams and
visions of his great Franciscan namesake and of the imaginative seekers
after knowledge in the middle ages real or mythical Albert the Great
Cornelius Agrippa Dr Faustus they were the eager undoubting hopes of
the physical students in Italy and England in his own time Giordano
Bruno Telesio Campanella Gilbert Galileo or the founders of the
Italian prototype of Solomon's House in the New Atlantis the
precursor of our Royal Societies the Academy of the Lincei at Rome
Among these meditations was his inner life But however he may have
originally planned his course and though at times under the influence
of disappointment he threatened to retire to Cambridge or to travel
abroad he had bound himself fast to public life and soon ceased to
think of quitting it And he had a real taste for it for its shows its
prizes for the laws and turns of the game for its debates and
vicissitudes He was no mere idealist or recluse to undervalue or
despise the real grandeur of the world He took the keenest interest in
the nature and ways of mankind he liked to observe to generalise in
shrewd and sometimes cynical epigrams He liked to apply his powerful
and fertile intellect to the practical problems of society and
government to their curious anomalies to their paradoxical phenomena
he liked to address himself either as an expounder or a reformer to
the principles and entanglements of English law he aspired both as a
lecturer and a legislator to improve and simplify it It was not beyond
his hopes to shape a policy to improve administration to become
powerful by bringing his sagacity and largeness of thought to the
service of the State in reconciling conflicting forces in mediating
between jealous parties and dangerous claims And he liked to enter into
the humours of a Court to devote his brilliant imagination and
affluence of invention either to devising a pageant which should throw
all others into the shade or a compromise which should get great
persons out of some difficulty of temper or pique

In all these things he was as industrious as laborious as calmly
persevering and tenacious as he was in his pursuit of his philosophical
speculations He was a compound of the most adventurous and most
diversified ambition with a placid and patient temper such as we
commonly associate with moderate desires and the love of retirement and
an easy life To imagine and dare anything and never to let go the
object of his pursuit is one side of him on the other he is
obsequiously desirous to please and fearful of giving offence the
humblest and most grateful and also the most importunate of suitors
ready to bide his time with an even cheerfulness of spirit which yet it
was not safe to provoke by ill offices and the wish to thwart him He
never misses a chance of proffering his services he never lets pass an
opportunity of recommending himself to those who could help him He is
so bent on natural knowledge that we have a sense of incongruity when we
see him engaging in politics as if he had no other interest He throws
himself with such zest into the language of the moralist the
theologian the historian that we forget we have before us the author
of a new departure in physical inquiry and the unwearied compiler of
tables of natural history When he is a lawyer he seems only a lawyer
If he had not been the author of the Instauratio his life would not
have looked very different from that of any other of the shrewd and
supple lawyers who hung on to the Tudor and Stuart Courts and who
unscrupulously pushed their way to preferment He claimed to be in
spite of the misgivings of Elizabeth and her ministers as devoted to
public work and as capable of it as any of them He was ready for
anything for any amount of business ready as in everything to take
infinite trouble about it The law if he did not like it was yet no
by-work with him he was as truly ambitious as the men with whom he
maintained so keen and for long so unsuccessful a rivalry He felt
bitterly the disappointment of seeing men like Coke and Fleming and
Doddridge and Hobart pass before him he could not if he had been only
a lawyer have coveted more eagerly the places refused to him which
they got only he had besides a whole train of purposes an inner and
supreme ambition of which they knew nothing And with all this there is
no apparent consciousness of these manifold and varied interests He
never affected to conceal from himself his superiority to other men in
his aims and in the grasp of his intelligence But there is no trace
that he prided himself on the variety and versatility of these powers
or that he even distinctly realized to himself that it was anything
remarkable that he should have so many dissimilar objects and be able so
readily to pursue them in such different directions

It is doubtful whether as long as Elizabeth lived Bacon could ever
have risen above his position among the Learned Counsel an office
without patent or salary or regular employment She used him and he
was willing to be used but he plainly did not appear in her eyes to be
the kind of man who would suit her in the more prominent posts of her
Government Unusual and original ability is apt till it is generally
recognised to carry with it suspicion and mistrust as to its being
really all that it seems to be Perhaps she thought of the possibility
of his flying out unexpectedly at some inconvenient pinch and
attempting to serve her interests not in her way but in his own
perhaps she distrusted in business and state affairs so brilliant a
discourser whose heart was known first and above all to be set on
great dreams of knowledge perhaps those interviews with her in which he
describes the counsels which he laid before her and in which his
shrewdness and foresight are conspicuous may not have been so welcome
to her as he imagined perhaps it is not impossible that he may have
been too compliant for her capricious taste and too visibly anxious to
please Perhaps too she could not forget in spite of what had
happened that he had been the friend and not the very generous friend
of Essex But except as to a share of the forfeitures with which he
was not satisfied his fortunes did not rise under Elizabeth

Whatever may have been the Queen's feelings towards him there is no
doubt that one powerful influence which lasted into the reign of James
was steadily adverse to his advancement Burghley had been strangely
niggardly in what he did to help his brilliant nephew he was going off
the scene and probably did not care to trouble himself about a younger
and uncongenial aspirant to service But his place was taken by his son
Robert Cecil and Cecil might naturally have been expected to welcome
the co-operation of one of his own family who was foremost among the
rising men of Cecil's own generation and who certainly was most
desirous to do him service But it is plain that he early made up his
mind to keep Bacon in the background It is easy to imagine reasons
though the apparent short-sightedness of the policy may surprise us but
Cecil was too reticent and self-controlled a man to let his reasons
appear and his words in answer to his cousin's applications for his
assistance were always kind encouraging and vague But we must judge
by the event and that makes it clear that Cecil did not care to see
Bacon in high position Nothing can account for Bacon's strange failure
for so long a time to reach his due place in the public service but the
secret hostility whatever may have been the cause of Cecil

There was also another difficulty Coke was the great lawyer of the day
a man whom the Government could not dispense with and whom it was
dangerous to offend And Coke thoroughly disliked Bacon He thought
lightly of his law and he despised his refinement and his passion for
knowledge He cannot but have resented the impertinence as he must have
thought it of Bacon having been for a whole year his rival for office
It is possible that if people then agreed with Mr Spedding's opinion as
to the management of Essex's trial he may have been irritated by
jealousy but a couple of months after the trial April         Bacon
sent to Cecil with a letter of complaint the following account of a
scene in Court between Coke and himself


     A true remembrance of the abuse I received of Mr
     Attorney-General publicly in the Exchequer the first day of term
     for the truth whereof I refer myself to all that were present

     I moved to have a reseizure of the lands of Geo Moore a relapsed
     recusant a fugitive and a practising traytor and showed better
     matter for the Queen against the discharge by plea which is ever
     with a salvo jure And this I did in as gentle and reasonable
     terms as might be

     Mr Attorney kindled at it and said 'Mr Bacon if you have any
     tooth against me pluck it out for it will do you more hurt than
     all the teeth in your head will do you good' I answered coldly in
     these very words 'Mr Attorney I respect you I fear you not
     and the less you speak of your own greatness the more I will think
     of it'

     He replied 'I think scorn to stand upon terms of greatness
     towards you who are less than little less than the least' and
     other such strange light terms he gave me with that insulting
     which cannot be expressed

     Herewith stirred yet I said no more but this 'Mr Attorney do
     not depress me so far for I have been your better and may be
     again when it please the Queen'

     With this he spake neither I nor himself could tell what as if
     he had been born Attorney-General and in the end bade me not
     meddle with the Queen's business but with mine own and that I was
     unsworn etc I told him sworn or unsworn was all one to an honest
     man and that I ever set my service first and myself second and
     wished to God that he would do the like

     Then he said it were good to clap a cap ultegatum upon my
     back! To which I only said he could not and that he was at fault
     for he hunted upon an old scent He gave me a number of disgraceful
     words besides which I answered with silence and showing that I
     was not moved with them

The threat of the capias ultegatum was probably in reference to the
arrest of Bacon for debt in September      After this we are not
surprised at Bacon writing to Coke who take to yourself a liberty to
disgrace and disable my law my experience my discretion that since
I missed the Solicitor's place the rather I think by your means I
cannot expect that you and I shall ever serve as Attorney and Solicitor
together but either serve with another on your remove or step into
some other course And Coke no doubt took care that it should be so
Cecil too may possibly have thought that Bacon gave no proof of his
fitness for affairs in thus bringing before him a squabble in which both
parties lost their tempers

Bacon was not behind the rest of the world in the posting of men of
good quality towards the King in the rash which followed the Queen's
death of those who were eager to proffer their services to James for
whose peaceful accession Cecil had so skilfully prepared the way He
wrote to every one who he thought could help him to Cecil and to
Cecil's man I pray you as you find time let him know that he is the
personage in the State which I love most to Northumberland If I may
be of any use to your Lordship by my head tongue pen means or
friends I humbly pray you to hold me your own to the King's Scotch
friends and servants even to Southampton the friend of Essex who had
been shut up in the Tower since his condemnation with Essex and who was
now released This great change Bacon assured him hath wrought in
me no other change towards your Lordship than this that I may safely be
now that which I truly was before Bacon found in after years that
Southampton was not so easily conciliated But at present Bacon was
hopeful In mine own particular he writes I have many comforts and
assurances but in mine own opinion the chief is that the canvassing
world is gone and the deserving world is come He asks to be
recommended to the King I commend myself to your love and to the
well-using of my name as well in repressing and answering for me if
there be any biting or nibbling at it in that place as in impressing a
good conceit and opinion of me chiefly in the King as otherwise in
that Court His pen had been used under the government of the Queen
and he had offered a draft of a proclamation to the King's advisers But
though he obtained an interview with the King James's arrival in
England brought no immediate prospect of improvement in Bacon's
fortunes Indeed his name was at first inadvertently passed over in the
list of Queen's servants who were to retain their places The first
thing we hear of is his arrest a second time for debt and his letters
of thanks to Cecil who had rendered him assistance are written in deep
depression

     For my purpose or course I desire to meddle as little as I can in
     the King's causes his Majesty now abounding in counsel and to
     follow my private thrift and practice and to marry with some
     convenient advancement For as for any ambition I do assure your
     Honour mine is quenched In the Queen's my excellent Mistress's
     time the quorum was small her service was a kind of freehold
     and it was a more solemn time All those points agreed with my
     nature and judgment My ambition now I shall only put upon my pen
     whereby I shall be able to maintain memory and merit of the times
     succeeding

     Lastly for this divulged and almost prostituted title of
     knighthood I could without charge by your Honour's mean be
     content to have it both because of this late disgrace and because
     I have three new knights in my mess in Gray's Inn's commons and
     because I have found out an alderman's daughter an handsome
     maiden to my liking

Cecil however seems to have required that the money should be repaid
by the day and Bacon only makes a humble request which it might be
supposed could have been easily granted

     IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP In answer of your last
     letter your money shall be ready before your day principal
     interest and costs of suit So the sheriff promised when I
     released errors and a Jew takes no more The rest cannot be
     forgotten for I cannot forget your Lordship's dum memor ipse
     mei and if there have been aliquid nimis it shall be amended
     And to be plain with your Lordship that will quicken me now which
     slackened me before Then I thought you might have had more use of
     me than now I suppose you are like to have Not but I think the
     impediment will be rather in my mind than in the matter or times
     But to do you service I will come out of my religion at any time

     For my knighthood I wish the manner might be such as might grace
     me since the matter will not I mean that I might not be merely
     gregarious in a troop The coronation is at hand It may please
     your Lordship to let me hear from you speedily So I continue your
     Lordship's ever much bounden

     FR BACON
     From Gorhambury this   th of July     

But it was not done He obtained his title but not in a manner to
distinguish him He was knighted at Whitehall two days before the
coronation but had to share the honour with     others

It was not quite true that his ambition was quenched For the rest of
Cecil's life Cecil was the first man at James's Court and to the last
there was one thing that Bacon would not appear to believe he did not
choose to believe that it was Cecil who kept him back from employment
and honour To the last he persisted in assuming that Cecil was the
person who would help if he could a kinsman devoted to his interests
and profoundly conscious of his worth To the last he commended his
cause to Cecil in terms of unstinted affection and confiding hope It is
difficult to judge of the sincerity of such language The mere customary
language of compliment employed by every one at this time was of a kind
which to us sounds intolerable It seems as if nothing that ingenuity
could devise was too extravagant for an honest man to use and for a man
who respected himself to accept It must not indeed be forgotten that
conventionalities as well as insincerity differ in their forms in
different times and that insincerity may lurk behind frank and clear
words when they are the fashion as much as in what is like mere
fulsome adulation But words mean something in spite of forms and
fashions When a man of great genius writes his private letters we wish
generally to believe on the whole what he says and there are no limits
to the esteem the honour the confidence which Bacon continued to the
end to express towards Cecil Bacon appeared to trust him appeared in
spite of continued disappointments to rely on his good-will and good
offices But for one reason or another Bacon still remained in the
shade He was left to employ his time as he would and to work his way
by himself

He was not idle He prepared papers which he meant should come before
the King on the pressing subjects of the day The Hampton Court
conference between the Bishops and the Puritan leaders was at hand and
he drew up a moderating paper on the Pacification of the Church The
feeling against him for his conduct towards Essex had not died away and
he addressed to Lord Mountjoy that Apology concerning the Earl of
Essex so full of interest so skilfully and forcibly written so vivid
a picture of the Queen's ways with her servants which has every merit
except that of clearing Bacon from the charge of disloyalty to his best
friend The various questions arising out of the relations of the two
kingdoms now united under James were presenting themselves They were
not of easy solution and great mischief would follow if they were
solved wrongly Bacon turned his attention to them He addressed a
discourse to the King on the union of the two kingdoms the first of a
series of discussions on the subject which Bacon made peculiarly his
own and which no doubt first drew the King's attention and favour to
him

But for the first year of James's reign he was unnoticed by the King
and he was able to give his attention more freely to the great thought
and hope of his life This time of neglect gave him the opportunity of
leisurely calling together and examining the ideas which had long had
hold of his mind about the state of human knowledge about the
possibilities of extending it about the hopes and powers which that new
knowledge opened and about the methods of realising this great
prospect This the passion of his life never asleep even in the
hottest days of business or the most hopeless days of defeat must have
had full play during these days of suspended public employment He was a
man who was not easily satisfied with his attempts to arrange the order
and proportions of his plans for mastering that new world of unknown
truth which he held to be within the grasp of man if he would only dare
to seize it and he was much given to vary the shape of his work and to
try experiments in composition and even style He wrote and rewrote
Besides what was finally published there remains a larger quantity of
work which never reached the stage of publication He repeated over and
over again the same thoughts the same images and characteristic
sayings Among these papers is one which sums up his convictions about
the work before him and the vocation to which he had been called in
respect of it It is in the form of a Proem to a treatise on the
Interpretation of Nature It was never used in his published works
but as Mr Spedding says it has a peculiar value as an authentic
statement of what he looked upon as his special business in life It is
this mission which he states to himself in the following paper It is
drawn up in stately Latin Mr Spedding's translation is no unworthy
representation of the words of the great Prophet of Knowledge

     Believing that I was born for the service of mankind and
     regarding the care of the Commonwealth as a kind of common property
     which like the air and water belongs to everybody I set myself
     to consider in what way mankind might be best served and what
     service I was myself best fitted by nature to perform

     Now among all the benefits that could be conferred upon mankind I
     found none so great as the discovery of new arts endowments and
     commodities for the bettering of man's life But if a man could
     succeed not in striking out some particular invention however
     useful but in kindling a light in nature a light that should in
     its very rising touch and illuminate all the border regions that
     confine upon the circle of our present knowledge and so spreading
     further and further should presently disclose and bring into sight
     all that is most hidden and secret in the world that man I
     thought would be the benefactor indeed of the human race the
     propagator of man's empire over the universe the champion of
     liberty the conqueror and subduer of necessities

     For myself I found that I was fitted for nothing so well as for
     the study of Truth as having a mind nimble and versatile enough to
     catch the resemblances of things which is the chief point and at
     the same time steady enough to fix and distinguish their subtler
     differences as being gifted by nature with desire to seek
     patience to doubt fondness to meditate slowness to assert
     readiness to reconsider carefulness to dispose and set in order
     and as being a man that neither affects what is new nor admires
     what is old and that hates every kind of imposture So I thought
     my nature had a kind of familiarity and relationship with Truth

    Nevertheless because my birth and education had seasoned me in
    business of State and because opinions so young as I was would
    sometimes stagger me and because I thought that a man's own country
    has some special claims upon him more than the rest of the world
    and because I hoped that if I rose to any place of honour in the
    State I should have a larger command of industry and ability to
    help me in my work for these reasons I both applied myself to
    acquire the arts of civil life and commended my service so far as
    in modesty and honesty I might to the favour of such friends as had
    any influence In which also I had another motive for I felt that
    those things I have spoken of be they great or small reach no
    further than the condition and culture of this mortal life and I
    was not without hope the condition of religion being at that time
    not very prosperous that if I came to hold office in the State I
    might get something done too for the good of men's souls When I
    found however that my zeal was mistaken for ambition and my life
    had already readied the turning-point and my breaking health
    reminded me how ill I could afford to be so slow and I reflected
    moreover that in leaving undone the good that I could do by myself
    alone and applying myself to that which could not be done without
    the help and consent of others I was by no means discharging the
    duty that lay upon me I put all those thoughts aside and in
    pursuance of my old determination betook myself wholly to this
    work Nor am I discouraged from it because I see signs in the times
    of the decline and overthrow of that knowledge and erudition which
    is now in use Not that I apprehend any more barbarian invasions
    unless possibly the Spanish empire should recover its strength and
    having crushed other nations by arms should itself sink under its
    own weight but the civil wars which may be expected I think
    judging from certain fashions which have come in of late to
    spread through many countries together with the malignity of sects
    and those compendious artifices and devices which have crept into
    the place of solid erudition seem to portend for literature and the
    sciences a tempest not less fatal and one against which the
    Printing-office will be no effectual security And no doubt but that
    fair-weather learning which is nursed by leisure blossoms under
    reward and praise which cannot withstand the shock of opinion and
    is liable to be abused by tricks and quackery will sink under such
    impediments as these Far otherwise is it with that knowledge whose
    dignity is maintained by works of utility and power For the
    injuries therefore which should proceed from the times I am not
    afraid of them and for the injuries which proceed from men I am
    not concerned For if any one charge me with seeking to be wise
    over-much I answer simply that modesty and civil respect are fit
    for civil matters in contemplations nothing is to be respected but
    Truth If any one call on me for works and that presently I tell
    him frankly without any imposture at all that for me a man not
    old of weak health my hands full of civil business entering
    without guide or light upon an argument of all others the most
    obscure I hold it enough to have constructed the machine though I
    may not succeed in setting it on work If again any one ask me
    not indeed for actual works yet for definite premises and
    forecasts of the works that are to be I would have him know that
    the knowledge which we now possess will not teach a man even what to
    wish Lastly though this is a matter of less moment if any of
    our politicians who used to make their calculations and conjectures
    according to persons and precedents must needs interpose his
    judgment in a thing of this nature I would but remind him how
    according to the ancient fable the lame man keeping the course won
    the race of the swift man who left it and that there is no thought
    to be taken about precedents for the thing is without precedent

    For myself my heart is not set upon any of those things which
    depend upon external accidents I am not hunting for fame I have no
    desire to found a sect after the fashion of heresiarchs and to
    look for any private gain from such an undertaking as this I count
    both ridiculous and base Enough for me the consciousness of
    well-deserving and those real and effectual results with which
    Fortune itself cannot interfere

In      James's first Parliament met and with it Bacon returned to an
industrious public life which was not to be interrupted till it finally
came to an end with his strange and irretrievable fall The opportunity
had come and Bacon patient vigilant and conscious of great powers
and indefatigable energy fully aware of all the conditions of the time
pushed at once to the front in the House of Commons He lost no time in
showing that he meant to make himself felt The House of Commons had no
sooner met than it was involved in a contest with the Chancery with the
Lords and finally with the King himself about its privileges in this
case its exclusive right to judge of the returns of its members Bacon's
time was come for showing the King both that he was willing to do him
service and that he was worth being employed He took a leading part in
the discussions and was trusted by the House as their spokesman and
reporter in the various conferences The King in his overweening
confidence in his absolute prerogative had indeed got himself into
serious difficulty for the privilege was one which it was impossible
for the Commons to give up But Bacon led the House to agree to an
arrangement which saved their rights and under a cloud of words of
extravagant flattery he put the King in good-humour and elicited from
him the spontaneous proposal of a compromise which ended a very
dangerous dispute The King's voice said Bacon in his report to the
House was the voice of God in man the good spirit of God in the mouth
of man I do not say the voice of God and not of man I am not one of
Herod's flatterers a curse fell upon him that said it a curse on him
that suffered it We might say as was said to Solomon We are glad O
King that we give account to you because you discern what is spoken

The course of this Parliament in which Bacon was active and prominent
showed the King probably for the first time what Bacon was The
session was not so stormy as some of the later ones but occasions arose
which revealed to the King and to the House of Commons the deeply
discordant assumptions and purposes by which each party was influenced
and which brought out Bacon's powers of adjusting difficulties and
harmonising claims He never wavered in his loyalty to his own House
where it is clear that his authority was great But there was no limit
to the submission and reverence which he expressed to the King and
indeed to his desire to bring about what the King desired as far as it
could be safely done Dealing with the Commons his policy was to be
content with the substance and not to stand on the form Dealing with
the King he was forward to recognise all that James wanted recognised
of his kingcraft and his absolute sovereignty Bacon assailed with a
force and keenness which showed what he could do as an opponent the
amazing and intolerable grievances arising out of the survival of such
feudal customs as Wardship and Purveyance customs which made over a
man's eldest son and property during a minority to the keeping of the
King that is to a King's favourite and allowed the King's servants to
cut down a man's timber before the windows of his house But he urged
that these grievances should be taken away with the utmost tenderness
for the King's honour and the King's purse In the great and troublesome
questions relating to the Union he took care to be fully prepared He
was equally strong on points of certain and substantial importance
equally quick to suggest accommodations where nothing substantial was
touched His attitude was one of friendly and respectful independence
It was not misunderstood by the King Bacon who had hitherto been an
unsworn and unpaid member of the Learned Counsel now received his
office by patent with a small salary and he was charged with the grave
business of preparing the work for the Commissioners for the Union of
the Kingdoms in which when the Commission met he took a foremost and
successful part

But the Parliament before which their report was to be laid did not meet
till ten months after the work of the Commission was done Dec
     Nov      For nearly another year Bacon had no public work The
leisure was used for his own objects He was interested in history in a
degree only second to his interest in nature indeed but for the
engrossing claims of his philosophy of nature he might have been the
first and one of the greatest of our historians He addressed a letter
to the Chancellor Ellesmere on the deficiencies of British history and
on the opportunities which offered for supplying them He himself could
at present do nothing but because there be so many good painters both
for hand and colours it needeth but encouragement and instructions to
give life and light unto it But he mistook in this as in other
instances the way in which such things are done Men do not accomplish
such things to order but because their souls compel them as he himself
was building up his great philosophical structure in the midst of his
ambition and disappointment And this interval of quiet enabled him to
bring out his first public appeal on the subject which most filled his
mind He completed in English the Two Books of the Advancement of
Knowledge which were published at a book-shop at the gateway of Gray's
Inn in Holborn Oct      He intended that it should be published in
Latin also but he was dissatisfied with the ornate translation sent him
from Cambridge and probably he was in a hurry to get the book out It
was dedicated to the King not merely by way of compliment but with the
serious hope that his interest might be awakened in the subjects which
were nearest Bacon's heart Like other of Bacon's hopes it was
disappointed The King's studies and the King's humours were not of the
kind to make him care for Bacon's visions of the future or his eager
desire to begin at once a novel method of investigating the facts and
laws of nature and the appeal to him fell dead Bacon sent the book
about to his friends with explanatory letters To Sir T Bodley he
writes

     I think no man may more truly say with the Psalm Multum incola
     fuit anima mea Ps     than myself For I do confess since I was
     of any understanding my mind hath in effect been absent from that
     I have done and in absence are many errors which I willingly
     acknowledge and among them this great one which led the rest
     that knowing myself by inward calling to be fitter to hold a book
     than to play a part I have led my life in civil causes for which
     I was not very fit by nature and more unfit by the preoccupation
     of my mind Therefore calling myself home I have now enjoyed
     myself whereof likewise I desire to make the world partaker

To Lord Salisbury in a note of elaborate compliment he describes his
purpose by an image which he repeats more than once I shall content
myself to awake better spirits like a bell-ringer which is first up
to call others to church But the two friends whose judgment he
chiefly valued and who as on other occasions were taken into his most
intimate literary confidence were Bishop Andrewes his inquisitor
and Toby Matthews a son of the Archbishop of York who had become a
Roman Catholic and lived in Italy seeing a good deal of learned men
there apparently the most trusted of all Bacon's friends

When Parliament met again in November      the Gunpowder Plot and its
consequences filled all minds Bacon was not employed about it by
Government and his work in the House was confined to carrying on
matters left unfinished from the previous session On the rumour of
legal promotions and vacancies Bacon once more applied to Salisbury for
the Solicitorship March      But no changes were made and Bacon was
still next the door In May      he did what had for some time been
in his thoughts he married not the lady whom Essex had tried to win
for him that Lady Hatton who became the wife of his rival Coke but one
whom Salisbury helped him to gain an alderman's daughter Alice
Barnham an handsome maiden with some money and a disagreeable
mother by her second marriage Lady Packington Bacon's curious love of
pomp amused the gossips of the day Sir Francis Bacon writes Carleton
to Chamberlain was married yesterday to his young wench in Maribone
Chapel He was clad from top to toe in purple and hath made himself and
his wife such store of raiments of cloth of silver and gold that it
draws deep into her portion Of his married life we hear next to
nothing in his Essay on Marriage he is not enthusiastic in its
praise almost the only thing we know is that in his will twenty years
afterwards he showed his dissatisfaction with his wife who after his
death married again But it gave him an additional reason and an
additional plea for pressing for preferment and in the summer of     
the opening came Coke was made Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas
leaving the Attorney's place vacant A favourite of Salisbury's Hobart
became Attorney and Bacon hoped for some arrangement by which the
Solicitor Doddridge might be otherwise provided for and he himself
become Solicitor Hopeful as he was and patient of disappointments and
of what other men would have thought injustice and faithlessness he
felt keenly both the disgrace and the inconvenience of so often
expecting place and being so often passed over While the question was
pending he wrote to the King the Chancellor and Salisbury His letter
to the King is a record in his own words of his public services To the
Chancellor whom he believed to be his supporter he represented the
discredit which he suffered he was a common gaze and a speech the
little reputation which by his industry he gathered being scattered and
taken away by continual disgraces every new man coming above me and
his wife and his wife's friends were making him feel it The letters
show what Bacon thought to be his claims and how hard he found it to
get them recognised To the Chancellor he urged among other things
that time was slipping by 

     I humbly pray your Lordship to consider that time groweth precious
     with me and that a married man is seven years elder in his
     thoughts the first day And were it not to satisfy my wife's
     friends and to get myself out of being a common gaze and a speech
     I protest before God I would never speak word for it But to
     conclude as my honourable Lady your wife was some mean to make me
     to change the name of another so if it please you to help me to
     change my own name I can be but more and more bounden to you and
     I am much deceived if your Lordship find not the King well
     inclined and my Lord of Salisbury forward and affectionate

To Salisbury he writes

     I may say to your Lordship in the confidence of your poor
     kinsman and of a man by you advanced Tu idem fer opem qui spem
     dedisti for I am sure it was not possible for any living man to
     have received from another more significant and comfortable words
     of hope your Lordship being pleased to tell me during the course
     of my last service that you would raise me and that when you had
     resolved to raise a man you were more careful of him than himself
     and that what you had done for me in my marriage was a benefit to
     me but of no use to your Lordship And I know and all the
     world knoweth that your Lordship is no dealer of holy water but
     noble and real and on my part I am of a sure ground that I have
     committed nothing that may deserve alteration And therefore my
     hope is your Lordship will finish a good work and consider that
     time groweth precious with me and that I am now vergentibus
     annis And although I know your fortune is not to need an hundred
     such as I am yet I shall be ever ready to give you my best and
     first fruits and to supply as much as in me lieth worthiness by
     thankfulness

Still the powers were deaf to his appeals at any rate he had to be
content with another promise Considering the ability which he had shown
in Parliament the wisdom and zeal with which he had supported the
Government and the important position which he held in the House of
Commons the neglect of him is unintelligible except on two
suppositions that the Government that is Cecil were afraid of
anything but the mere routine of law as represented by such men as
Hobart and Doddridge or that Coke's hostility to him was unabated and
Coke still too important to be offended

Bacon returned to work when the Parliament met November      The
questions arising out of the Union the question of naturalisation its
grounds and limits the position of Scotchmen born before or since
the King's accession the Antenati and Postnati the question of a
union of laws with its consequences were discussed with great keenness
and much jealous feeling On the question of naturalisation Bacon took
the liberal and larger view The immediate union of laws he opposed as
premature He was a willing servant of the House and the House readily
made use of him He reported the result of conferences even when his
own opinion was adverse to that of the House And he reported the
speeches of such persons as Lord Salisbury probably throwing into them
both form and matter of his own At length silently on the   th of
June      he was appointed Solicitor-General He was then
forty-seven

It was also probably about this time writes Mr Spedding that Bacon
finally settled the plan of his 'Great Instauration' and began to
call it by that name




CHAPTER IV

BACON SOLICITOR-GENERAL


The great thinker and idealist the great seer of a world of knowledge
to which the men of his own generation were blind and which they could
not even with his help imagine a possible one had now won the first
step in that long and toilsome ascent to success in life in which for
fourteen years he had been baffled He had made himself for good and
for evil a servant of the Government of James I He was prepared to
discharge with zeal and care all his duties He was prepared to perform
all the services which that Government might claim from its servants He
had sought he had passionately pressed to be admitted within that
circle in which the will of the King was the supreme law after that it
would have been ruin to have withdrawn or resisted But it does not
appear that the thought or wish to resist or withdraw ever presented
itself he had thoroughly convinced himself that in doing what the King
required he was doing the part of a good citizen and a faithful servant
of the State and Commonwealth The two lives the two currents of
purpose and effort were still there Behind all the wrangle of the
courts and the devising of questionable legal subtleties to support some
unconstitutional encroachment or to outflank the defence of some
obnoxious prisoner the high philosophical meditations still went on
the remembrance of their sweetness and grandeur wrung more than once
from the jaded lawyer or the baffled counsellor the complaint in words
which had a great charm for him Multum incola fuit anima mea My
soul hath long dwelt where it would not be But opinion and ambition
and the immense convenience of being great and rich and powerful and
the supposed necessities of his condition were too strong even for his
longings to be the interpreter and the servant of nature There is no
trace of the faintest reluctance on his part to be the willing minister
of a court of which not only the principal figure but the arbiter and
governing spirit was to be George Villiers Duke of Buckingham

The first leisure that Bacon had after he was appointed Solicitor he
used in a characteristic way He sat down to make a minute stock-taking
of his position and its circumstances In the summer of      he devoted
a week of July to this survey of his life its objects and its
appliances and he jotted down day by day through the week from his
present reflections or he transcribed from former note-books a series
of notes in loose order mostly very rough and not always intelligible
about everything that could now concern him This curious and intimate
record which he called Commentarius Solutus was discovered by Mr
Spedding who not unnaturally had some misgivings about publishing so
secret and so ambiguous a record of a man's most private confidences
with himself But there it was and as it was known he no doubt
decided wisely in publishing it as it stands he has done his best to
make it intelligible and he has also done his best to remove any
unfavourable impressions that might arise from it It is singularly
interesting as an evidence of Bacon's way of working of his
watchfulness his industry his care in preparing himself long
beforehand for possible occasions his readiness to take any amount of
trouble about his present duties his self-reliant desire for more
important and difficult ones It exhibits his habit of self-observation
and self-correction his care to mend his natural defects of voice
manner and delivery it is even more curious in showing him watching
his own physical constitution and health in the most minute details of
symptoms and remedies equally with a scientific and a practical object
It contains his estimate of his income his expenditure his debts
schedules of lands and jewels his rules for the economy of his estate
his plans for his new gardens and terraces and ponds and buildings at
Gorhambury He was now a rich man valuing his property at £      and
his income at £     burdened with a considerable debt but not more
than he might easily look to wipe out But besides all these points
there appear the two large interests of his life the reform of
philosophy and his ideal of a great national policy The greatness of
Britain was one of his favourite subjects of meditation He puts down
in his notes the outline of what should be aimed at to secure and
increase it it is to make the various forces of the great and growing
empire work together in harmonious order without waste without
jealousy without encroachment and collision to unite not only the
interests but the sympathies and aims of the Crown with those of the
people and Parliament and so to make Britain now in peril from nothing
but from the strength of its own discordant elements that Monarchy of
the West in reality which Spain was in show and as Bacon always
maintained only in show The survey of the condition of his
philosophical enterprise takes more space He notes the stages and
points to which his plans have reached he indicates with a favourite
quotation or apophthegm Plus ultra ausus vana
contemnere aditus non nisi sub persona infantis soon to be
familiar to the world in his published writings the lines of argument
sometimes alternative ones which were before him he draws out schemes
of inquiry specimen tables distinctions and classifications about the
subject of Motion in English interlarded with Latin or in Latin
interlarded with English of his characteristic and practical sort he
notes the various sources from which he might look for help and
co-operation of learned men beyond the seas to begin first in
France to print it laying for a place to command wits and pens he
has his eye on rich and childless bishops on the enforced idleness of
State prisoners in the Tower like Northumberland and Raleigh on the
great schools and universities where he might perhaps get hold of some
college for Inventors as we should say for the endowment of
research These matters fill up a large space of his notes But his
thoughts were also busy about his own advancement And to these sheets
of miscellaneous memoranda Bacon confided not only his occupations and
his philosophical and political ideas but with a curious innocent
unreserve the arts and methods which he proposed to use in order to win
the favour of the great and to pull down the reputation of his rivals
He puts down in detail how he is to recommend himself to the King and
the King's favourites 

     To set on foot and maintain access with his Majesty Dean of the
     Chapel May Murray Keeping a course of access at the beginning of
     every term and vacation with a memorial To attend some time his
     repasts or to fall into a course of familiar discourse To find
     means to win a conceit not open but private of being
     affectionate and assured to the Scotch and fit to succeed
     Salisbury in his manage in that kind Lord Dunbar Duke of Lennox
     and Daubiny secret

Then again of Salisbury 

     Insinuate myself to become privy to my Lord of Salisbury's
     estate To correspond with Salisbury in a habit of natural but no
     ways perilous boldness and in vivacity invention care to cast
     and enterprise but with due caution for this manner I judge both
     in his nature freeth the stands and in his ends pleaseth him best
     and promiseth more use of me I judge my standing out and not
     favoured by Northampton must needs do me good with Salisbury
     especially comparative to the Attorney

The Attorney Hobart filled the place to which Bacon had so long aspired
and which he thought perhaps reasonably that he could fill much
better At any rate one of the points to which he recurs frequently in
his notes is to exhort himself to make his own service a continual
contrast to the Attorney's to have in mind and use the Attorney's
weakness enumerating a list of instances Too full of cases and
distinctions Nibbling solemnly he distinguisheth but apprehends not
No gift with his pen in proclamations and the like and at last he
draws out in a series of epigrams his view of Hubbard's
disadvantages 

     Better at shift than at drift Subtilitas sine acrimonia
     No power with the judge He will alter a thing but not mend
     He puts into patents and deeds words not of law but of common sense
     and discourse Sociable save in profit He doth depopulate
     mine office otherwise called inclose I never knew any one of
     so good a speech with a worse pen 

Then in a marginal note Solemn goose Stately leastwise nodd 
crafty They have made him believe that he is wondrous wise And
finally he draws up a paper of counsels and rules for his own
conduct Custumæ aptæ ad Individuum which might supply an outline
for an essay on the arts of behaviour proper for a rising official a
sequel to the biting irony of the essays on Cunning and Wisdom for a
Man's Self

     To furnish my L of S with ornaments for public speeches To make
     him think how he should be reverenced by a Lord Chancellor if I
     were Princelike

     To prepare him for matters to be handled in Council or before the
     King aforehand and to show him and yield him the fruits of my
     care

     To take notes in tables when I attend the Council and sometimes
     to move out of a memorial shewed and seen To have particular
     occasions fit and graceful and continual to maintain private
     speech with every the great persons and sometimes drawing more
     than one together Ex imitatione Att This specially in public
     places and without care or affectation At Council table to make
     good my L of Salisb motions and speeches and for the rest
     sometimes one sometimes another chiefly his that is most earnest
     and in affection

     To suppress at once my speaking with panting and labour of breath
     and voice Not to fall upon the main too sudden but to induce and
     intermingle speech of good fashion To use at once upon entrance
     given of speech though abrupt to compose and draw in myself To
     free myself at once from payt  of formality and compliment
     though with some show of carelessness pride and rudeness

     And then follows a long list of matters of business to be attended
     to

These arts of a court were not new it was not new for men to observe
them in their neighbours and rivals What was new was the writing them
down with deliberate candour among a man's private memoranda as
things to be done and with the intention of practising them This of
itself it has been suggested shows that they were unfamiliar and
uncongenial to Bacon for a man reminds himself of what he is apt to
forget But a man reminds himself also of what seems to him at the
moment most important and what he lays most stress upon And it is
clear that these are the rules rhetorical and ethical which Bacon laid
down for himself in pursuing the second great object of his life his
official advancement and that whatever we think of them they were the
means which he deliberately approved

As long as Salisbury lived the distrust which had kept Bacon so long in
the shade kept him at a distance from the King's ear and from influence
on his counsels Salisbury was the one Englishman in whom the King had
become accustomed to confide in his own conscious strangeness to
English ways and real dislike and suspicion of them Salisbury had an
authority which no one else had both from his relations with James at
the end of Elizabeth's reign and as the representative of her policy
and the depositary of its traditions and if he had lived things might
not perhaps have been better in James's government but many things
probably would have been different But while Salisbury was supreme
Bacon though very alert and zealous was mainly busied with his
official work and the Solicitor's place had become as he says a mean
thing compared with the Attorney's and also an extremely laborious
place one of the painfullest places in the kingdom Much of it was
routine but responsible and fatiguing routine But if he was not in
Salisbury's confidence he was prominent in the House of Commons The
great and pressing subject of the time was the increasing difficulties
of the revenue created partly by the inevitable changes of a growing
state but much more by the King's incorrigible wastefulness It was
impossible to realise completely the great dream and longing of the
Stuart kings and their ministers to make the Crown independent of
parliamentary supplies but to dispense with these supplies as much as
possible and to make as much as possible of the revenue permanent was
the continued and fatal policy of the Court The Great Contract a
scheme by which in return for the surrender by the Crown of certain
burdensome and dangerous claims of the Prerogative the Commons were to
assure a large compensating yearly income to the Crown was Salisbury's
favourite device during the last two years of his life It was not a
prosperous one The bargain was an ill-imagined and not very decorous
transaction between the King and his people Both parties were naturally
jealous of one another suspicious of underhand dealing and tacit
changes of terms prompt to resent and take offence and not easy to
pacify when they thought advantage had been taken and Salisbury either
by his own fault or by yielding to the King's canny shiftiness gave
the business a more haggling and huckstering look than it need have had
Bacon a subordinate of the Government but a very important person in
the Commons did his part loyally as it seems and skilfully in
smoothing differences and keeping awkward questions from making their
appearance Thus he tried to stave off the risk of bringing definitely
to a point the King's cherished claim to levy impositions or custom
duties on merchandise by virtue of his prerogative a claim which he
warned the Commons not to dispute and which Bacon maintaining it as
legal in theory did his best to prevent them from discussing and to
persuade them to be content with restraining Whatever he thought of the
Great Contract he did what was expected of him in trying to gain for
it fair play But he made time for other things also He advised and
advised soundly on the plantation and finance of Ireland It was a
subject in which he took deep interest A few years later with only
too sure a foresight he gave the warning lest Ireland civil become
more dangerous to us than Ireland savage He advised not soundly in
point of law but curiously in accordance with modern notions about
endowments though in this instance in the famous will case of Thomas
Sutton the founder of the Charter House his argument probably covered
the scheme of a monstrous job in favour of the needy Court And his own
work went on in spite of the pressure of the Solicitor's place To the
first years of his official life belong three very interesting
fragments intended to find a provisional place in the plan of the
Great Instauration To his friend Toby Matthews at Florence he sent
in manuscript the great attack on the old teachers of knowledge which
is perhaps the most brilliant and also the most insolently unjust and
unthinking piece of rhetoric ever composed by him the Redargutio
Philosophiarum

     I send you at this time the only part which hath any harshness
     and yet I framed to myself an opinion that whosoever allowed well
     of that preface which you so much commend will not dislike or at
     least ought not to dislike this other speech of preparation for
     it is written out of the same spirit and out of the same
     necessity Nay it doth more fully lay open that the question
     between me and the ancients is not of the virtue of the race but
     of the rightness of the way And to speak truth it is to the other
     but as palma to pugnus part of the same thing more large
     Myself am like the miller of Huntingdon that was wont to pray for
     peace amongst the willows for while the winds blew the wind-mills
     wrought and the water-mill was less customed So I see that
     controversies of religion must hinder the advancement of sciences
     Let me conclude with my perpetual wish towards yourself that the
     approbation of yourself by your own discreet and temperate
     carriage may restore you to your country and your friends to your
     society And so I commend you to God's goodness

     Gray's Inn this   th of October     

To Bishop Andrewes he sent also in manuscript another piece
belonging to the same plan the deeply impressive treatise called Visa
et Cogitata what Francis Bacon had seen of nature and knowledge and
what he had come by meditation to think of what he had seen The letter
is not less interesting than the last in respect to the writer's
purposes his manner of writing and his relations to his correspondent

     MY VERY GOOD LORD Now your Lordship hath been so long in the
     church and the palace disputing between kings and popes methinks
     you should take pleasure to look into the field and refresh your
     mind with some matter of philosophy though that science be now
     through age waxed a child again and left to boys and young men
     and because you were wont to make me believe you took liking to my
     writings I send you some of this vacation's fruits and thus much
     more of my mind and purpose I hasten not to publish perishing I
     would prevent And I am forced to respect as well my times as the
     matter For with me it is thus and I think with all men in my
     case if I bind myself to an argument it loadeth my mind but if I
     rid my mind of the present cogitation it is rather a recreation
     This hath put me into these miscellanies which I purpose to
     suppress if God give me leave to write a just and perfect volume
     of philosophy which I go on with though slowly I send not your
     Lordship too much lest it may glut you Now let me tell you what
     my desire is If your Lordship be so good now as when you were the
     good Dean of Westminster my request to you is that not by pricks
     but by notes you would mark unto me whatsoever shall seem unto you
     either not current in the style or harsh to credit and opinion or
     inconvenient for the person of the writer for no man can be judge
     and party and when our minds judge by reflection of ourselves
     they are more subject to error And though for the matter itself my
     judgement be in some things fixed and not accessible by any man's
     judgement that goeth not my way yet even in those things the
     admonition of a friend may make me express myself diversly I would
     have come to your Lordship but that I am hastening to my house in
     the country And so I commend your Lordship to God's goodness

There was yet another production of this time of which we have a
notice from himself in a letter to Toby Matthews the curious and
ingenious little treatise on the Wisdom of the Ancients one of the
most popular of his works says Mr Spedding in his own and in the
next generation but of value to us mainly for its quaint poetical
colour and the unexpected turns like answers to a riddle given to the
ancient fables When this work was published it was the third time that
he had appeared as an author in print He thus writes about it and
himself

     MR MATTHEWS I do heartily thank you for your letter of the   th
     of August from Salamanca and in recompense thereof I send you a
     little work of mine that hath begun to pass the world They tell me
     my Latin is turned into silver and become current Had you been
     here you should have been my inquisitor before it came forth but
     I think the greatest inquisitor in Spain will allow it My great
     work goeth forward and after my manner I alter ever when I add
     So that nothing is finished till all be finished

     From Gray's Inn the   th of February     

In the autumn of      the Attorney-General was ill and Bacon reminded
both the King and Salisbury of his claim He was afraid he writes to
the King with an odd forgetfulness of the persistency and earnestness
of his applications that by reason of my slowness to sue and
apprehend occasions upon the sudden keeping one plain course of painful
service I may in fine dierum be in danger to be neglected and
forgotten The Attorney recovered but Bacon on New Year's Tide of
       wrote to Salisbury to thank him for his good-will It is the
last letter of Bacon's to Salisbury which has come down to us

     IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP I would entreat the new year to
     answer for the old in my humble thanks to your Lordship both for
     many your favours and chiefly that upon the occasion of Mr
     Attorney's infirmity I found your Lordship even as I would wish
     This doth increase a desire in me to express my thankful mind to
     your Lordship hoping that though I find age and decays grow upon
     me yet I may have a flash or two of spirit left to do you service
     And I do protest before God without compliment or any light vein
     of mind that if I knew in what course of life to do you best
     service I would take it and make my thoughts which now fly to
     many pieces be reduced to that center But all this is no more
     than I am which is not much but yet the entire of him that is 

In the following May May         Salisbury died From this date James
passed from government by a minister who whatever may have been his
faults was laborious public-spirited and a statesman into his own
keeping and into the hands of favourites who cared only for themselves
With Cecil ceased the traditions of the days of Elizabeth and Burghley
in many ways evil and cruel traditions but not ignoble and sordid ones
and James was left without the stay and also without the check which
Cecil's power had been to him The field was open for new men and new
ways the fashions and ideas of the time had altered during the last ten
years and those of the Queen's days had gone out of date Would the new
turn out for the better or the worse Bacon at any rate saw the
significance of the change and the critical eventfulness of the moment
It was his habit of old to send memorials of advice to the heads of the
Government apparently without such suggestions seeming more intrusive
or officious than a leading article seems now and perhaps with much the
same effect It was now a time to do so if ever and he was in an
official relation to the King which entitled him to proffer advice He
at once prepared to lay his thoughts before the King and to suggest
that he could do far better service than Cecil and was ready to take
his place The policy of the Great Contract had certainly broken
down and the King under Cecil's guidance had certainly not known how
to manage an English parliament In writing to the King he found it hard
to satisfy himself Several draft letters remain and it is not certain
which of them if any was sent But immediately on Salisbury's death he
began May   th a letter in which he said that he had never yet been
able to show his affection to the King having been as a hawk tied to
another's fist and if as was said to one that spake great words
Amice verba tua desiderant civitatem your Majesty say to me Bacon
your words require a place to speak them yet that place or not
place was with the King But the draft breaks off abruptly and with
the date of the   st we have the following

     Your Majesty hath lost a great subject and a great servant But if
     I should praise him in propriety I should say that he was a fit
     man to keep things from growing worse but no very fit man to
     reduce things to be much better For he loved to have the eyes of
     all Israel a little too much upon himself and to have all business
     still under the hammer and like clay in the hands of the potter
     to mould it as he thought good so that he was more in operatione
     than in opere And though he had fine passages of action yet the
     real conclusions came slowly on So that although your Majesty hath
     grave counsellors and worthy persons left yet you do as it were
     turn a leaf wherein if your Majesty shall give a frame and
     constitution to matters before you place the persons in my simple
     opinion it were not amiss But the great matter and most instant
     for the present is the consideration of a Parliament for two
     effects the one for the supply of your estate the other for the
     better knitting of the hearts of your subjects unto your Majesty
     according to your infinite merit for both which Parliaments have
     been and are the antient and honourable remedy

     Now because I take myself to have a little skill in that region
     as one that ever affected that your Majesty mought in all your
     causes not only prevail but prevail with satisfaction of the inner
     man and though no man can say but I was a perfect and peremptory
     royalist yet every man makes me believe that I was never one hour
     out of credit with the Lower House my desire is to know whether
     your Majesty will give me leave to meditate and propound unto you
     some preparative remembrances touching the future Parliament

Whether he sent this or not he prepared another draft What had
happened in the mean while we know not but Bacon was in a bitter mood
and the letter reveals for the first time what was really in Bacon's
heart about the great subject and great servant of whom he had just
written so respectfully and with whom he had been so closely connected
for most of his life The fierceness which had been gathering for years
of neglect and hindrance under that placid and patient exterior broke
out He offered himself as Cecil's successor in business of State He
gave his reason for being hopeful of success Cecil's bitterest enemy
could not have given it more bitterly

     My principal end being to do your Majesty service I crave leave
     to make at this time to your Majesty this most humble oblation of
     myself I may truly say with the psalm Multum incola fuit anima
     mea for my life hath been conversant in things wherein I take
     little pleasure Your Majesty may have heard somewhat that my
     father was an honest man and somewhat you may have seen of myself
     though not to make any true judgement by because I have hitherto
     had only potestatem verborum nor that neither I was three of my
     young years bred with an ambassador in France and since I have
     been an old truant in the school-house of your council-chamber
     though on the second form yet longer than any that now sitteth
     hath been upon the head form If your Majesty find any aptness in
     me or if you find any scarcity in others whereby you may think it
     fit for your service to remove me to business of State although I
     have a fair way before me for profit and by your Majesty's grace
     and favour for honour and advancement and in a course less
     exposed to the blasts of fortune yet now that he is gone quo
     vivente virtutibus certissimum exitium I will be ready as a
     chessman to be wherever your Majesty's royal hand shall set me
     Your Majesty will bear me witness I have not suddenly opened
     myself thus far I have looked upon others I see the exceptions
     I see the distractions and I fear Tacitus will be a prophet
     magis alii homines quam alii mores I know mine own heart and I
     know not whether God that hath touched my heart with the affection
     may not touch your royal heart to discern it Howsoever I shall at
     least go on honestly in mine ordinary course and supply the rest
     in prayers for you remaining etc

This is no hasty outburst In a later paper on the true way of
retrieving the disorders of the King's finances full of large and wise
counsel after advising the King not to be impatient and assuring him
that a state of debt is not so intolerable for it is no new thing for
the greatest Kings to be in debt and all the great men of the Court
had been in debt without any manner of diminution of their
greatness he returns to the charge in detail against Salisbury and the
Great Contract

     My second prayer is that your Majesty in respect to the hasty
     freeing of your state would not descend to any means or degree of
     means which carrieth not a symmetry with your Majesty and
     greatness He is gone from whom those courses did wholly flow To
     have your wants and necessities in particular as it were hanged up
     in two tablets before the eyes of your lords and commons to be
     talked of for four months together To have all your courses to
     help yourself in revenue or profit put into printed books which
     were wont to be held arcana imperii To have such worms of
     aldermen to lend for ten in the hundred upon good assurance and
     with such entreaty  as if it should save the bark of your
     fortune To contract still where mought be had the readiest
     payment and not the best bargain To stir a number of projects for
     your profit and then to blast them and leave your Majesty nothing
     but the scandal of them To pretend even carriage between your
     Majesty's rights and ease of the people and to satisfy neither
     These courses and others the like I hope are gone with the deviser
     of them which have turned your Majesty to inestimable prejudice

And what he thought of saying but on further consideration struck out
was the following It is no wonder that he struck it out but it shows
what he felt towards Cecil

    I protest to God though I be not superstitious when I saw your
    M's book against Vorstius and Arminius and noted your zeal to
    deliver the majesty of God from the vain and indign comprehensions
    of heresy and degenerate philosophy as you had by your pen formerly
    endeavoured to deliver kings from the usurpation of Rome perculsit
    illico animum that God would set shortly upon you some visible
    favour and let me not live if I thought not of the taking away of
    that man

And from this time onwards he scarcely ever mentions Cecil's name in his
correspondence with James but with words of condemnation which imply
that Cecil's mischievous policy was the result of private ends Yet this
was the man to whom he had written the New Year's Tide letter six
months before a letter which is but an echo to the last of all that he
had been accustomed to write to Cecil when asking assistance or offering
congratulation Cecil had indeed little claim on Bacon's gratitude he
had spoken him fair in public and no doubt in secret distrusted and
thwarted him But to the last Bacon did not choose to acknowledge this
Had James disclosed something of his dead servant who left some strange
secrets behind him which showed his unsuspected hostility to Bacon
Except on this supposition but there is nothing to support it no
exaggeration of the liberty allowed to the language of compliment is
enough to clear Bacon of an insincerity which is almost inconceivable in
any but the meanest tools of power

I assure myself wrote Bacon to the King your Majesty taketh not me
for one of a busy nature for my estate being free from all
difficulties and I having such a large field for contemplation as I
have partly and shall much more make manifest unto your Majesty and the
world to occupy my thoughts nothing could make me active but love and
affection So Bacon described his position with questionable
accuracy for his estate was not free from difficulties in the new
time coming He was still kept out of the inner circle of the Council
but from the moment of Salisbury's death he became a much more important
person He still sued for advancement and still met with
disappointment the mean men still rose above him The lucrative place
of Master of the Wards was vacated by Salisbury's death Bacon was
talked of for it and probably expected it for he drew up new rules for
it and a speech for the new master but the office and the speech went
to Sir George Carey Soon after Sir George Carey died Bacon then
applied for it through the new favourite Rochester He was so
confident of the place that he put most of his men into new cloaks and
the world of the day amused itself at his disappointment when the place
was given to another mean man Sir Walter Cope of whom the gossips
wrote that if the last two Treasurers could look out of their graves to
see those successors in that place they would be out of countenance
with themselves and say to the world quantum mutatus But Bacon's
hand and counsel appear more and more in important matters the
improvement of the revenue the defence of extreme rights of the
prerogative in the case against Whitelocke the great question of
calling a parliament and of the true and princely way of dealing with
it His confidential advice to the King about calling a parliament was
marked by his keen perception of the facts of the situation it was
marked too by his confident reliance on skilful indirect methods and
trust in the look of things it bears traces also of his bitter feeling
against Salisbury whom he charges with treacherously fomenting the
opposition of the last Parliament There was no want of worldly wisdom
in it certainly it was more adapted to James's ideas of state-craft
than the simpler plan of Sir Henry Nevill that the King should throw
himself frankly on the loyalty and good-will of Parliament And thus he
came to be on easy terms with James who was quite capable of
understanding Bacon's resource and nimbleness of wit In the autumn of
     the Chief-Justiceship of the King's Bench became vacant Bacon at
once gave the King reasons for sending Coke from the Common Pleas where
he was a check on the prerogative to the King's Bench where he could
do less harm while Hobart went to the Common Pleas The promotion was
obvious but the Common Pleas suited Coke better and the place was more
lucrative Bacon's advice was followed Coke very reluctantly knowing
well who had given it and why not only weeping himself but followed
by the tears of all the Court of Common Pleas moved up to the higher
post The Attorney Hobart succeeded and Bacon at last became Attorney
October         In Chamberlain's gossip we have an indication such
as occurs only accidentally of the view of outsiders There is a
strong apprehension that little good is to be expected by this change
and that Bacon may prove a dangerous instrument




CHAPTER V

BACON ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND CHANCELLOR


Thus at last at the age of fifty-two Bacon had gained the place which
Essex had tried to get for him at thirty-two The time of waiting had
been a weary one and it is impossible not to see that it had been
hurtful to Bacon A strong and able man very eager to have a field for
his strength and ability who is kept out of it as he thinks unfairly
and is driven to an attitude of suppliant dependency in pressing his
claim on great persons who amuse him with words can hardly help
suffering in the humiliating process It does a man no good to learn to
beg and to have a long training in the art And further this long
delay kept up the distraction of his mind between the noble work on
which his soul was bent and the necessities of that civil or
professional and political life by which he had to maintain his estate
All the time that he was canvassing it is his own word for office
and giving up his time and thoughts to the work which it involved the
great Instauration had to wait his hours of leisure and his
exclamation so often repeated Multum incola fuit anima mea bears
witness to the longings that haunted him in his hours of legal drudgery
or in the service of his not very thankful employers Not but that he
found compensation in the interest of public questions in the company
of the great in the excitement of state-craft and state employment in
the pomp and enjoyment of court life He found too much compensation it
was one of his misfortunes But his heart was always sound in its
allegiance to knowledge and if he had been fortunate enough to have
risen earlier to the greatness which he aimed at as a vantage-ground for
his true work or if he had had self-control to have dispensed with
wealth and position if he had escaped the long necessity of being a
persistent and still baffled suitor we might have had as a completed
whole what we have now only in great fragments and we should have been
spared the blots which mar a career which ought to have been a noble
one

The first important matter that happened after Bacon's new appointment
was the Essex divorce case and the marriage of Lady Essex with the
favourite whom Cecil's death had left at the height of power and who
from Lord Rochester was now made Earl of Somerset With the divorce the
beginning of the scandals and tragedies of James's reign Bacon had
nothing to do At the marriage which followed Bacon presented as his
offering a masque performed by the members of Gray's Inn of which he
bore the charges and which cost him the enormous sum of £     Whether
it were to repay his obligations to the Howards or in lieu of a fee
to Rochester who levied toll on all favours from the King it can
hardly be said as has been suggested to be a protest against the great
abuse of the times the sale of offices for money The very splendid
trifle the Masque of Flowers was one form of the many extravagant
tributes paid but too willingly to high-handed worthlessness of which
the deeper and darker guilt was to fill all faces with shame two years
afterwards

As Attorney Bacon had to take a much more prominent part in affairs
legal criminal constitutional administrative than he had yet been
allowed to have We know that it was his great object to show how much
more active and useful an Attorney he could be than either Coke or
Hobart and as far as unflagging energy and high ability could make a
good public servant he fully carried out his purpose In Parliament
the addled Parliament of      in which he sat for the University of
Cambridge he did his best to reconcile what were fast becoming
irreconcilable the claims and prerogatives of an absolute king
irritable suspicious exacting prodigal with the ancient rights and
liberties growing stronger in their demands by being denied resisted
or outwitted of the popular element in the State In the trials which
are so large and disagreeable a part of the history of these
years trials arising out of violent words provoked by the violent acts
of power one of which Peacham's became famous because in the course
of it torture was resorted to or trials which witnessed to the
corruption of the high society of the day like the astounding series of
arraignments and condemnations following on the discoveries relating to
Overbury's murder which had happened just before the Somerset
marriage Bacon had to make the best that he could for the cruel and
often unequal policy of the Court and Bacon must take his share in the
responsibility for it An effort on James's part to stop duelling
brought from Bacon a worthier piece of service in the shape of an
earnest and elaborate argument against it full of good sense and good
feeling but hopelessly in advance of the time On the many questions
which touched the prerogative James found in his Attorney a ready and
skilful advocate of his claims who knew no limit to them but in the
consideration of what was safe and prudent to assert He was a better
and more statesmanlike counsellor in his unceasing endeavours to
reconcile James to the expediency of establishing solid and good
relations with his Parliament and in his advice as to the wise and
hopeful ways of dealing with it Bacon had no sympathy with popular
wants and claims of popularity of all that was called popular he had
the deepest suspicion and dislike the opinions and the judgment of
average men he despised as a thinker a politician and a courtier the
malignity of the people he thought great I do not love he says
the word people But he had a high idea of what was worthy of a
king and was due to the public interests and he saw the folly of the
petty acts and haughty words the use of which James could not resist
In his new office he once more urged on and urged in vain his
favourite project for revising simplifying and codifying the law This
was a project which would find little favour with Coke and the crowd of
lawyers who venerated him men whom Bacon viewed with mingled contempt
and apprehension both in the courts and in Parliament where they were
numerous and whom he more than once advised the King to bridle and keep
in awe Bacon presented his scheme to the King in a Proposition or
as we should call it a Report It is very able and interesting marked
with his characteristic comprehensiveness and sense of practical needs
and with a confidence in his own knowledge of law which contrasts
curiously with the current opinion about it He speaks with the utmost
honour of Coke's work but he is not afraid of a comparison with him I
do assure your Majesty he says I am in good hope that when Sir
Edward Coke's Reports and my Rules and Decisions shall come to
posterity there will be whatever is now thought question who was the
greater lawyer But the project though it was entertained and
discussed in Parliament came to nothing No one really cared about it
except Bacon

But in these years      and      two things happened of the utmost
consequence to him One was the rise more extravagant than anything
that England had seen for centuries and in the end more fatal of the
new favourite who from plain George Villiers became the all-powerful
Duke of Buckingham Bacon like the rest of the world saw the necessity
of bowing before him and Bacon persuaded himself that Villiers was
pre-eminently endowed with all the gifts and virtues which a man in his
place would need We have a series of his letters to Villiers they are
of course in the complimentary vein which was expected but if their
language is only compliment there is no language left for expressing
what a man wishes to be taken for truth The other matter was the
humiliation by Bacon's means and in his presence of his old rival
Coke In the dispute about jurisdiction always slumbering and lately
awakened and aggravated by Coke between the Common Law Courts and the
Chancery Coke had threatened the Chancery with Præmunire The King's
jealousy took alarm and the Chief-Justice was called before the
Council There a decree based on Bacon's advice and probably drawn up
by him peremptorily overruled the legal doctrine maintained by the
greatest and most self-confident judge whom the English courts had seen
The Chief-Justice had to acquiesce in this reading of the law and then
as if such an affront were not enough Coke was suspended from his
office and further enjoined to review and amend his published
reports where they were inconsistent with the view of law which on
Bacon's authority the Star Chamber had adopted June      This he
affected to do but the corrections were manifestly only colourable
his explanations of his legal heresies against the prerogative as these
heresies were formulated by the Chancellor and Bacon and presented to
him for recantation were judged insufficient and in a decree prefaced
by reasons drawn up by Bacon in which besides Coke's errors of law
his deceit contempt and slander of the Government his perpetual
turbulent carriage and his affectation of popularity were noted he
was removed from his office Nov      So for the present the old
rivalry had ended in a triumph for Bacon Bacon whom Coke had so long
headed in the race whom he had sneered at as a superficial pretender to
law and whose accomplishments and enthusiasm for knowledge he utterly
despised had not only defeated him but driven him from his seat with
dishonour When we remember what Coke was what he had thought of Bacon
and how he prized his own unique reputation as a representative of
English law the effects of such a disgrace on a man of his temper
cannot easily be exaggerated

But for the present Bacon had broken through the spell which had so long
kept him back He won a great deal of the King's confidence and the
King was more and more ready to make use of him though by no means
equally willing to think that Bacon knew better than himself Bacon's
view of the law and his resources of argument and expression to make it
good could be depended upon in the keen struggle to secure and enlarge
the prerogative which was now beginning In the prerogative both James
and Bacon saw the safety of the State and the only reasonable hope of
good government but in Bacon's larger and more elevated views of
policy of a policy worthy of a great king and a king of England James
was not likely to take much interest The memorials which it was
Bacon's habit to present on public affairs were wasted on one who had so
little to learn from others so he thought and so all assured him about
the secrets of empire Still they were proofs of Bacon's ready mind and
James even when he disagreed with Bacon's opinion and arguments was
too clever not to see their difference from the work of other men Bacon
rose in favour and from the first he was on the best of terms with
Villiers He professed to Villiers the most sincere devotion According
to his custom he presented him with a letter of wise advice on the
duties and behaviour of a favourite He at once began and kept up with
him to the end a confidential correspondence on matters of public
importance He made it clear that he depended upon Villiers for his own
personal prospects and it had now become the most natural thing that
Bacon should look forward to succeeding the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere
who was fast failing Bacon had already Feb           in terms
which seem strange to us but were less strange then set forth in a
letter to the King the reasons why he should be Chancellor criticising
justly enough only that he was a party interested the qualifications
of other possible candidates Coke Hobart and the Archbishop Abbott
Coke would be an overruling nature in an overruling place and
popular men were no sure mounters for your Majesty's saddle Hobart
was incompetent As to Abbott the Chancellor's place required a whole
man and to have both jurisdiction spiritual and temporal was fit
only for a king The promise that Bacon should have the place came to
him three days afterwards through Villiers He acknowledged it in a
burst of gratitude Feb           I will now wholly rely on your
excellent and happy self I am yours surer to you than my own life
For as they speak of the Turquoise stone in a ring I will break into
twenty pieces before you bear the least fall They were unconsciously
prophetic words But Ellesmere lasted longer than was expected It was
not till a year after this promise that he resigned On the  th of
March        Bacon received the seals He expresses his obligations
to Villiers now Lord Buckingham in the following letter

     MY DEAREST LORD It is both in cares and kindness that small ones
     float up to the tongue and great ones sink down into the heart
     with silence Therefore I could speak little to your Lordship
     to-day neither had I fit time but I must profess thus much that
     in this day's work you are the truest and perfectest mirror and
     example of firm and generous friendship that ever was in court And
     I shall count every day lost wherein I shall not either study your
     well-doing in thought or do your name honour in speech or perform
     you service in deed Good my Lord account and accept me your most
     bounden and devoted friend and servant of all men living

     March        ie         
     FR BACON CS

He himself believed the appointment to be a popular one I know I am
come in he writes to the King soon after with as strong an envy of
some particulars as with the love of the general On the  th of May
     he took his seat in Chancery with unusual pomp and magnificence
and set forth in an opening speech with all his dignity and force the
duties of his great office and his sense of their obligation But there
was a curious hesitation in treating him as other men were treated in
like cases He was only Lord Keeper It was not till the following
January        that he received the office of Lord Chancellor It was
not till half a year afterwards that he was made a Peer Then he became
Baron Verulam July      and in January        Viscount St
Alban's

From this time Bacon must be thought of first and foremost as a Judge
in the great seat which he had so earnestly sought It was the place not
merely of law which often tied the judge's hands painfully but of true
justice when law failed to give it Bacon's ideas of the duties of a
judge were clear and strong as he showed in various admirable speeches
and charges his duties as regards his own conduct and reputation his
duties in keeping his subordinates free from the taint of corruption He
was not ignorant of the subtle and unacknowledged ways in which unlawful
gains may be covered by custom and an abuse goes on because men will
not choose to look at it He entered on his office with the full purpose
of doing its work better than it had ever been done He saw where it
wanted reforming and set himself at once to reform The accumulation
and delay of suits had become grievous at once he threw his whole
energy into the task of wiping out the arrears which the bad health of
his predecessor and the traditional sluggishness of the court had heaped
up In exactly three months from his appointment he was able to report
that these arrears had been cleared off This day June        he
writes to Buckingham I have made even with the business of the kingdom
for common justice Not one cause unheard The lawyers drawn dry of all
the motions they were to make Not one petition unheard And this I
think could not be said in our time before

The performance was splendid and there is no reason to think that the
work so rapidly done was not well done We are assured that Bacon's
decisions were unquestioned and were not complained of At the same
time before this allegation is accepted as conclusive proof of the
public satisfaction it must be remembered that the question of his
administration of justice which was at last to assume such strange
proportions has never been so thoroughly sifted as to enable us to
pronounce upon it it should be The natural tendency of Bacon's mind
would undoubtedly be to judge rightly and justly but the negative
argument of the silence at the time of complainants in days when it was
so dangerous to question authority and when we have so little evidence
of what men said at their firesides is not enough to show that he never
failed

But the serious thing is that Bacon subjected himself to two of the most
dangerous influences which can act on the mind of a judge the influence
of the most powerful and most formidable man in England and the
influence of presents in money and other gifts From first to last he
allowed Buckingham whom no man as Bacon soon found could displease
except at his own peril to write letters to him on behalf of suitors
whose causes were before him and he allowed suitors not often while
the cause was pending but sometimes even then to send him directly or
through his servants large sums of money Both these things are
explained It would have been characteristic of Bacon to be confident
that he could defy temptation these habits were the fashion of the
time and everybody took them for granted Buckingham never asked his
good offices beyond what Bacon thought just and right and asked them
rather for the sake of expedition than to influence his judgment And as
to the money presents every office was underpaid this was the common
way of acknowledging pains and trouble it was analogous to a doctor's
or a lawyer's fee now And there is no proof that either influence ever
led Bacon to do wrong This has been said and said with some degree of
force But if it shows that Bacon was not in this matter below his age
it shows that he was not above it No one knew better than Bacon that
there were no more certain dangers to honesty and justice than the
interference and solicitation of the great and the old famous pest of
bribes of which all histories and laws were full And yet on the
highest seat of justice in the realm he the great reformer of its
abuses allowed them to make their customary haunt He did not mean to
do wrong his conscience was clear he had not given thought to the
mischief they must do sooner or later to all concerned with the Court
of Chancery With a magnificent carelessness he could afford to run
safely a course closely bordering on crime in which meaner men would
sin and be ruined

Before six months were over Bacon found on what terms he must stand with
Buckingham By a strange fatality quite unintentionally he became
dragged into the thick of the scandalous and grotesque dissensions of
the Coke family The Court was away from London in the North and Coke
had been trying not without hope of success to recover the King's
favour Coke was a rich man and Lady Compton the mother of the
Villiers thought that Coke's daughter would be a good match for one of
her younger sons It was really a great chance for Coke but he haggled
about the portion and the opportunity which might perhaps have led to
his taking Bacon's place passed But he found himself in trouble in
other ways his friends especially Secretary Winwood contrived to
bring the matter on again and he consented to the Villiers's terms But
his wife the young lady's mother Lady Hatton would not hear of it
and a furious quarrel followed She carried off her daughter into the
country Coke with a warrant from Secretary Winwood which Bacon had
refused to give him pursued her with his son 'Fighting Clem' and
ten or eleven servants weaponed in a violent manner he repaired to
the house where she was remaining and with a piece of timber or form
broke open the door and dragged her along to his coach Lady Hatton
rushed off the same afternoon for help to Bacon

     After an overturn by the way at last to my Lord Keeper's they
     come but could not have instant access to him for that his people
     told them he was laid at rest being not well Then my La Hatton
     desired she might be in the next room where my Lord lay that she
     might be the first that should speak with him after he was
     stirring The door-keeper fulfilled her desire and in the meantime
     gave her a chair to rest herself in and there left her alone but
     not long after she rose up and bounced against my Lord Keeper's
     door and waked him and affrighted him that he called his men to
     him and they opening the door she thrust in with them and
     desired his Lp to pardon her boldness but she was like a cow that
     had lost her calf and so justified herself and pacified my
     Lord's anger and got his warrant and my Lo Treasurer's warrant
     and others of the Council to fetch her daughter from the father and
     bring them both to the Council

It was a chance that the late Chief-Justice and his wife with their
armed parties did not meet on the road in which case there were like
to be strange tragedies At length the Council compelled both sides to
keep the peace and the young lady was taken for the present out of the
hands of her raging parents Bacon had assumed that the affair was the
result of an intrigue between Winwood and Coke and that the Court would
take part against Coke a man so deep in disgrace and so outrageously
violent Supposing that he had the ear of Buckingham he wrote
earnestly persuading him to put an end to the business and in the
meantime the Council ordered Coke to be brought before the Star Chamber
for riot and force to be heard and sentenced as justice shall
appertain They had not the slightest doubt that they were doing what
would please the King A few days after they met and then they learned
the truth

     Coke and his friends writes Chamberlain complain of hard
     measure from some of the greatest at that board and that he was
     too much trampled upon with ill language And our friend ie
     Winwood passed out scot free for the warrant which the greatest
     word illegible there said was subject to a præmunire and
     withal told the Lady Compton that they wished well to her and her
     sons and would be ready to serve the Earl of Buckingham with all
     true affection whereas others did it out of faction and
     ambition which words glancing directly at our good friend
     Winwood he was driven to make his apology and to show how it
     was put upon him from time to time by the Queen and other parties
     and for conclusion showed a letter of approbation of all his
     courses from the King making the whole table judge what faction
     and ambition appeared in this carriage Ad quod non fuit
     responsum

None indeed but blank faces and thoughts of what might come next The
Council and Bacon foremost had made a desperate mistake It is
evident as Mr Spedding says that he had not divined Buckingham's
feelings on the subject He was now to learn them To his utter
amazement and alarm he found that the King was strong for the match and
that the proceeding of the Council was condemned at Court as gross
misconduct In vain he protested that he was quite willing to forward
the match that in fact he had helped it Bacon's explanations and his
warnings against Coke the King rejected with some disdain he
justified Coke's action he charged Bacon with disrespect and
ingratitude to Buckingham he put aside his arguments and apologies as
worthless or insincere Such reprimands had not often been addressed
even to inferior servants Bacon's letters to Buckingham remained at
first without notice when Buckingham answered he did so with scornful
and menacing curtness Meanwhile Bacon heard from Yelverton how things
were going at Court

     Sir E Coke he wrote hath not forborne by any engine to heave
     at both your Honour and myself and he works the weightiest
     instrument the Earl of Buckingham who as I see sets him as
     close to him as his shirt the Earl speaking in Sir Edward's
     phrase and as it were menacing in his spirit

Buckingham he went on to say did nobly and plainly tell me he would
not secretly bite but whosoever had had any interest or tasted of the
opposition to his brother's marriage he would as openly oppose them to
their faces and they should discern what favour he had by the power he
would use The Court like a pack of dogs had set upon Bacon It is
too common in every man's mouth in Court that your greatness shall be
abated and as your tongue hath been as a razor unto some so shall
theirs be to you Buckingham said to every one that Bacon had been
forgetful of his kindness and unfaithful to him not forbearing in open
speech to tax you as if it were an inveterate custom with you to be
unfaithful unto him as you were to the Earls of Essex and Somerset

All this while Bacon had been clearly in the right He had thrust
himself into no business that did not concern him He had not as
Buckingham accuses him of having done overtroubled himself with the
marriage He had done his simple duty as a friend as a councillor as a
judge He had been honestly zealous for the Villiers's honour and
warned Buckingham of things that were beyond question He had curbed
Coke's scandalous violence perhaps with no great regret but with
manifest reason But for this he was now on the very edge of losing his
office it was clear to him as it is clear to us that nothing could
save him but absolute submission He accepted the condition How this
submission was made and received and with what gratitude he found that
he was forgiven may be seen in the two following letters Buckingham
thus extends his grace to the Lord Keeper and exhorts him to better
behaviour

     But his Majesty's direction in answer of your letter hath given me
     occasion to join hereunto a discovery unto you of mine inward
     thoughts proceeding upon the discourse you had with me this day
     For I do freely confess that your offer of submission unto me and
     in writing if so I would have it battered so the unkindness that
     I had conceived in my heart for your behaviour towards me in my
     absence as out of the sparks of my old affection towards you I
     went to sound his Majesty's intention how he means to behave
     himself towards you specially in any public meeting where I found
     on the one part his Majesty so little satisfied with your late
     answer unto him which he counted for I protest I use his own
     terms confused and childish and his vigorous resolution on the
     other part so fixed that he would put some public exemplary mark
     upon you as I protest the sight of his deep-conceived indignation
     quenched my passion making me upon the instant change from the
     person of a party into a peace-maker so as I was forced upon my
     knees to beg of his Majesty that he would put no public act of
     disgrace upon you and as I dare say no other person would have
     been patiently heard in this suit by his Majesty but myself so did
     I though not without difficulty obtain thus much that he would
     not so far disable you from the merit of your future service as to
     put any particular mark of disgrace upon your person Only thus far
     his Majesty protesteth that upon the conscience of his office he
     cannot omit though laying aside all passion to give a kingly
     reprimand at his first sitting in council to so many of his
     councillors as were then here behind and were actors in this
     business for their ill behaviour in it Some of the particular
     errors committed in this business he will name but without
     accusing any particular persons by name

     Thus your Lordship seeth the fruits of my natural inclination and
     I protest all this time past it was no small grief unto me to hear
     the mouth of so many upon this occasion open to load you with
     innumerable malicious and detracting speeches as if no music were
     more pleasing to my ears than to rail of you which made me rather
     regret the ill nature of mankind that like dogs love to set upon
     him that they see once snatched at And to conclude my Lord you
     have hereby a fair occasion so to make good hereafter your
     reputation by your sincere service to his Majesty as also by your
     firm and constant kindness to your friends as I may your
     Lordship's old friend participate of the comfort and honour that
     will thereby come to you Thus I rest at last

     MY EVER BEST LORD now better than yourself Your Lordship's pen
     or rather pencil hath pourtrayed towards me such magnanimity and
     nobleness and true kindness as methinketh I see the image of some
     ancient virtue and not anything of these times It is the line of
     my life and not the lines of my letter that must express my
     thankfulness wherein if I fail then God fail me and make me as
     miserable as I think myself at this time happy by this reviver

     FR BACON CS

Thus he had tried his strength with Buckingham He had found that this
a little parent-like manner of advising him and the doctrine that a
true friend ought rather to go against his mind than his good was not
what Buckingham expected from him And he never ventured on it again It
is not too much to say that a man who could write as he now did to
Buckingham could not trust himself in any matter in which Buckingham
was interested

But the reconciliation was complete and Bacon took his place more and
more as one of the chief persons in the Government James claimed so
much to have his own way and had so little scruple in putting aside in
his superior wisdom sometimes very curtly Bacon's or any other
person's recommendations that though his services were great and were
not unrecognised he never had the power and influence in affairs to
which his boundless devotion to the Crown his grasp of business and
his willing industry ought to have entitled him He was still a
servant and made to feel it though a servant in the first form It
was James and Buckingham who determined the policy of the country or
settled the course to be taken in particular transactions when this was
settled it was Bacon's business to carry it through successfully In
this he was like all the other servants of the Crown and like them he
was satisfied with giving his advice whether it were taken or not but
unlike many of them he was zealous in executing with the utmost vigour
and skill the instructions which were given him Thus he was required to
find the legal means for punishing Raleigh and as a matter of duty he
found them He was required to tell the Government side of the story of
Raleigh's crimes and punishment which really was one side of the story
only not by any means the whole and he told it as he had told the
Government story against Essex with force moderation and good sense
Himself he never would have made James's miserable blunders about
Raleigh but the blunders being made it was his business to do his best
to help the King out of them When Suffolk the Lord Treasurer was
disgraced and brought before the Star Chamber for corruption and
embezzlement in his office Bacon thought that he was doing no more than
his duty in keeping Buckingham informed day by day how the trial was
going on how he had taken care that Suffolk's submission should not
stop it for all would be but a play on the stage if justice went not
on in the right course how he had taken care that the evidence went
well I will not say I sometime holp it as far as was fit for a
judge how a little to warm the business  I spake a word that
he that did draw or milk treasure from Ireland did not emulgere
milk money but blood This and other little things like it while
he was sitting as a judge to try if the word may be used a personal
enemy of Buckingham however bad the case might be against Suffolk
sound strange indeed to us and not less so when in reporting the
sentence and the various opinions of the Council about it he for once
praises Coke for the extravagance of his severity Sir Edward Coke did
his part I have not heard him do better and began with a fine of
£       but the judges first and most of the rest reduced it to
£      I do not dislike that thing passed moderately and all things
considered it is not amiss and might easily have been worse

In all this which would have been perfectly natural from an
Attorney-General of the time Bacon saw but his duty even as a judge
between the Crown and the subject It was what was expected of those
whom the King chose to employ and whom Buckingham chose to favour But
a worse and more cruel case illustrating the system which a man like
Bacon could think reasonable and honourable was the disgrace and
punishment of Yelverton the Attorney-General the man who had stood by
Bacon and in his defence had faced Buckingham knowing well
Buckingham's dislike of himself when all the Court turned against Bacon
in his quarrel with Coke and Lady Compton Towards the end of the year
     on the eve of a probable meeting of Parliament there was great
questioning about what was to be done about certain patents and
monopolies monopolies for making gold and silk thread and for
licensing inns and ale-houses which were in the hands of Buckingham's
brothers and their agents The monopolies were very unpopular there was
always doubt as to their legality they were enforced oppressively and
vexatiously by men like Michell and Mompesson who acted for the
Villiers and the profits of them went for the most part not into the
Exchequer but into the pockets of the hangers-on of Buckingham Bacon
defended them both in law and policy and his defence is thought by Mr
Gardiner to be not without grounds but he saw the danger of obstinacy
in maintaining what had become so hateful in the country and strongly
recommended that the more indefensible and unpopular patents should be
spontaneously given up the more so as they were of no great fruit
But Buckingham's insolent perversity refused to be convinced The
Council when the question was before them decided to maintain them
Bacon who had rightly voted in the minority thus explains his own vote
to Buckingham The King did wisely put it upon and consult whether the
patents were at this time to be removed by Act of Council before
Parliament I opined but yet somewhat like Ovid's mistress that
strove but yet as one that would be overcome that yes! But in the
various disputes which had arisen about them Yelverton had shown that
he very much disliked the business of defending monopolies and sending
London citizens to jail for infringing them He did it but he did it
grudgingly It was a great offence in a man whom Buckingham had always
disliked and it is impossible to doubt that what followed was the
consequence of his displeasure

     In drawing up a new charter for the city of London writes Mr
     Gardiner Yelverton inserted clauses for which he was unable to
     produce a warrant The worst that could be said was that he had
     through inadvertence misunderstood the verbal directions of the
     King Although no imputation of corruption was brought against
     him yet he was suspended from his office and prosecuted in the
     Star Chamber He was then sentenced to dismissal from his post to
     a fine of £     and to imprisonment during the Royal pleasure

In the management of this business Bacon had the chief part Yelverton
on his suspension at once submitted The obnoxious clauses are not said
to have been of serious importance but they were new clauses which the
King had not sanctioned and it would be a bad precedent to pass over
such unauthorised additions even by an Attorney-General I mistook many
things said Yelverton afterwards in words which come back into our
minds at a later period I was improvident in some things and too
credulous in all things It might have seemed that dismissal if not a
severe reprimand was punishment enough But the submission was not
enough in Bacon's opinion for the King's honour He dwelt on the
greatness of the offence and the necessity of making a severe example
According to his advice Yelverton was prosecuted in the Star Chamber
It was not merely a mistake of judgment Herein said Bacon I note
the wisdom of the law of England which termeth the highest contempt and
excesses of authority Misprisions which if you take the sound and
derivation of the word is but mistaken but if you take the use and
acception of the word it is high and heinous contempt and usurpation of
authority whereof the reason I take to be and the name excellently
imposed for that main mistaking it is ever joined with contempt for
he that reveres will not easily mistake but he that slights and thinks
more of the greatness of his place than of the duty of his place will
soon commit misprisions The day would come when this doctrine would be
pressed with ruinous effect against Bacon himself But now he expounded
with admirable clearness the wrongness of carelessness about warrants
and of taking things for granted He acquitted his former colleague of
corruption of reward but in truth that makes the offence rather
divers than less for some offences are black and others scarlet
some sordid some presumptuous He pronounced his sentence the fine
the imprisonment for his place I declare him unfit for it And the
next day says Mr Spedding he reported to Buckingham the result of
the proceeding and takes no small credit for his own part in it

It was thus that the Court used Bacon and that Bacon submitted to be
used He could have done if he had been listened to much nobler
service He had from the first seen and urged as far as he could the
paramount necessity of retrenchment in the King's profligate
expenditure Even Buckingham had come to feel the necessity of it at
last and now that Bacon filled a seat at the Council and that the
prosecution of Suffolk and an inquiry into the abuses of the Navy had
forced on those in power the urgency of economy there was a chance of
something being done to bring order into the confusion of the finances
Retrenchment began at the King's kitchen and the tables of his servants
an effort was made not unsuccessfully to extend it wider under the
direction of Lionel Cranfield a self-made man of business from the
city but with such a Court the task was an impossible one It was not
Bacon's fault though he sadly mismanaged his own private affairs that
the King's expenditure was not managed soberly and wisely Nor was it
Bacon's fault as far as advice went that James was always trying
either to evade or to outwit a Parliament which he could not like the
Tudors overawe Bacon's uniform counsel had been Look on a Parliament
as a certain necessity but not only as a necessity as also a unique
and most precious means for uniting the Crown with the nation and
proving to the world outside how Englishmen love and honour their King
and their King trusts his subjects Deal with it frankly and nobly as
becomes a king not suspiciously like a huckster in a bargain Do not be
afraid of Parliament Be skilful in calling it but don't attempt to
pack it Use all due adroitness and knowledge of human nature and
necessary firmness and majesty in managing it keep unruly and
mischievous people in their place but do not be too anxious to
meddle let nature work and above all though of course you want
money from it do not let that appear as the chief or real cause of
calling it Take the lead in legislation Be ready with some interesting
or imposing points of reform or policy about which you ask your
Parliament to take counsel with you Take care to frame and have ready
some commonwealth bills that may add respect to the King's government
and acknowledgment of his care not wooing bills to make the King and
his graces cheap but good matter to set the Parliament on work that an
empty stomach do not feed on humour So from the first had Bacon always
thought so he thought when he watched as a spectator James's blunders
with his first Parliament of      so had he earnestly counselled James
when admitted to his confidence as to the Parliaments of      and     
so again but in vain as Chancellor he advised him to meet the
Parliament of      It was wise and from his point of view honest
advice though there runs all through it too much reliance on
appearances which were not all that they seemed there was too much
thought of throwing dust in the eyes of troublesome and inconvenient
people But whatever motives there might have been behind it would have
been well if James had learned from Bacon how to deal with Englishmen
But he could not I wonder said James one day to Gondomar that my
ancestors should ever have permitted such an institution as the House of
Commons to have come into existence I am a stranger and found it here
when I arrived so that I am obliged to put up with what I cannot get
rid of James was the only one of our many foreign kings who to the
last struggled to avoid submitting himself to the conditions of an
English throne




CHAPTER VI

BACON'S FALL


When Parliament met on January           and Bacon as Lord
Chancellor set forth in his ceremonial speeches to the King and to the
Speaker the glories and blessings of James's reign no man in England
had more reason to think himself fortunate He had reached the age of
sixty and had gained the object of his ambition More than that he was
conscious that in his great office he was finding full play for his
powers and his high public purposes He had won greatly on the
confidence of the King He had just received a fresh mark of honour from
him a few days before he had been raised a step in the peerage and he
was now Viscount St Alban's With Buckingham he seemed to be on terms
of the most affectionate familiarity exchanging opinions freely with
him on every subject And Parliament met in good-humour They voted
money at once One of the matters which interested Bacon most the
revision of the Statute Book they took up as one of their first
measures and appointed a Select Committee to report upon it And what
amid the apparent felicity of the time was of even greater personal
happiness to Bacon the first step of the Great Instauration had been
taken During the previous autumn Oct         the Novum Organum
the first instalment of his vast design was published the result of
the work of thirty years and copies were distributed to great people
among others to Coke He apprehended no evil he had nothing to fear
and much to hope from the times

His sudden and unexpected fall so astonishing and so irreparably
complete is one of the strangest events of that still imperfectly
comprehended time There had been and were still to be plenty of
instances of the downfall of power as ruinous and even more tragic
though scarcely any one more pathetic in its surprise and its shame But
it is hard to find one of which so little warning was given and the
causes of which are at once in part so clear and in part so obscure and
unintelligible Such disasters had to be reckoned upon as possible
chances by any one who ventured into public life Montaigne advises that
the discipline of pain should be part of every boy's education for the
reason that every one in his day might be called upon to undergo the
torture And so every public man in the England of the Tudors and
Stuarts entered on his career with the perfectly familiar expectation
of possibly closing it it might be in an honourable and ceremonious
fashion in the Tower and on the scaffold just as he had to look
forward to the possibility of closing it by small-pox or the plague So
that when disaster came though it might be unexpected as death is
unexpected it was a turn of things which ought not to take a man by
surprise But some premonitory signs usually gave warning There was
nothing to warn Bacon that the work which he believed he was doing so
well would be interrupted

We look in vain for any threatenings of the storm What the men of his
time thought and felt about Bacon it is not easy to ascertain
Appearances are faint and contradictory he himself though scornful of
judges who sought to be popular believed that he came in with the
favour of the general that he had a little popular reputation which
followeth me whether I will or no No one for years had discharged the
duties of his office with greater efficiency Scarcely a trace remains
of any suspicion previous to the attack upon him of the justice of his
decisions no instance was alleged that in fact impure motives had
controlled the strength and lucidity of an intellect which loved to be
true and right for the mere pleasure of being so Nor was there anything
in Bacon's political position to make him specially obnoxious above all
others of the King's Council He maintained the highest doctrines of
prerogative but they were current doctrines both at the Council board
and on the bench and they were not discredited nor extinguished by his
fall To be on good terms with James and Buckingham meant a degree of
subservience which shocks us now but it did not shock people then and
he did not differ from his fellows in regarding it as part of his duty
as a public servant of the Crown No doubt he had enemies some with old
grudges like Southampton who had been condemned with Essex some like
Suffolk smarting under recent reprimands and the biting edge of Bacon's
tongue some like Coke hating him from constitutional antipathies and
the strong antagonism of professional doctrines for a long course of
rivalry and for mortifying defeats But there is no appearance of
preconcerted efforts among them to bring about his overthrow He did not
at the time seem to be identified with anything dangerous or odious
There was no doubt a good deal of dissatisfaction with Chancery among
the common lawyers because it interfered with their business in the
public partly from the traditions of its slowness partly from its
expensiveness partly because being intended for special redress of
legal hardship it was sure to disappoint one party to a suit But Bacon
thought that he had reformed Chancery He had also done a great deal to
bring some kind of order or at least hopefulness of order into the
King's desperate finances And he had never set himself against
Parliament On the contrary he had always been forward to declare that
the King could not do without Parliament and that Parliament only
needed to be dealt with generously and as became a King to be not a
danger and hindrance to the Crown but its most sincere and trustworthy
support

What was then to portend danger to Bacon when the Parliament of       
met The House of Commons at its meeting was thoroughly loyal and
respectful it meant to be benedictum et pacificum parliamentum Every
one knew that there would be grievances which would not be welcome to
the Court but they did not seem likely to touch him Every one knew
that there would be questions raised about unpopular patents and
oppressive monopolies and about their legality and it was pretty well
agreed upon at Court that they should be given up as soon as complained
of But Bacon was not implicated more than the Crown lawyers before him
in what all the Crown lawyers had always defended There was
dissatisfaction about the King's extravagance and wastefulness about
his indecision in the cause of the Elector Palatine about his supposed
intrigues with Papistical and tyrannical Spain but Bacon had nothing to
do with all this except as far as he could to give wise counsel and
warning The person who made the King despised and hated was the
splendid and insolent favourite Buckingham It might have been thought
that the one thing to be set against much that was wrong in the State
was the just and enlightened and speedy administration of equity in the
Chancery

When Parliament met though nothing seemed to threaten mischief it met
with a sturdy purpose of bringing to account certain delinquents whose
arrogance and vexations of the subjects had provoked the country and
who were supposed to shelter themselves under the countenance of
Buckingham Michell and Mompesson were rascals whose misdemeanors might
well try the patience of a less spirited body than an English House of
Commons Buckingham could not protect them and hardly tried to do so
But just as one electric current induces another by neighbourhood so
all this deep indignation against Buckingham's creatures created a
fierce temper of suspicion about corruption all through the public
service Two Committees were early appointed by the House of Commons
one a Committee on Grievances such as the monopolies the other a
Committee to inquire into abuses in the Courts of Justice and receive
petitions about them In the course of the proceedings the question
arose in the House as to the authorities or referees who had certified
to the legality of the Crown patents or grants which had been so grossly
abused and among these referees were the Lord Chancellor and other
high officers both legal and political

It was the little cloud But lookers-on like Chamberlain did not think
much of it The referees he wrote on Feb   th who certified the
legality of the patents are glanced at but they are chiefly above the
reach of the House they attempt so much that they will accomplish
little Coke who was now the chief leader in Parliament began to talk
ominously of precedents and to lay down rules about the power of the
House to punish rules which were afterwards found to have no authority
for them Cranfield the representative of severe economy insisted that
the honour of the King required that the referees whoever they were
should be called to account The gathering clouds shifted a little when
the sense of the House seemed to incline to giving up all retrospective
action and to a limitation for the future by statute of the
questionable prerogative a limitation which was in fact attempted by a
bill thrown out by the Lords But they gathered again when the Commons
determined to bring the whole matter before the House of Lords The King
wrote to warn Bacon of what was coming The proposed conference was
staved off by management for a day or two but it could not be averted
and the Lords showed their eagerness for it And two things by this
time the beginning of March seemed now to have become clear first
that under the general attack on the referees was intended a blow
against Bacon next that the person whom he had most reason to fear was
Sir Edward Coke

The storm was growing but Bacon was still unalarmed though Buckingham
had been frightened into throwing the blame on the referees

     I do hear he writes to Buckingham dating his letter on March
      th the day I received the seal from divers of judgement
     that to-morrow's conference is like to pass in a calm as to the
     referees Sir Lionel Cranfield who hath been formerly the trumpet
     said yesterday that he did now incline unto Sir John Walter's
     opinion and motion not to have the referees meddled with otherwise
     than to discount it from the King and so not to look back but to
     the future And I do hear almost all men of judgement in the House
     wish now that way I woo nobody I do but listen and I have doubt
     only of Sir Edward Coke who I wish had some round caveat given
     him from the King for your Lordship hath no great power with him
     But a word from the King mates him

But Coke's opportunity had come The House of Commons was disposed for
gentler measures But he was able to make it listen to his harsher
counsels and from this time his hand appears in all that was done The
first conference was a tame and dull one The spokesmen had been slack
in their disagreeable and perhaps dangerous duty But Coke and his
friends took them sharply to task The heart and tongue of Sir Edward
Coke are true relations said one of his fervent supporters but his
pains hath not reaped that harvest of praise that he hath deserved For
the referees they are as transcendent delinquents as any other and
sure their souls made a wilful elopement from their bodies when they
made these certificates A second conference was held with the Lords
and this time the charge was driven home The referees were named the
Chancellor at the head of them When Bacon rose to explain and justify
his acts he was sharply stopped and reminded that he was transgressing
the orders of the House in speaking till the Committees were named to
examine the matter What was even more important the King had come to
the House of Lords March   th and frightened perhaps about his
subsidies told them that he was not guilty of those grievances which
are now discovered but that he grounded his judgement upon others who
have misled him The referees would be attacked people thought if the
Lower House had courage

All this was serious As things were drifting it seemed as if Bacon
might have to fight the legal question of the prerogative in the form of
a criminal charge and be called upon to answer the accusation of being
the minister of a crown which legal language pronounced absolute and of
a King who interpreted legal language to the letter and further to
meet his accusers after the King himself had disavowed what his servant
had done What passed between Bacon and the King is confused and
uncertain but after his speech the King could scarcely have thought of
interfering with the inquiry The proceedings went on Committees were
named for the several points of inquiry and Bacon took part in these
arrangements It was a dangerous position to have to defend himself
against an angry House of Commons led and animated by Coke and
Cranfield But though the storm had rapidly thickened the charges
against the referees were not against him alone His mistake in law if
it was a mistake was shared by some of the first lawyers and first
councillors in England There was a battle before him but not a
hopeless one Modicæ fidei quare dubitasti he writes about this
time to an anxious friend

But in truth the thickening storm had been gathering over his head
alone It was against him that the whole attack was directed as soon as
it took a different shape the complaints against the other referees
such as the Chief-Justice who was now Lord Treasurer though some
attempt was made to press them were quietly dropped What was the
secret history of these weeks we do not know But the result of Bacon's
ruin was that Buckingham was saved As they speak of the Turquoise
stone in a ring Bacon had said to Buckingham when he was made
Chancellor I will break into twenty pieces before you have the least
fall Without knowing what he pledged himself to he was taken at his
word

At length the lightning fell During the early part of March while
these dangerous questions were mooted about the referees a Committee
appointed early in the session had also been sitting on abuses in
courts of justice and as part of their business an inquiry had been
going on into the ways of the subordinate officers of the Court of
Chancery Bacon had early Feb   th sent a message to the Committee
courting full inquiry willingly consenting that any man might speak
anything of his Court On the   th of March the chairman Sir R
Philips reported that he had in his hands divers petitions many
frivolous and clamorous many of weight and consequence Cranfield who
presided over the Court of Wards had quarrelled fiercely with the
Chancery where he said there was neither Law Equity nor Conscience
and pressed the inquiry partly it may be to screen his own Court
which was found fault with by the lawyers Some scandalous abuses were
brought to light in the Chancery They showed that Bacon was at fault
in the art of government and did not know how to keep his servants in
order One of them John Churchill an infamous forger of Chancery
orders finding things going hard with him and resolved it is said
not to sink alone offered his confessions of all that was going on
wrong in the Court But on the   th of March things took another turn
It was no longer a matter of doubtful constitutional law no longer a
question of slack discipline over his officers To the astonishment if
not of the men of his own day at least to the unexhausted astonishment
of times following a charge was suddenly reported from the Committee to
the Commons against the Lord Chancellor not of straining the
prerogative or of conniving at his servants' misdoings but of being
himself a corrupt and venal judge Two suitors charged him with
receiving bribes Bacon was beginning to feel worried and anxious and
he wrote thus to Buckingham At length he had begun to see the meaning
of all these inquiries and to what they were driving

     MY VERY GOOD LORD Your Lordship spake of Purgatory I am now in
     it but my mind is in a calm for my fortune is not my felicity I
     know I have clean hands and a clean heart and I hope a clean house
     for friends or servants But Job himself or whosoever was the
     justest judge by such hunting for matters against him as hath been
     used against me may for a time seem foul specially in a time when
     greatness is the mark and accusation is the game And if this be to
     be a Chancellor I think if the great seal lay upon Hounslow Heath
     nobody would take it up But the King and your Lordship will I
     hope put an end to these miseries one way or other And in troth
     that which I fear most is lest continual attendance and business
     together with these cares and want of time to do my weak body
     right this spring by diet and physic will cast me down and then
     it will be thought feigning or fainting But I hope in God I shall
     hold out God prosper you

The first charges attracted others which were made formal matters of
complaint by the House of Commons John Churchill to save himself was
busy setting down cases of misdoing and probably suitors of themselves
became ready to volunteer evidence But of this Bacon as yet knew
nothing He was at this time only aware that there were persons who were
hunting out complaints against him that the attack was changed from
his law to his private character he had found an unfavourable feeling
in the House of Lords and he knew well enough what it was to have
powerful enemies in those days when a sentence was often settled before
a trial To any one such a state of things was as formidable as the
first serious symptoms of a fever He was uneasy as a man might well be
on whom the House of Commons had fixed its eye and to whom the House of
Lords had shown itself unfriendly But he was as yet conscious of
nothing fatal to his defence and he knew that if false accusations
could be lightly made they could also be exposed

A few days after the first mention of corruption the Commons laid their
complaints of him before the House of Lords and on the same day March
   Bacon finding himself too ill to go to the House wrote to the
Peers by Buckingham requesting them that as some complaints of base
bribery had come before them they would give him a fair opportunity of
defending himself and of cross-examining witnesses especially begging
that considering the number of decrees which he had to make in a
year more than two thousand and the courses which had been taken in
hunting out complaints against him they would not let their opinion of
him be affected by the mere number of charges that might be made Their
short verbal answer moved by Southampton March    that they meant to
proceed by right rule of justice and would be glad if he cleared his
honour was not encouraging And now that the Commons had brought the
matter before them the Lords took it entirely into their own hands
appointing three Committees and examining the witnesses themselves New
witnesses came forward every day with fresh cases of gifts and presents
bribes received by the Lord Chancellor When Parliament rose for the
Easter vacation March   -April    the Committees continued sitting A
good deal probably passed of which no record remains When the Commons
met again April    Coke was full of gibes about Instauratio
Magna the true Instauratio was to restore laws and two days after
an Act was brought in for review and reversal of decrees in Courts of
Equity It was now clear that the case against Bacon had assumed
formidable dimensions and also a very strange and almost monstrous
shape For the Lords who were to be the judges had by their Committees
taken the matter out of the hands of the Commons the original accusers
and had become themselves the prosecutors collecting and arranging
evidence accepting or rejecting depositions and doing all that
counsel or the committing magistrate would do preliminary to a trial
There appears to have been no cross-examining of witnesses on Bacon's
behalf or hearing witnesses for him not unnaturally at this stage of
business when the prosecutors were engaged in making out their own
case but considering that the future judges had of their own accord
turned themselves into the prosecutors the unfairness was great At the
same time it does not appear that Bacon did anything to watch how things
went in the Committees which had his friends in them as well as his
enemies and are said to have been open courts Towards the end of
March Chamberlain wrote to Carleton that the Houses were working hard
at cleansing out the Augæan stable of monopolies and also extortions in
Courts of Justice The petitions against the Lord Chancellor were too
numerous to be got through his chief friends and brokers of bargains
Sir George Hastings and Sir Richard Young and others attacked are
obliged to accuse him in their own defence though very reluctantly His
ordinary bribes were £    £    and even £     The Lords admit no
evidence except on oath One Churchill who was dismissed from the
Chancery Court for extortion is the chief cause of the Chancellor's
ruin  Bacon was greatly alarmed He wrote to Buckingham who was
his anchor in these floods He wrote to the King he was at a loss to
account for the tempest that had come on him he could not understand
what he had done to offend the country or Parliament he had never
taken rewards to pervert justice however he might be frail and
partake of the abuse of the time

     Time hath been when I have brought unto you genitum columbæ
     from others Now I bring it from myself I fly unto your Majesty
     with the wings of a dove which once within these seven days I
     thought would have carried me a higher flight

     When I enter into myself I find not the materials of such a
     tempest as is comen upon me I have been as your Majesty knoweth
     best never author of any immoderate counsel but always desired to
     have things carried suavibus modis I have been no avaricious
     oppressor of the people I have been no haughty or intolerable or
     hateful man in my conversation or carriage I have inherited no
     hatred from my father but am a good patriot born Whence should
     this be For these are the things that use to raise dislikes
     abroad

And he ended by entreating the King to help him

     That which I thirst after as the hart after the streams is that
     I may know by my matchless friend Buckingham that presenteth to
     you this letter your Majesty's heart which is an abyssus of
     goodness as I am an abyssus of misery towards me I have been
     ever your man and counted myself but an usufructuary of myself
     the property being yours and now making myself an oblation to do
     with me as may best conduce to the honour of your justice the
     honour of your mercy and the use of your service resting as

     Clay in your Majesty's gracious hands
     Fr St Aldan Canc
     March        

To the world he kept up an undismayed countenance he went down to
Gorhambury attended by troops of friends This man said Prince
Charles when he met his company scorns to go out like a snuff But
at Gorhambury he made his will leaving his name to the next ages and
to foreign nations and he wrote a prayer which is a touching evidence
of his state of mind 

     Most gracious Lord God my merciful Father from my youth up my
     Creator my Redeemer my Comforter Thou O Lord soundest and
     searchest the depths and secrets of all hearts thou knowledgest
     the upright of heart thou judgest the hypocrite thou ponderest
     men's thoughts and doings as in a balance thou measurest their
     intentions as with a line vanity and crooked ways cannot be hid
     from thee

     Remember O Lord how thy servant hath walked before thee
     remember what I have first sought and what hath been principal in
     mine intentions I have loved thy assemblies I have mourned for
     the divisions of thy Church I have delighted in the brightness of
     thy sanctuary This vine which thy right hand hath planted in this
     nation I have ever prayed unto thee that it might have the first
     and the latter rain and that it might stretch her branches to the
     seas and to the floods The state and bread of the poor and
     oppressed have been precious in my eyes I have hated all cruelty
     and hardness of heart I have though in a despised weed procured
     the good of all men If any have been mine enemies I thought not
     of them neither hath the sun almost set upon my displeasure but I
     have been as a dove free from superfluity of maliciousness Thy
     creatures have been my books but thy Scriptures much more I have
     sought thee in the courts fields and gardens but I have found
     thee in thy temples

     Thousand have been my sins and ten thousand my transgressions
     but thy sanctifications have remained with me and my heart
     through thy grace hath been an unquenched coal upon thy altar O
     Lord my strength I have since my youth met with thee in all my
     ways by thy fatherly compassions by thy comfortable
     chastisements and by thy most visible providence As thy favours
     have increased upon me so have thy corrections so as thou hast
     been alway near me O Lord and ever as my worldly blessings were
     exalted so secret darts from thee have pierced me and when I have
     ascended before men I have descended in humiliation before thee

     And now when I thought most of peace and honour thy hand is heavy
     upon me and hath humbled me according to thy former
     loving-kindness keeping me still in thy fatherly school not as a
     bastard but as a child Just are thy judgements upon me for my
     sins which are more in number than the sands of the sea but have
     no proportion to thy mercies for what are the sands of the sea to
     the sea earth heavens and all these are nothing to thy mercies

     Besides my innumerable sins I confess before thee that I am
     debtor to thee for the gracious talent of thy gifts and graces
     which I have misspent in things for which I was least fit so as I
     may truly say my soul hath been a stranger in the course of my
     pilgrimage Be merciful unto me O Lord for my Saviour's sake
     and receive me into thy bosom or guide me in thy ways

Bacon up to this time strangely if the Committees were open Courts
was entirely ignorant of the particulars of the charge which was
accumulating against him He had an interview with the King which was
duly reported to the House and he placed his case before James
distinguishing between the three cases of bribery supposed in a
judge a corrupt bargain carelessness in receiving a gift while the
cause is going on and what is innocent receiving a gift after it is
ended And he meant in such words as these to place himself at the
King's disposal and ask his direction

     For my fortune summa summarum with me is that I may not be
     made altogether unprofitable to do your Majesty service or honour
     If your Majesty continue me as I am I hope I shall be a new man
     and shall reform things out of feeling more than another can do
     out of example If I cast part of my burden I shall be more strong
     and delivré to bear the rest And to tell your Majesty what my
     thoughts run upon I think of writing a story of England and of
     recompiling of your laws into a better digest

The King referred him to the House and the House now April   th
prepared to gather up into one brief the charges against the Lord
Chancellor still however continuing open to receive fresh complaints

Meanwhile the chase after abuses of all kinds was growing hotter in the
Commons abuses in patents and monopolies which revived the complaints
against referees among whom Bacon was frequently named and abuses in
the Courts of Justice The attack passed by and spared the Common Law
Courts as was noticed in the course of the debates it spared
Cranfield's Court the Court of Wards But it fell heavily on the
Chancery and the Ecclesiastical Courts I have neither power nor will
to defend Chancery said Sir John Bennett the judge of the Prerogative
Court but a few weeks after his turn came and a series of as ugly
charges as could well be preferred against a judge charges of extortion
as well as bribery were reported to the House by its Committee There
can be no doubt of the grossness of many of these abuses and the zeal
against them was honest though it would have shown more courage if it
had flown at higher game but the daily discussion of them helped to
keep alive and inflame the general feeling against so great a
delinquent as the Lord Chancellor was supposed to be And indeed two
of the worst charges against him were made before the Commons One was a
statement made in the House by Sir George Hastings a member of the
House who had been the channel of Awbry's gift that when he had told
Bacon that if questioned he must admit it Bacon's answer was George
if you do so I must deny it upon my honour upon my oath The other
was that he had given an opinion in favour of some claim of the Masters
in Chancery for which he received £     and with which he said that all
the judges agreed an assertion which all the judges denied Of these
charges there is no contradiction 

Bacon made one more appeal to the King April    He hoped that by
resigning the seal he might be spared the sentence

     But now if not per omnipotentiam as the divines speak but
     per potestatem suaviter disponentem your Majesty will graciously
     save me from a sentence with the good liking of the House and that
     cup may pass from me it is the utmost of my desires

     This I move with the more belief because I assure myself that if
     it be reformation that is sought the very taking away the seal
     upon my general submission will be as much in example for these
     four hundred years as any furder severity

At length informally but for the first time distinctly the full
nature of the accusation with its overwhelming list of cases came to
Bacon's knowledge April    or    From the single charge made in the
middle of March it had swelled in force and volume like a rising
mountain torrent That all these charges should have sprung out of the
ground from their long concealment is strange enough How is it that
nothing was heard of them when the things happened And what is equally
strange is that these charges were substantially true and undeniable
that this great Lord Chancellor so admirable in his despatch of
business hitherto so little complained of for wrong or unfair
decisions had been in the habit of receiving large sums of money from
suitors in some cases certainly while the suit was pending And
further while receiving them while perfectly aware of the evil of
receiving gifts on the seat of judgment while emphatically warning
inferior judges against yielding to the temptation he seems really to
have continued unconscious of any wrong-doing while gift after gift was
offered and accepted But nothing is so strange as the way in which
Bacon met the charges Tremendous as the accusation was he made not the
slightest fight about it Up to this time he had held himself innocent
Now overwhelmed and stunned he made no attempt at defence he threw up
the game without a struggle and volunteered an absolute and unreserved
confession of his guilt that is to say he declined to stand his trial
Only he made an earnest application to the House of Lords in
proceeding to sentence to be content with a general admission of
guilt and to spare him the humiliation of confessing the separate facts
of alleged bribery which were contained in the twenty-eight Articles
of his accusation This submission grounded only on rumour for the
Articles of charge had not yet been communicated to him by the accusers
took the House by surprise No Lord spoke to it after it had been
read for a long time But they did not mean that he should escape with
this The House treated the suggestion with impatient scorn April   
It is too late said Lord Saye No word of confession of any
corruption in the Lord Chancellor's submission said Southampton it
stands with the justice and honour of this House not to proceed without
the parties' particular confession or to have the parties to hear the
charge and we to hear the parties answer The demand of the Lords was
strictly just but cruel the Articles were now sent to him he had been
charged with definite offences he must answer yes or no confess them
or defend himself A further question arose whether he should not be
sent for to appear at the bar He still held the seals Shall the Great
Seal come to the bar asked Lord Pembroke It was agreed that he was to
be asked whether he would acknowledge the particulars His answer was
that he will make no manner of defence to the charge but meaneth to
acknowledge corruption and to make a particular confession to every
point and after that a humble submission But he humbly craves liberty
that when the charge is more full than he finds the truth of the fact
he may make a declaration of the truth in such particulars the charge
being brief and containing not all the circumstances And such a
confession he made My Lords he said to those who were sent to ask
whether he would stand to it it is my act my hand my heart I
beseech your Lordships be merciful to a broken reed This was of
course followed by a request to the King from the House to sequester
the Great Seal A commission was sent to receive it May   The worse
the better he answered to the wish that it had been better with
him By the King's great favour I received the Great Seal by my own
great fault I have lost it They intended him now to come to the bar to
receive his sentence But he was too ill to leave his bed They did not
push this point farther but proceeded to settle the sentence May  
He had asked for mercy but he did not get it There were men who talked
of every extremity short of death Coke indeed in the Commons from
his store of precedents had cited cases where judges had been hanged
for bribery But the Lords would not hear of this His offences foul
said Lord Arundel his confession pitiful Life not to be touched But
Southampton whom twenty years before he had helped to involve in
Essex's ruin urged that he should be degraded from the peerage and
asked whether at any rate he whom this House thinks unfit to be a
constable shall come to the Parliament He was fined £      He was to
be imprisoned in the Tower during the King's pleasure He was to be
incapable of any office place or employment in the State or
Commonwealth He was never to sit in Parliament or come within the verge
of the Court This was agreed to Buckingham only dissenting The Lord
Chancellor is so sick he said that he cannot live long

What is the history of this tremendous catastrophe by which in less
than two months Bacon was cast down from the height of fortune to
become a byword of shame He had enemies who certainly were glad but
there is no appearance that it was the result of any plot or
combination against him He was involved accidentally it may almost be
said in the burst of anger excited by the intolerable dealings of
others The indignation provoked by Michell and Mompesson and their
associates at that particular moment found Bacon in its path doing as
it seemed in his great seat of justice even worse than they and when
he threw up all attempt at defence and his judges had his hand to an
unreserved confession of corruption both generally and in the long
list of cases alleged against him it is not wonderful that they came to
the conclusion as the rest of the world did that he was as bad as the
accusation painted him a dishonest and corrupt judge Yet it is strange
that they should not have observed that not a single charge of a
definitely unjust decision was brought at any rate was proved against
him He had taken money they argued and therefore he must be corrupt
but if he had taken money to pervert judgment some instance of the
iniquity would certainly have been brought forward and proved There is
no such instance to be found though of course there were plenty of
dissatisfied suitors of course the men who had paid their money and
lost their cause were furious But in vain do we look for any case of
proved injustice The utmost that can be said is that in some cases he
showed favour in pushing forward and expediting suits So that the real
charge against Bacon assumes to us who have not to deal practically
with dangerous abuses but to judge conduct and character a different
complexion Instead of being the wickedness of perverting justice and
selling his judgments for bribes it takes the shape of allowing and
sharing in a dishonourable and mischievous system of payment for
service which could not fail to bring with it temptation and
discredit and in which fair reward could not be distinguished from
unlawful gain Such a system it was high time to stop and in this rough
and harsh way which also satisfied some personal enmities it was
stopped We may put aside for good the charge on which he was condemned
and which in words he admitted of being corrupt as a judge His real
fault and it was a great one was that he did not in time open his eyes
to the wrongness and evil patent to every one and to himself as soon
as pointed out of the traditional fashion in his court of eking out by
irregular gifts the salary of such an office as his

Thus Bacon was condemned both to suffering and to dishonour and as has
been observed condemned without a trial But it must also be observed
that it was entirely owing to his own act that he had not a trial and
with a trial the opportunity of cross-examining witnesses and of
explaining openly the matters urged against him The proceedings in the
Lords were preliminary to the trial when the time came Bacon of his
own choice stopped them from going farther by his confession and
submission Considering the view which he claimed to take of his own
case his behaviour was wanting in courage and spirit From the moment
that the attack on him shifted from a charge of authorising illegal
monopolies to a charge of personal corruption he never fairly met his
accusers The distress and anxiety no doubt broke down his health and
twice when he was called upon to be in his place in the House of Lords
he was obliged to excuse himself on the ground that he was too ill to
leave his bed But between the time of the first charge and his
condemnation seven weeks elapsed and though he was able to go down to
Gorhambury he never in that time showed himself in the House of Lords
Whether or not while the Committees were busy in collecting the
charges he would have been allowed to take part to put questions to
the witnesses or to produce his own he never attempted to do so and
by the course he took there was no other opportunity To have stood his
trial could hardly have increased his danger or aggravated his
punishment and it would only have been worthy of his name and place if
not to have made a fight for his character and integrity at least to
have bravely said what he had made up his mind to admit and what no one
could have said more nobly and pathetically in open Parliament But he
was cowed at the fierceness of the disapprobation manifest in both
Houses He shrunk from looking his peers and his judges in the face His
friends obtained for him that he should not be brought to the bar and
that all should pass in writing But they saved his dignity at the
expense of his substantial reputation The observation that the charges
against him were not sifted by cross-examination applies equally to his
answers to them The allegations of both sides would have come down to
us in a more trustworthy shape if the case had gone on But to give up
the struggle and to escape by any humiliation from a regular public
trial seems to have been his only thought when he found that the King
and Buckingham could not or would not save him

But the truth is that he knew that a trial of this kind was a trial only
in name He knew that when a charge of this sort was brought it was
not meant to be really investigated in open court but to be driven home
by proofs carefully prepared beforehand against which the accused had
little chance He knew too that in those days to resist in earnest an
accusation was apt to be taken as an insult to the court which
entertained it And further for the prosecutor to accept a submission
and confession without pushing to the formality of a public trial and
therefore a public exposure was a favour It was a favour which by his
advice as against the King's honour had been refused to Suffolk it
was a favour which in a much lighter charge had by his advice been
refused to his colleague Yelverton only a few months before when Bacon
in sentencing him took occasion to expatiate on the heinous guilt of
misprisions or mistakes in men in high places The humiliation was not
complete without the trial but it was for humiliation and not fair
investigation that the trial was wanted Bacon knew that the trial would
only prolong his agony and give a further triumph to his enemies

That there was any plot against Bacon and much more that Buckingham to
save himself was a party to it is of course absurd Buckingham indeed
was almost the only man in the Lords who said anything for Bacon and
alone he voted against his punishment But considering what Buckingham
was and what he dared to do when he pleased he was singularly cool in
helping Bacon Williams the astute Dean of Westminster who was to be
Bacon's successor as Lord Keeper had got his ear and advised him not
to endanger himself by trying to save delinquents He did not Indeed
as the inquiry went on he began to take the high moral ground he was
shocked at the Chancellor's conduct he would not have believed that it
could have been so bad his disgrace was richly deserved Buckingham
kept up appearances by saying a word for him from time to time in
Parliament which he knew would be useless and which he certainly took
no measures to make effective It is sometimes said that Buckingham
never knew what dissimulation was He was capable at least of the
perfidy and cowardice of utter selfishness Bacon's conspicuous fall
diverted men's thoughts from the far more scandalous wickedness of the
great favourite But though there was no plot though the blow fell upon
Bacon almost accidentally there were many who rejoiced to be able to
drive it home We can hardly wonder that foremost among them was Coke
This was the end of the long rivalry between Bacon and Coke from the
time that Essex pressed Bacon against Coke in vain to the day when Bacon
as Chancellor drove Coke from his seat for his bad law and as Privy
Councillor ordered him to be prosecuted in the Star Chamber for
riotously breaking open men's doors to get his daughter The two men
thoroughly disliked and undervalued one another Coke made light of
Bacon's law Bacon saw clearly Coke's narrowness and ignorance out of
that limited legal sphere in which he was supposed to know everything
his prejudiced and interested use of his knowledge his coarseness and
insolence But now in Parliament Coke was supreme our Hercules as
his friends said He posed as the enemy of all abuses and corruption He
brought his unrivalled though not always accurate knowledge of law and
history to the service of the Committees and took care that the
Chancellor's name should not be forgotten when it could be connected
with some bad business of patent or Chancery abuse It was the great
revenge of the Common Law on the encroaching and insulting Chancery
which had now proved so foul And he could not resist the opportunity of
marking the revenge of professional knowledge over Bacon's airs of
philosophical superiority To restore things to their original was his
sneer in Parliament this Instauratio Magna Instaurare
paras Instaura leges justitiamque prius 

The charge of corruption was as completely a surprise to Bacon as it was
to the rest of the world And yet as soon as the blot was hit he saw
in a moment that his position was hopeless he knew that he had been
doing wrong though all the time he had never apparently given it a
thought and he insisted what there is every reason to believe that no
present had induced him to give an unjust decision It was the power of
custom over a character naturally and by habit too pliant to
circumstances Custom made him insensible to the evil of receiving
recommendations from Buckingham in favour of suitors Custom made him
insensible to the evil of what it seems every one took for
granted receiving gifts from suitors In the Court of James I the
atmosphere which a man in office breathed was loaded with the taint of
gifts and bribes Presents were as much the rule as indispensable for
those who hoped to get on as they are now in Turkey Even in
Elizabeth's days when Bacon was struggling to win her favour and was
in the greatest straits for money he borrowed £    to buy a jewel for
the Queen When he was James's servant the giving of gifts became a
necessity New Year's Day brought round its tribute of gold vases and
gold pieces to the King and Buckingham And this was the least Money
was raised by the sale of officers and titles For £      having
previously offered £      in vain the Chief-Justice of England
Montague became Lord Mandeville and Treasurer The bribe was sometimes
disguised a man became a Privy Councillor like Cranfield or a
Chief-Justice like Ley afterwards the good Earl unstained with
gold or fee of Milton's Sonnet by marrying a cousin or a niece of
Buckingham When Bacon was made a Peer he had also given him the
making of a Baron that is to say he might raise money by bargaining
with some one who wanted a peerage when however later on he asked
Buckingham for a repetition of the favour Buckingham gave him a lecture
on the impropriety of prodigality which should make it seem that while
the King was asking money of Parliament with one hand he was giving with
the other How things were in Chancery in the days of the Queen and of
Bacon's predecessors we know little but Bacon himself implies that
there was nothing new in what he did All my lawyers said James are
so bred and nursed in corruption that they cannot leave it Bacon's
Chancellorship coincided with the full bloom of Buckingham's favour and
Buckingham set the fashion beyond all before him of extravagance in
receiving and spending Encompassed by such assumptions and such
customs Bacon administered the Chancery Suitors did there what people
did everywhere else they acknowledged by a present the trouble they
gave or the benefit they gained It may be that Bacon's known
difficulties about money his expensive ways and love of pomp his
easiness of nature his lax discipline over his servants encouraged
this profuseness of giving And Bacon let it be He asked no questions
he knew that he worked hard and well he knew that it could go on
without affecting his purpose to do justice from the greatest to the
groom A stronger character a keener conscience would have faced the
question not only whether he was not setting the most ruinous of
precedents but whether any man could be so sure of himself as to go on
dealing justly with gifts in his hands But Bacon who never dared to
face the question what James was what Buckingham was let himself be
spellbound by custom He knew in the abstract that judges ought to have
nothing to do with gifts and had said so impressively in his charges to
them Yet he went on self-complacent secure almost innocent building
up a great tradition of corruption in the very heart of English justice
till the challenge of Parliament which began in him its terrible and
relentless but most unequal prosecution of justice against ministers
who had betrayed the commonwealth in serving the Crown woke him from
his dream and made him see as others saw it the guilt of a great
judge who under whatever extenuating pretext allowed the suspicion to
arise that he might sell justice In the midst of a state of as great
affliction as mortal man can endure he wrote to the Lords of the
Parliament in making his submission I shall begin with the professing
gladness in some things The first is that hereafter the greatness of a
judge or magistrate shall be no sanctuary or protection of guiltiness
which is the beginning of a golden world The next that after this
example it is like that judges will fly from anything that is in the
likeness of corruption as from a serpent Bacon's own judgment on
himself deliberately repeated is characteristic and probably comes
near the truth Howsoever I acknowledge the sentence just and for
reformation's sake fit he writes to Buckingham from the Tower where
for form's sake he was imprisoned for a few miserable days he yet had
been the justest Chancellor that hath been in the five changes that
have been since Sir Nicolas Bacon's time He repeated the same thing
yet more deliberately in later times I was the justest judge that was
in England these fifty years But it was the justest censure in
Parliament that was these two hundred years

He might have gone on to add the Wisest Counsellor and yet none on
whom rested heavier blame none of whom England might more justly
complain Good counsels given submissive acquiescence in the
worst this is the history of his statesmanship Bacon whose eye was
everywhere was not sparing of his counsels On all the great questions
of the time he has left behind abundant evidence not only of what he
thought but of what he advised And in every case these memorials are
marked with the insight the independence the breadth of view and the
moderation of a mind which is bent on truth He started of course from
a basis which we are now hardly able to understand or allow for the
idea of absolute royal power and prerogative which James had enlarged
and hardened out of the Kingship of the Tudors itself imperious and
arbitrary enough but always seeking with a tact of which James was
incapable to be in touch and sympathy with popular feeling But it was
a basis which in principle every one of any account as yet held or
professed to hold and which Bacon himself held on grounds of philosophy
and reason He could see no hope for orderly and intelligent government
except in a ruler whose wisdom had equal strength to assert itself and
he looked down with incredulity and scorn on the notion of anything good
coming out of what the world then knew or saw of popular opinion or
parliamentary government But when it came to what was wise and fitting
for absolute power to do in the way of general measures and policy he
was for the most part right He saw the inexorable and pressing
necessity of putting the finance of the kingdom on a safe footing He
saw the necessity of a sound and honest policy in Ireland He saw the
mischief of the Spanish alliance in spite of his curious friendship with
Gondomar and detected the real and increasing weakness of the Spanish
monarchy which still awed mankind He saw the growing danger of abuses
in Church and State which were left untouched and were protected by the
punishment of those who dared to complain of them He saw the confusion
and injustice of much of that common law of which the lawyers were so
proud and would have attempted if he had been able to emulate
Justinian and anticipate the Code Napoleon by a rational and
consistent digest Above all he never ceased to impress on James the
importance and if wisely used the immense advantages of his
Parliaments Himself for great part of his life an active and popular
member of the House of Commons he saw that not only it was impossible
to do without it but that if fairly honourably honestly dealt with
it would become a source of power and confidence which would double the
strength of the Government both at home and abroad Yet of all this
wisdom nothing came The finance of the kingdom was still ruined by
extravagance and corruption in a time of rapidly-developing prosperity
and wealth The wounds of Ireland were unhealed It was neither peace
nor war with Spain and hot infatuation for its friendship alternated
with cold fits of distrust and estrangement Abuses flourished and
multiplied under great patronage The King's one thought about
Parliament was how to get as much money out of it as he could with as
little other business as possible Bacon's counsels were the prophecies
of Cassandra in that so prosperous but so disastrous reign All that he
did was to lend the authority of his presence in James's most intimate
counsels to policy and courses of which he saw the unwisdom and the
perils James and Buckingham made use of him when they wanted But they
would have been very different in their measures and their statesmanship
if they had listened to him

Mirabeau said what of course had been said before him On ne vaut
dans la partie exécutive de la vie humaine que par le caractère This
is the key to Bacon's failures as a judge and as a statesman and why
knowing so much more and judging so much more wisely than James and
Buckingham he must be identified with the misdoings of that ignoble
reign He had the courage of his opinions but a man wants more than
that he needs the manliness and the public spirit to enforce them if
they are true and salutary But this is what Bacon had not He did not
mind being rebuffed he knew that he was right and did not care But to
stand up against the King to contradict him after he had spoken to
press an opinion or a measure on a man whose belief in his own wisdom
was infinite to risk not only being set down as a dreamer but the
King's displeasure and the ruin of being given over to the will of his
enemies this Bacon had not the fibre or the stiffness or the
self-assertion to do He did not do what a man of firm will and strength
of purpose a man of high integrity of habitual resolution would have
done Such men insist when they are responsible and when they know
that they are right and they prevail or accept the consequences
Bacon knowing all that he did thinking all that he thought was
content to be the echo and the instrument of the cleverest the
foolishest the vainest the most pitiably unmanly of English kings

CHAPTER VII

BACON'S LAST YEARS

    -    


The tremendous sentences of those days with their crushing fines were
often worse in sound than in reality They meant that for the moment a
man was defeated and disgraced But it was quite understood that it did
not necessarily follow that they would be enforced in all their
severity The fine might be remitted the imprisonment shortened the
ban of exclusion taken off At another turn of events or caprice the man
himself might return to favour and take his place in Parliament or the
Council as if nothing had happened But of course a man might have
powerful enemies and the sentence might be pressed His fine might be
assigned to some favourite and he might be mined even if in the long
run he was pardoned or he might remain indefinitely a prisoner Raleigh
had remained to perish at last in dishonour Northumberland Raleigh's
fellow-prisoner after fifteen years' captivity was released this year
The year after Bacon's condemnation such criminals as Lord and Lady
Somerset were released from the Tower after a six years' imprisonment
Southampton the accomplice of Essex Suffolk sentenced as late as     
by Bacon for embezzlement sat in the House of Peers which judged Bacon
and both of them took a prominent part in judging him

To Bacon the sentence was ruinous It proved an irretrievable overthrow
as regards public life and though some parts of it were remitted and
others lightened it plunged his private affairs into trouble which
weighed heavily on him for his few remaining years To his deep distress
and horror he had to go to the Tower to satisfy the terms of his
sentence Good my Lord he writes to Buckingham May    procure my
warrant for my discharge this day Death is so far from being unwelcome
to me as I have called for it as far as Christian resolution would
permit any time these two months But to die before the time of his
Majesty's grace in this disgraceful place is even the worst that could
be He was released after two or three days and he thanks Buckingham
June   for getting him out to do him and the King faithful
service wherein by the grace of God your Lordship shall find that my
adversity hath neither spent nor pent my spirits In the autumn his
fine was remitted that is it was assigned to persons nominated by
Bacon who as the Crown had the first claim on all his goods served as
a protection against his other creditors who were many and some of them
clamorous and it was followed by his pardon His successor Williams
now Bishop of Lincoln who stood in great fear of Parliament tried to
stop the pardon The assignment of the fine he said to Buckingham was
a gross job it is much spoken against not for the matter for no man
objects to that but for the manner which is full of knavery and a
wicked precedent For by this assignment he is protected from all his
creditors which I dare say was neither his Majesty's nor your
Lordship's meaning It was an ill-natured and cowardly piece of
official pedantry to plunge deeper a drowning man but in the end the
pardon was passed It does not appear whether Buckingham interfered to
overrule the Lord Keeper's scruples Buckingham was certainly about this
time very much out of humour with Bacon for a reason which more than
anything else discloses the deep meanness which lurked under his show
of magnanimity and pride He had chosen this moment to ask Bacon for
York House This meant that Bacon would never more want it Even Bacon
was stung by such a request to a friend in his condition and declined
to part with it and Buckingham accordingly was offended and made Bacon
feel it Indeed there is reason to think with Mr Spedding that for the
sealing of his pardon Bacon was indebted to the good offices with the
King not of Buckingham but of the Spaniard Gondomar with whom Bacon
had always been on terms of cordiality and respect and who at this time
certainly brought about something on his behalf which his other
friends either had not dared to attempt or had not been able to obtain

But though Bacon had his pardon he had not received permission to come
within the verge of the Court which meant that he could not live in
London His affairs were in great disorder his health was bad and he
was cut off from books He wrote an appeal to the Peers who had
condemned him asking them to intercede with the King for the
enlargement of his liberty I am old he wrote weak ruined in
want a very subject of pity The Tower at least gave him the
neighbourhood of those who could help him There I could have company
physicians conference with my creditors and friends about my debts and
the necessities of my estate helps for my studies and the writings I
have in hand Here I live upon the sword-point of a sharp air
endangered if I go abroad dulled if I stay within solitary and
comfortless without company banished from all opportunities to treat
with any to do myself good and to help out my wrecks If the Lords
would recommend his suit to the King You shall do a work of charity
and nobility you shall do me good you shall do my creditors good and
it may be you shall do posterity good if out of the carcase of dead and
rotten greatness as out of Samson's lion there may be honey gathered
for the use of future times But Parliament was dissolved before the
touching appeal reached them and Bacon had to have recourse to other
expedients He consulted Selden about the technical legality of the
sentence He appealed to Buckingham who vouchsafed to appear more
placable Once more he had recourse to Gondomar in that solitude of
friends which is the base-court of adversity as a man whom he had
observed to have the magnanimity of his own nation and the cordiality
of ours and I am sure the wit of both and who had been equally kind
to him in both his fortunes and he proposed through Gondomar to
present Gorhambury to Buckingham for nothing as a peace-offering But
the purchase of his liberty was to come in another way Bacon had
reconciled himself to giving up York House but now Buckingham would not
have it he had found another house he said which suited him as well
That is to say he did not now choose to have York House from Bacon
himself but he meant to have it Accordingly Buckingham let Bacon know
through a friend of Bacon's Sir Edward Sackville that the price of his
liberty to live in London was the cession of York House not to
Buckingham but of all men in the world to Lionel Cranfield the man
who had been so bitter against Bacon in the House of Commons This is
Sir Edward Sackville's account to Bacon of his talk with Buckingham it
is characteristic of every one concerned

     In the forenoon he laid the law but in the afternoon he preached
     the gospel when after some revivations of the old distaste
     concerning York House he most nobly opened his heart unto me
     wherein I read that which augured much good towards you After
     which revelation the book was again sealed up and must in his own
     time only by himself be again manifested unto you I have leave to
     remember some of the vision and am not forbidden to write it He
     vowed not court like but constantly to appear your friend so
     much as if his Majesty should abandon the care of you you should
     share his fortune with him He pleased to tell me how much he had
     been beholden to you how well he loved you how unkindly he took
     the denial of your house for so he will needs understand it but
     the close for all this was harmonious since he protested he would
     seriously begin to study your ends now that the world should see
     he had no ends on you He is in hand with the work and therefore
     will by no means accept of your offer though I can assure you the
     tender hath much won upon him and mellowed his heart towards you
     and your genius directed you aright when you writ that letter of
     denial to the Duke The King saw it and all the rest which made
     him say unto the Marquis you played an after-game well and that
     now he had no reason to be much offended

     I have already talked of the Revelation and now am to speak in
     apocalyptical language which I hope you will rightly comment
     whereof if you make difficulty the bearer can help you with the
    key of the cypher

    My Lord Falkland by this time hath showed you London from Highgate
    If York House were gone the town were yours and all your
    straitest shackles clean off besides more comfort than the city air
    only The Marquis would be exceeding glad the Treasurer had it This
    I know yet this you must not know from me Bargain with him
    presently upon as good conditions as you can procure so you have
    direct motion from the Marquis to let him have it Seem not to dive
    into the secret of it though you are purblind if you see not
    through it I have told Mr Meautys how I would wish your Lordship
    now to make an end of it From him I beseech you take it and from
    me only the advice to perform it If you part not speedily with it
    you may defer the good which is approaching near you and
    disappointing other aims which must either shortly receive content
    or never perhaps anew yield matter of discontent though you may
    be indeed as innocent as before Make the Treasurer believe that
    since the Marquis will by no means accept of it and that you must
    part with it you are more willing to pleasure him than anybody
    else because you are given to understand my Lord Marquis so
    inclines which inclination if the Treasurer shortly send unto you
    about it desire may be more clearly manifested than as yet it hath
    been since as I remember none hitherto hath told you in terminis
    terminantibus that the Marquis desires you should gratify the
    Treasurer I know that way the hare runs and that my Lord Marquis
    longs until Cranfield hath it and so I wish too for your good yet
    would not it were absolutely passed until my Lord Marquis did send
    or write unto you to let him have it for then his so disposing of
    it were but the next degree removed from the immediate acceptance of
    it and your Lordship freed from doing it otherwise than to please
    him and to comply with his own will and way

It need hardly be said that when Cranfield got it it soon passed into
Buckingham's hands Bacon consented to part with his house and
Buckingham in return consented to give him his liberty Yet Bacon could
write to him low as I am I had rather sojourn in a college in
Cambridge than recover a good fortune by any other but yourself As
for York House he bids Toby Matthews to let Buckingham know that
whether in a straight line or a compass line I meant it for his
Lordship in the way which I thought might please him best But liberty
did not mean either money or recovered honour All his life long he had
made light of being in debt but since his fall this was no longer a
condition easy to bear He had to beg some kind of pension of the King
He had to beg of Buckingham a small matter for my debts would do me
more good now than double a twelvemonth hence I have lost six thousand
by the year besides caps and courtesies Two things I may assure your
Lordship The one that I shall lead such a course of life as whatsoever
the King doth for me shall rather sort to his Majesty's and your
Lordship's honour than to envy the other that whatsoever men talk I
can play the good husband and the King's bounty shall not be lost

It might be supposed from the tone of these applications that Bacon's
mind was bowed down and crushed by the extremity of his misfortune
Nothing could be farther from the truth In his behaviour during his
accusation there was little trace of that high spirit and fortitude
shown by far inferior men under like disasters But the moment the
tremendous strain of his misfortunes was taken off the vigour of his
mind recovered itself The buoyancy of his hopefulness the elasticity
of his energy are as remarkable as his profound depression When the
end was approaching his thoughts turned at once to other work to be
done ready in plan ready to be taken up and finished At the close of
his last desperate letter to the King he cannot resist finishing at once
with a jest and with the prospect of two great literary undertakings 

     This is my last suit which I shall make to your Majesty in this
     business prostrating myself at your mercy seat after fifteen
     years service wherein I have served your Majesty in my poor
     endeavours with an entire heart and as I presumed to say unto
     your Majesty am still a virgin for matters that concern your
     person and crown and now only craving that after eight steps of
     honour I be not precipitated altogether But because he that hath
     taken bribes is apt to give bribes I will go furder and present
     your Majesty with a bribe For if your Majesty will give me peace
     and leisure and God give me life I will present your Majesty with
     a good history of England and a better digest of your laws

The Tower did indeed to use a word of the time mate him But the
moment he was out of it his quick and fertile mind was immediately at
work in all directions reaching after all kinds of plans making proof
of all kinds of expedients to retrieve the past arranging all kinds of
work according as events might point out the way His projects for
history for law for philosophy for letters occupy quite as much of
his thoughts as his pardon and his debts and they we have seen
occupied a good deal If he was pusillanimous in the moment of the
storm his spirit his force his varied interests returned the moment
the storm was past His self-reliance which was boundless revived He
never allowed himself to think however men of his own time might judge
him that the future world would mistake him Aliquis fui inter
vivos he writes to Gondomar neque omnino intermoriar apud
posteros Even in his time he did not give up the hope of being
restored to honour and power He compared himself to Demosthenes to
Cicero to Seneca to Marcus Livius who had been condemned for corrupt
dealings as he had been and had all recovered favour and position
Lookers-on were puzzled and shocked He has writes Chamberlain no
manner of feeling of his fall but continuing vain and idle in all his
humours as when he was at the highest I am said Bacon himself
writes to have a feather in my head

Men were mistaken His thoughts were for the moment more than ever
turned to the future but he had not given up hope of having a good deal
to say yet to the affairs of the present Strangely enough as it seems
to us in the very summer after that fatal spring of      the King
called for his opinion concerning the reformation of Courts of Justice
and Bacon just sentenced for corruption and still unpardoned proceeds
to give his advice as if he were a Privy Councillor in confidential
employment Early in the following year he according to his fashion
surveyed his position and drew up a paper of memoranda like the notes
of the Commentarius Solutus of      about points to be urged to the
King at an interview Why should not the King employ him again Your
Majesty never chid me and as to his condemnation as the fault was
not against your Majesty so my fall was not your act Therefore he
goes on if your Majesty do at any time find it fit for your affairs to
employ me publicly upon the stage I shall so live and spend my time as
neither discontinuance shall disable me nor adversity shall discourage
me nor anything that I do give any new scandal or envy upon me He
insists very strongly that the King's service never miscarried in his
hands for he simply carried out the King's wise counsels That his
Majesty's business never miscarried in my hands I do not impute to any
extraordinary ability in myself but to my freedom from any particular
either friends or ends and my careful receipt of his directions being
as I have formerly said to him but as a bucket and cistern to that
fountain a bucket to draw forth a cistern to preserve He is not
afraid of the apparent slight to the censure passed on him by
Parliament For envy it is an almanack of the old year and as a
friend of mine said Parliament died penitent towards me What the
King bestows on me will be further seen than on Paul's steeple There
be mountebanks as well in the civil body as in the natural I ever
served his Majesty with modesty no shouting no undertaking In the
odd fashion of the time a fashion in which no one more delighted than
himself he lays hold of sacred words to give point to his argument

     I may allude to the three petitions of the Litany Libera nos
     Domine parce nobis Domine exaudi nos Domine In the first
     I am persuaded that his Majesty had a mind to do it and could not
     conveniently in respect of his affairs In the second he hath done
     it in my fine and pardon In the third he hath likewise
     performed in restoring to the light of his countenance

But if the King did not see fit to restore him to public employment he
would be ready to give private counsel and he would apply himself to
any literary province that the King appointed I am like ground
fresh If I be left to myself I will graze and bear natural philosophy
but if the King will plough me up again and sow me with anything I
hope to give him some yield Your Majesty hath power I have faith
Therefore a miracle may be wrought And he proposes for matters in
which his pen might be useful first as active works the recompiling
of laws the disposing of wards and generally the education of youth
the regulation of the jurisdiction of Courts and the regulation of
Trade and for contemplative the continuation of the history of Henry
VIII a general treatise de Legibus et Justitia and the Holy War
against the Ottomans

When he wrote this he had already shown what his unquelled energy could
accomplish In the summer and autumn after his condemnation amid all
the worries and inconveniences of that time moving about from place to
place without his books and without free access to papers and records
he had written his History of Henry VII The theme had no doubt been
long in his head But the book was the first attempt at philosophical
history in the language and it at once takes rank with all that the
world had yet seen in classical times and more recently in Italy of
such history He sent the book among other persons to the Queen of
Bohemia with a phrase the translation of a trite Latin commonplace
which may have been the parent of one which became famous in our time
and with an expression of absolute confidence in the goodness of his own
work

     I have read in books that it is accounted a great bliss for a man
     to have Leisure with Honour That was never my fortune For time
     was I had Honour without Leisure and now I have Leisure without
     Honour But my desire is now to have Leisure without
     Loitering and not to become an abbey-lubber as the old proverb
     was but to yield some fruit of my private life If King Henry
     were alive again I hope verily he would not be so angry with me
     for not flattering him as well pleased in seeing himself so truly
     described in colours that will last and be believed

But the tide had turned against him for good A few fair words a few
grudging doles of money to relieve his pressing wants and those
sometimes intercepted and perhaps never rightly granted from an
Exchequer which even Cranfield's finance could not keep filled were all
the graces that descended upon him from those fountains of goodness in
which he professed to trust with such boundless faith The King did not
want him perhaps did not trust him perhaps did not really like him
When the Novum Organum came out all that he had to say about it was
in the shape of a profane jest that it was like the peace of God it
passed all understanding Other men had the ear of Buckingham shrewd
practical men of business like Cranfield who hated Bacon's loose and
careless ways or the clever ecclesiastic Williams whose counsel had
steered Buckingham safely through the tempest that wrecked Bacon and
who with no legal training had been placed in Bacon's seat I
thought said Bacon that I should have known my successor Williams
for his part charged Bacon with trying to cheat his creditors when his
fine was remitted With no open quarrel Bacon's relations to Buckingham
became more ceremonious and guarded the My singular good Lord of the
former letters becomes now that Buckingham had risen so high and Bacon
had sunk so low Excellent Lord The one friend to whom Bacon had
once wished to owe everything had become the great man now only to be
approached with sweet meats and elaborate courtesy But it was no use
His full pardon Bacon did not get though earnestly suing for it that
he might not die in ignominy He never sat again in Parliament The
Provostship of Eton fell vacant and Bacon's hopes were kindled It
were a pretty cell for my fortune The College and School I do not doubt
but I shall make to flourish But Buckingham had promised it to some
nameless follower and by some process of exchange it went to Sir Henry
Wotton His English history was offered in vain His digest of the Laws
was offered in vain In vain he wrote a memorandum on the regulation of
usury notes of advice to Buckingham elaborate reports and notes of
speeches about a war with Spain when that for a while loomed before the
country In vain he affected an interest which he could hardly have felt
in the Spanish marriage and the escapade of Buckingham and Prince
Charles which began he wrote like a fable of the poets but
deserved all in a piece a worthy narration In vain when the Spanish
marriage was off and the French was on he proposed to offer to
Buckingham his service to live a summer as upon mine own delight at
Paris to settle a fast intelligence between France and us I have
somewhat of the French he said I love birds as the King doth
Public patronage and public employment were at an end for him His
petitions to the King and Buckingham ceased to be for office but for
the clearing of his name and for the means of living It is piteous to
read the earnestness of his requests Help me dear Sovereign lord and
master pity me so far as that I who have borne a bag be not now in my
age forced in effect to bear a wallet The words are from a
carefully-prepared and rhetorical letter which was not sent but they
express what he added to a letter presenting the De Augmentis det
Vestra Majestas obolum Belisario Again I prostrate myself at your
Majesty's feet I your ancient servant now sixty-four years old in age
and three years and five months old in misery I desire not from your
Majesty means nor place nor employment but only after so long a time
of expiation a complete and total remission of the sentence of the
Upper House to the end that blot of ignominy may be removed from me
and from my memory and posterity that I die not a condemned man but
may be to your Majesty as I am to God nova creatura But the pardon
never came Sir John Bennett who had been condemned as a corrupt judge
by the same Parliament and between whose case and Bacon's there was as
much difference I will not say as between black and white but as
between black and gray had got his full pardon and they say shall
sit in Parliament Lord Suffolk had been one of Bacon's judges I hope
I deserve not to be the only outcast But whether the Court did not
care or whether as he once suspected there was some old enemy like
Coke who had a tooth against him and was watching any favour shown
him he died without his wish being fulfilled to live out of want and
to die out of ignominy

Bacon was undoubtedly an impoverished man and straitened in his means
but this must be understood as in relation to the rank and position
which he still held and the work which he wanted done for the
Instauratio His will dated a few months before his death shows that
it would be a mistake to suppose that he was in penury He no doubt
often wanted ready money and might be vexed by creditors But he kept a
large household and was able to live in comfort at Gray's Inn or at
Gorhambury A man who speaks in his will of his four coach geldings
and his best caroache besides many legacies and who proposes to found
two lectures at the universities may have troubles about debts and be
cramped in his expenditure but it is only relatively to his station
that he can be said to be poor And to subordinate officers of the
Treasury who kept him out of his rights he could still write a sharp
letter full of his old force and edge A few months before his death he
thus wrote to the Lord Treasurer Ley who probably had made some
difficulty about a claim for money

     MY LORD I humbly entreat your Lordship and if I may use the
     word advise your Lordship to make me a better answer Your
     Lordship is interested in honour in the opinion of all that hear
     how I am dealt with If your Lordship malice me for Long's cause
     surely it was one of the justest businesses that ever was in
     Chancery I will avouch it and how deeply I was tempted therein
     your Lordship knoweth best Your Lordship may do well to think of
     your grave as I do of mine and to beware of hardness of heart And
     as for fair words it is a wind by which neither your Lordship nor
     any man else can sail long Howsoever I am the man that shall give
     all due respects and reverence to your great place

       th June     
     FR ST ALBAN

Bacon always claimed that he was not vindicative But considering how
Bishop Williams when he was Lord Keeper had charged Bacon with
knavery and deceiving his creditors in the arrangements about his
fine it is not a little strange to find that at the end of his life
Bacon had so completely made friends with him that he chose him as the
person to whom he meant to leave his speeches and letters which he was
willing should not be lost and also the charge of superintending two
foundations of £    a year for Natural Science at the universities And
the Bishop accepted the charge

The end of this one of the most pathetic of histories was at hand
the end was not the less pathetic because it came in so homely a
fashion On a cold day in March he stopped his coach in the snow on his
way to Highgate to try the effect of cold in arresting putrefaction He
bought a hen from a woman by the way and stuffed it with snow He was
taken with a bad chill which forced him to stop at a strange house
Lord Arundel's to whom he wrote his last letter a letter of apology
for using his house He did not write the letter as a dying man But
disease had fastened on him A few days after early on Easter morning
April        he passed away He was buried at St Albans in the
Church of St Michael the only Christian church within the walls of
old Verulam For my name and memory he said in his will I leave it
to men's charitable speeches and to foreign nations and the next ages
So he died the brightest richest largest mind but one in the age
which had seen Shakespeare and his fellows so bright and rich and large
that there have been found those who identify him with the writer of
Hamlet and Othello That is idle Bacon could no more have written
the plays than Shakespeare could have prophesied the triumphs of natural
philosophy So ended a career than which no other in his time had
grander and nobler aims aims however mistaken for the greatness and
good of England aims for the enlargement of knowledge and truth and
for the benefit of mankind So ended a career which had mounted slowly
and painfully but resolutely to the highest pinnacle of
greatness greatness full of honour and beneficent activity suddenly to
plunge down to depths where honour and hope were irrecoverable So
closed in disgrace and disappointment and neglect the last sad chapter
of a life which had begun so brightly which had achieved such permanent
triumphs which had lost itself so often in the tangles of insincerity
and evil custom which was disfigured and marred by great misfortunes
and still more by great mistakes of his own which was in many ways
misunderstood not only by his generation but by himself but which he
left in the constant and almost unaccountable faith that it would be
understood and greatly honoured by posterity With all its glories it
was the greatest shipwreck the greatest tragedy of an age which saw
many

But in these gloomy and dreary days of depression and vain hope to which
his letters bear witness three years and five months old in misery
again later a long cleansing week of five years' expiation and
more his interest in his great undertaking and his industry never
flagged The King did not want what he offered did not want his
histories did not want his help about law Well then he had work of
his own on which his heart was set and if the King did not want his
time he had the more for himself Even in the busy days of his
Chancellorship he had prepared and carried through the press the Novum
Organum which he published on the very eve of his fall It was one of
those works which quicken a man's powers and prove to him what he can
do and it had its effect His mind was never more alert than in these
years of adversity his labour never more indefatigable his powers of
expression never more keen and versatile and strong Besides the
political writings of grave argument for which he found time these five
years teem with the results of work In the year before his death he
sketched out once more in a letter to a Venetian correspondent Fra
Fulgenzio the friend of Sarpi the plan of his great work on which he
was still busy though with fast diminishing hopes of seeing it
finished To another foreign correspondent a professor of philosophy
at Annecy and a distinguished mathematician Father Baranzan who had
raised some questions about Bacon's method and had asked what was to be
done with metaphysics he wrote in eager acknowledgment of the interest
which his writings had excited and insisting on the paramount
necessity above everything of the observation of facts and of natural
history out of which philosophy may be built But the most
comprehensive view of his intellectual projects in all directions the
fullest account of his own personal feelings and designs as a writer
which we have from his own pen is given in a letter to the venerable
friend of his early days Bishop Andrewes who died a few months after
him Part he says of his Instauratio the work in mine own
judgement si nunquam fallit imago I do most esteem has been
published but because he doubts that it flies too high over men's
heads he proposes to draw it down to the sense by examples of
Natural History He has enlarged and translated the Advancement into
the De Augmentis Because he could not altogether desert the civil
person that he had borne he had begun a work on Laws intermediate
between philosophical jurisprudence and technical law He had hoped to
compile a digest of English law but found it more than he could do
alone and had laid it aside The Instauratio had contemplated the
good of men in the dowries of nature the Laws their good in
society and the dowries of government As he owed duty to his country
and could no longer do it service he meant to do it honour by his
history of Henry VII His Essays were but recreations and
remembering that all his writings had hitherto gone all into the City
and none into the Temple he wished to make some poor oblation and
therefore had chosen an argument mixed of religious and civil
considerations the dialogue of an Holy War against the Ottoman
which he never finished but which he intended to dedicate to Andrewes
in respect of our ancient and private acquaintance and because amongst
the men of our times I hold you in special reverence

The question naturally presents itself in regard to a friend of Bishop
Andrewes What was Bacon as regards religion And the answer it seems
to me can admit of no doubt The obvious and superficial thing to say
is that his religion was but an official one a tribute to custom and
opinion But it was not so Both in his philosophical thinking and in
the feelings of his mind in the various accidents and occasions of life
Bacon was a religious man with a serious and genuine religion His
sense of the truth and greatness of religion was as real as his sense of
the truth and greatness of nature they were interlaced together and
could not be separated though they were to be studied separately and
independently The call repeated through all his works from the
earliest to the last Da Fidel quæ Fidel sunt was a warning against
confusing the two but was an earnest recognition of the claims of each
The solemn religious words in which his prefaces and general statements
often wind up with thanksgiving and hope and prayer are no mere words
of course they breathe the spirit of the deepest conviction It is true
that he takes the religion of Christendom as he finds it The grounds of
belief the relation of faith to reason the profounder inquiries into
the basis of man's knowledge of the Eternal and Invisible are out of
the circle within which he works What we now call the philosophy of
religion is absent from his writings In truth his mind was not
qualified to grapple with such questions There is no sign in his
writings that he ever tried his strength against them that he ever
cared to go below the surface into the hidden things of mind and what
mind deals with above and beyond sense those metaphysical difficulties
and depths as we call them which there is no escaping and which are
as hard to explore and as dangerous to mistake as the forces and
combinations of external nature But it does not follow because he had
not asked all the questions that others have asked that he had not
thought out his reasonable faith His religion was not one of mere vague
sentiment it was the result of reflection and deliberate judgment It
was the discriminating and intelligent Church of England religion of
Hooker and Andrewes which had gone back to something deeper and nobler
in Christianity than the popular Calvinism of the earlier Reformation
and though sternly hostile to the system of the Papacy both on
religious and political grounds attempted to judge it with knowledge
and justice This deliberate character of his belief is shown in the
remarkable Confession of Faith which he left behind him a
closely-reasoned and nobly-expressed survey of Christian theology a
summa theologiæ digested into seven pages of the finest English of
the days when its tones were finest The entire scheme of Christian
theology as Mr Spedding says is constantly in his thoughts
underlies everything defines for him the limits of human speculation
and as often as the course of inquiry touches at any point the boundary
line never fails to present itself There is hardly any occasion or any
kind of argument into which it does not at one time or another
incidentally introduce itself Doubtless it was a religion which in him
was compatible as it has been in others with grave faults of
temperament and character But it is impossible to doubt that it was
honest that it elevated his thoughts that it was a refuge and stay in
the times of trouble




CHAPTER VIII

BACON'S PHILOSOPHY


Bacon was one of those men to whom posterity forgives a great deal for
the greatness of what he has done and attempted for posterity It is
idle unless all honest judgment is foregone to disguise the many
deplorable shortcomings of his life it is unjust to have one measure
for him and another for those about him and opposed to him But it is
not too much to say that in temper in honesty in labour in humility
in reverence he was the most perfect example that the world had yet
seen of the student of nature the enthusiast for knowledge That such a
man was tempted and fell and suffered the Nemesis of his fall is an
instance of the awful truth embodied in the tragedy of Faust But his
genuine devotion so unwearied and so paramount to a great idea and a
great purpose for the good of all generations to come must shield him
from the insult of Pope's famous and shallow epigram Whatever may have
been his sins and they were many he cannot have been the meanest of
mankind who lived and died holding unaltered amid temptations and
falls so noble a conception of the use and calling of his life the
duty and service of helping his brethren to know as they had never yet
learned to know That thought never left him the obligations it imposed
were never forgotten in the crush and heat of business the toils
thankless at the time which it heaped upon him in addition to the
burdens of public life were never refused Nothing diverted him nothing
made him despair He was not discouraged because he was not understood
There never was any one in whose life the Souveraineté du but was
more certain and more apparent and that object was the second greatest
that man can have To teach men to know is only next to making them
good

The Baconian philosophy the reforms of the Novum Organum the method
of experiment and induction are commonplaces and sometimes lead to a
misconception of what Bacon did Bacon is and is not the founder of
modern science What Bacon believed could be done what he hoped and
divined for the correction and development of human knowledge was one
thing what his methods were and how far they were successful is
another It would hardly be untrue to say that though Bacon is the
parent of modern science his methods contributed nothing to its actual
discoveries neither by possibility could they have done so The great
and wonderful work which the world owes to him was in the idea and not
in the execution The idea was that the systematic and wide examination
of facts was the first thing to be done in science and that till this
had been done faithfully and impartially with all the appliances and
all the safeguards that experience and forethought could suggest all
generalisations all anticipations from mere reasoning must be
adjourned and postponed and further that sought on these conditions
knowledge certain and fruitful beyond all that men then imagined
could be attained His was the faith of the discoverer the imagination
of the poet the voice of the prophet But his was not the warrior's
arm the engineer's skill the architect's creativeness I only sound
the clarion he says but I enter not into the battle and with a
Greek quotation very rare with him he compares himself to one of
Homer's peaceful heralds Greek chairete kêrukes Dios angeloi êde kai
andrôn Even he knew not the full greatness of his own enterprise He
underrated the vastness and the subtlety of nature He overrated his own
appliances to bring it under his command He had not that incommunicable
genius and instinct of the investigator which in such men as Faraday
close hand to hand with phenomena His weapons and instruments wanted
precision they were powerful up to a certain point but they had the
clumsiness of an unpractised time Cowley compared him to Moses on
Pisgah surveying the promised land it was but a distant survey and
Newton was the Joshua who began to take possession of it

The idea of the great enterprise in its essential outline and with a
full sense of its originality and importance was early formed and was
even sketched on paper with Bacon's characteristic self-reliance when he
was but twenty-five Looking back in a letter written in the last year
of his life on the ardour and constancy with which he had clung to his
faith in that purpose my mind never waxed old in that long interval
of time it never cooled he remarks that it was then forty years since
he put together a youthful essay on these matters which with vast
confidence I called by the high-sounding title The Greatest Birth of
Time The Greatest Birth of Time whatever it was has perished
though the name altered to Partus Temporis Masculus has survived
attached to some fragments of uncertain date and arrangement But in
very truth the child was born and as Bacon says for forty years grew
and developed with many changes yet the same Bacon was most
tenacious not only of ideas but even of the phrases images and turns
of speech in which they had once flashed on him and taken shape in his
mind The features of his undertaking remained the same from first to
last only expanded and enlarged as time went on and experience widened
his conviction that the knowledge of nature and with it the power to
command and to employ nature were within the capacity of mankind and
might be restored to them the certainty that of this knowledge men had
as yet acquired but the most insignificant part and that all existing
claims to philosophical truth were as idle and precarious as the guesses
and traditions of the vulgar his belief that no greater object could be
aimed at than to sweep away once and for ever all this sham knowledge
and all that supported it and to lay an entirely new and clear
foundation to build on for the future his assurance that as it was
easy to point out with fatal and luminous certainty the rottenness and
hollowness of all existing knowledge and philosophy so it was equally
easy to devise and practically apply new and natural methods of
investigation and construction which should replace it by knowledge of
infallible truth and boundless fruitfulness His object to gain the key
to the interpretation of nature his method to gain it not by the
means common to all previous schools of philosophy by untested
reasonings and imposing and high-sounding generalisations but by a
series and scale of rigorously verified inductions starting from the
lowest facts of experience to discoveries which should prove and realise
themselves by leading deductively to practical results these in one
form or another were the theme of his philosophical writings from the
earliest sight of them that we gain

He had disclosed what was in his mind in the letter to Lord Burghley
written when he was thirty-one        in which he announced that he
had taken all knowledge for his province to purge it of 'frivolous
disputations' and 'blind experiments' and that whatever happened to
him he meant to be a 'true pioneer in the mine of truth' But the
first public step in the opening of his great design was the publication
in the autumn of      of the Advancement of Learning a careful and
balanced report on the existing stock and deficiencies of human
knowledge His endeavours as he says in the Advancement itself are
but as an image in a cross-way that may point out the way but cannot
go it But from this image of his purpose his thoughts greatly widened
as time went on The Advancement in part at least was probably a
hurried work It shadowed out but only shadowed out the lines of his
proposed reform of philosophical thought it showed his dissatisfaction
with much that was held to be sound and complete and showed the
direction of his ideas and hopes But it was many years before he took a
further step Active life intervened In      at the height of his
prosperity on the eve of his fall he published the long meditated
Novum Organum the avowed challenge to the old philosophies the
engine and instrument of thought and discovery which was to put to shame
and supersede all others containing in part at least the principles
of that new method of the use of experience which was to be the key to
the interpretation and command of nature and together with the method
an elaborate but incomplete exemplification of its leading processes
Here were summed up and stated with the most solemn earnestness the
conclusions to which long study and continual familiarity with the
matters in question had led him And with the Novum Organum was at
length disclosed though only in outline the whole of the vast scheme
in all its parts object method materials results for the
Instauration of human knowledge the restoration of powers lost
disused neglected latent but recoverable by honesty patience
courage and industry

     The Instauratio as he planned the work is to be divided says
     Mr Ellis into six portions of which the first is to contain a
     general survey of the present state of knowledge In the second
     men are to be taught how to use their understanding aright in the
     investigation of nature In the third all the phenomena of the
     universe are to be stored up as in a treasure-house as the
     materials on which the new method is to be employed In the
     fourth examples are to be given of its operation and of the
     results to which it leads The fifth is to contain what Bacon had
     accomplished in natural philosophy without the aid of his own
     method ex eodem intellectûs usu quem alii in inquirendo et
     inveniendo adhibere consueverunt It is therefore less important
     than the rest and Bacon declares that he will not bind himself to
     the conclusions which it contains Moreover its value will
     altogether cease when the sixth part can be completed wherein
     will be set forth the new philosophy the results of the
     application of the new method to all the phenomena of the universe
     But to complete this the last part of the Instauratio Bacon
     does not hope he speaks of it as a thing et supra vires et ultra
     spes nostras collocata Works i   

The Novum Organum itself imperfect was the crown of all that he
lived to do It was followed      by the publication intended to be
periodical of materials for the new philosophy to work upon particular
sections and classes of observations on phenomena the History of the
Winds the History of Life and Death Others were partly prepared but
not published by him And finally in      he brought out in Latin a
greatly enlarged recasting of the Advancement the nine books of the
De Augmentis But the great scheme was not completed portions were
left more or less finished Much that he purposed was left undone and
could not have been yet done at that time

But the works which he published represent imperfectly the labour spent
on the undertaking Besides these there remains a vast amount of unused
or rejected work which shows how it was thought out rearranged tried
first in one fashion and then in another recast developed Separate
chapters introductions experimental essays and discarded beginnings
treatises with picturesque and imaginative titles succeeded one another
in that busy work-shop and these first drafts and tentative essays have
in them some of the freshest and most felicitous forms of his thoughts
At one time his enterprise connecting itself with his own life and
mission rose before his imagination and kindled his feelings and
embodied itself in the lofty and stately Proem already quoted His
quick and brilliant imagination saw shadows and figures of his ideas in
the ancient mythology which he worked out with curious ingenuity and
often much poetry in his Wisdom of the Ancients Towards the end of
his life he began to embody his thoughts and plans in a philosophical
tale which he did not finish the New Atlantis a charming example of
his graceful fancy and of his power of easy and natural story-telling
Between the Advancement and the Novum Organum     -   much
underground work had been done He had finally about      settled the
plan of the Great Instauration and began to call it by that name
The plan first in three or four divisions had been finally digested
into six Vague outlines had become definite and clear Distinct
portions had been worked out Various modes of treatment had been tried
abandoned modified Prefaces were written to give the sketch and
purpose of chapters not yet composed The Novum Organum had been
written and rewritten twelve times over Bacon kept his papers and we
can trace in the unused portion of those left behind him much of the
progress of his work and the shapes which much of it went through The
Advancement itself is the filling-out and perfecting of what is found
in germ meagre and rudimentary in a Discourse in Praise of
Knowledge written in the days of Elizabeth and in some Latin chapters
of an early date the Cogitationes de Scientia Humana on the limits
and use of knowledge and on the relation of natural history to natural
philosophy These early essays with much of the same characteristic
illustration and many of the favourite images and maxims and texts and
phrases which continue to appear in his writings to the end contain
the thoughts of a man long accustomed to meditate and to see his way on
the new aspects of knowledge opening upon him And before the
Advancement he had already tried his hand on a work intended to be in
two books which Mr Ellis describes as a great work on the
Interpretation of Nature the earliest type of the Instauratio and
which Bacon called by the enigmatical name of Valerius Terminus In
it as in a second draft which in its turn was superseded by the
Advancement the line of thought of the Latin Cogitationes
reappears expanded and more carefully ordered it contains also the
first sketch of his certain and infallible method for what he calls the
freeing of the direction in the search after Truth and the first
indications of the four classes of Idols which were to be so memorable
a portion of Bacon's teaching And between the Advancement and the
Novum Organum at least one unpublished treatise of great interest
intervened the Visa et Cogitata on which he was long employed and
which he brought to a finished shape fit to be submitted to his friends
and critics Sir Thomas Bodley and Bishop Andrewes It is spoken of as
a book to be imparted sicut videbitur in the review which he made
of his life and objects soon after he was made Solicitor in      A
number of fragments also bear witness to the fierce scorn and wrath
which possessed him against the older and the received philosophies He
tried his hand at declamatory onslaughts on the leaders of human wisdom
from the early Greeks and Aristotle down to the latest novellists and
he certainly succeeded in being magnificently abusive But he thought
wisely that this was not the best way of doing what in the Commentarius
Solutus he calls on himself to do taking a greater confidence and
authority in discourses of this nature tanquam sui certus et de alto
despiciens and the rhetorical Redargutio Philosophiarum and
writings of kindred nature were laid aside by his more serious judgment
But all these fragments witness to the immense and unwearied labour
bestowed in the midst of a busy life on his undertaking they suggest
too the suspicion that there was much waste from interruption and the
doubt whether his work would not have been better if it could have been
more steadily continuous But if ever a man had a great object in life
and pursued it through good and evil report through ardent hope and
keen disappointment to the end with unwearied patience and unshaken
faith it was Bacon when he sought the improvement of human knowledge
for the glory of God and the relief of man's estate It is not the
least part of the pathetic fortune of his life that his own success was
so imperfect

When a reader first comes from the vague popular notions of Bacon's
work to his definite proposals the effect is startling Every one has
heard that he contemplated a complete reform of the existing conceptions
of human knowledge and of the methods by which knowledge was to be
sought that rejecting them as vitiated by the loose and untested way
in which they had been formed he called men from verbal generalisations
and unproved assumptions to come down face to face with the realities of
experience that he substituted for formal reasoning from baseless
premises and unmeaning principles a methodical system of cautious and
sifting inference from wide observation and experiment and that he thus
opened the path which modern science thenceforth followed with its
amazing and unexhausted discoveries and its vast and beneficent
practical results We credit all this to Bacon and assuredly not
without reason All this is what was embraced in his vision of a changed
world of thought and achievement All this is what was meant by that
Regnum Hominis which with a play on sacred words which his age did
not shrink from and which he especially pleased himself with marked
the coming of that hitherto unimagined empire of man over the powers and
forces which encompassed him But the detail of all this is multifarious
and complicated and is not always what we expect and when we come to
see how his work is estimated by those who by greatest familiarity with
scientific ideas and the history of scientific inquiries are best
fitted to judge of it many a surprise awaits us

For we find that the greatest differences of opinion exist on the value
of what he did Not only very unfavourable judgments have been passed
upon it on general grounds as an irreligious or a shallow and
one-sided or a poor and utilitarian philosophy and on a definite
comparison of it with the actual methods and processes which as a matter
of history have been the real means of scientific discovery but also
some of those who have most admired his genius and with the deepest
love and reverence have spared no pains to do it full justice have yet
come to the conclusion that as an instrument and real method of work
Bacon's attempt was a failure It is not only De Maistre and Lord
Macaulay who dispute his philosophical eminence It is not only the
depreciating opinion of a contemporary like Harvey who was actually
doing what Bacon was writing about It is not only that men who after
the long history of modern science have won their place among its
leaders and are familiar by daily experience with the ways in which it
works a chemist like Liebig a physiologist like Claude Bernard say
that they can find nothing to help them in Bacon's methods It is not
only that a clear and exact critic like M de Rémusat looks at his
attempt with its success and failure as characteristic of English
massive practical good sense rather than as marked by real
philosophical depth and refinement such as Continental thinkers point
to and are proud of in Descartes and Leibnitz It is not even that a
competent master of the whole domain of knowledge Whewell filled with
the deepest sense of all that the world owes to Bacon takes for granted
that though Bacon's general maxims are sagacious and animating his
particular precepts failed in his hands and are now practically
useless and assuming that Bacon's method is not the right one and not
complete as far as the progress of science up to his time could direct
it proceeds to construct a Novum Organum Renovatum But Bacon's
writings have recently undergone the closest examination by two editors
whose care for his memory is as loyal and affectionate as their capacity
is undoubted and their willingness to take trouble boundless And Mr
Ellis and Mr Spedding with all their interest in every detail of
Bacon's work and admiration of the way in which he performed it make
no secret of their conclusion that he failed in the very thing on which
he was most bent the discovery of practical and fruitful ways of
scientific inquiry Bacon says Mr Spedding failed to devise a
practicable method for the discovery of the Forms of Nature because he
misconceived the conditions of the case For the same reason he
failed to make any single discovery which holds its place as one of the
steps by which science has in any direction really advanced The clew
with which he entered the labyrinth did not reach far enough before he
had nearly attained his end he was obliged either to come back or to go
on without it

     His peculiar system of philosophy says Mr Spedding in another
     preface that is to say the peculiar method of investigation the
     organum the formula the clavis the ars ipsa
     interpretandi naturam the filum Labyrinthi or by whatever
     of its many names we choose to call that artificial process by
     which alone he believed man could attain a knowledge of the laws
     and a command over the powers of nature of this philosophy we can
     make nothing If we have not tried it it is because we feel
     confident that it would not answer We regard it as a curious piece
     of machinery very subtle elaborate and ingenious but not worth
     constructing because all the work it could do may be done more
     easily another way Works iii    

What his method really was is itself a matter of question Mr Ellis
speaks of it as a matter but imperfectly apprehended He differs from
his fellow-labourer Mr Spedding in what he supposes to be its central
and characteristic innovation Mr Ellis finds it in an improvement and
perfection of logical machinery Mr Spedding finds it in the formation
of a great natural and experimental history a vast collection of
facts in every department of nature which was to be a more important
part of his philosophy than the Novum Organum itself Both of them
think that as he went on the difficulties of the work grew upon him
and caused alterations in his plans and we are reminded that there is
no didactic exposition of his method in the whole of his writings and
that this has not been sufficiently remarked by those who have spoken
of his philosophy

In the first place the kind of intellectual instrument which he
proposed to construct was a mistake His great object was to place the
human mind on a level with things and nature ut faciamus intellectum
humanum rebus et naturæ parem and this could only be done by a
revolution in methods The ancients had all that genius could do for
man but it was a matter he said not of the strength and fleetness of
the running but of the rightness of the way It was a new method
absolutely different from anything known which he proposed to the
world and which should lead men to knowledge with the certainty and
with the impartial facility of a high-road The Induction which he
imagined to himself as the contrast to all that had yet been tried was
to have two qualities It was to end by no very prolonged or difficult
processes in absolute certainty And next it was to leave very little
to the differences of intellectual power it was to level minds and
capacities It was to give all men the same sort of power which a pair
of compasses gives the hand in drawing a circle Absolute certainty
and a mechanical mode of procedure says Mr Ellis such that all men
should be capable of employing it are the two great features of the
Baconian system This he thought possible and this he set himself to
expound a method universally applicable and in all cases infallible
In this he saw the novelty and the vast importance of his discovery By
this method all the knowledge which the human mind was capable of
receiving might be attained and attained without unnecessary labour
It was a method of a demonstrative character with the power of
reducing all minds to nearly the same level The conception indeed of
a great Art of knowledge of an Instauration of the sciences of a
Clavis which should unlock the difficulties which had hindered
discovery was not a new one This attempt at a method which should be
certain which should level capacities which should do its work in a
short time had a special attraction for the imagination of the wild
spirits of the South from Raimond Lulli in the thirteenth century to
the audacious Calabrians of the sixteenth With Bacon it was something
much more serious and reasonable and business-like But such a claim has
never yet been verified there is no reason to think that it ever can
be and to have made it shows a fundamental defect in Bacon's conception
of the possibilities of the human mind and the field it has to work in

In the next place though the prominence which he gave to the doctrine
of Induction was one of those novelties which are so obvious after the
event though so strange before it and was undoubtedly the element in
his system which gave it life and power and influence on the course of
human thought and discovery his account of Induction was far from
complete and satisfactory Without troubling himself about the theory of
Induction as De Rémusat has pointed out he contented himself with
applying to its use the precepts of common-sense and a sagacious
perception of the circumstances in which it was to be employed But even
these precepts notable as they were wanted distinctness and the
qualities needed for working rules The change is great when in fifty
years we pass from the poetical science of Bacon to the mathematical and
precise science of Newton His own time may well have been struck by
the originality and comprehensiveness of such a discriminating
arrangement of proofs as the Prerogative Instances of the Novum
Organum so natural and real yet never before thus compared and
systematized But there is a great interval between his method of
experimenting his Hunt of Pan the three tables of Instances
Presence Absence and Degrees or Comparisons leading to a
process of sifting and exclusion and to the First Vintage or
beginnings of theory and say for instance Mill's four methods of
experimental inquiry the method of agreement of differences of
residues and of concomitant variations The course which he marked
out so laboriously and so ingeniously for Induction to follow was one
which was found to be impracticable and as barren of results as those
deductive philosophies on which he lavished his scorn He has left
precepts and examples of what he meant by his cross-examining and
sifting processes As admonitions to cross-examine and to sift facts and
phenomena they are valuable Many of the observations and
classifications are subtle and instructive But in his hands nothing
comes of them They lead at the utmost to mere negative conclusions
they show what a thing is not But his attempt to elicit anything
positive out of them breaks down or ends at best in divinations and
guesses sometimes as in connecting Heat and Motion very near to later
and more carefully-grounded theories but always unverified He had a
radically false and mechanical conception though in words he earnestly
disclaims it of the way to deal with the facts of nature He looked on
them as things which told their own story and suggested the questions
which ought to be put to them and with this idea half his time was
spent in collecting huge masses of indigested facts of the most various
authenticity and value and he thought he was collecting materials
which his method had only to touch in order to bring forth from them
light and truth and power He thought that not in certain sciences but
in all one set of men could do the observing and collecting and
another be set on the work of Induction and the discovery of axioms
Doubtless in the arrangement and sorting of them his versatile and
ingenious mind gave itself full play he divides and distinguishes them
into their companies and groups different kinds of Motion
Prerogative instances with their long tale of imaginative titles But
we look in vain for any use that he was able to make of them or even to
suggest Bacon never adequately realised that no promiscuous assemblage
of even the most certain facts could ever lead to knowledge could ever
suggest their own interpretation without the action on them of the
living mind without the initiative of an idea In truth he was so
afraid of assumptions and anticipations and prejudices his great
bugbear was so much the intellectus sibi permissus the mind given
liberty to guess and imagine and theorise instead of as it ought
absolutely and servilely submitting itself to the control of facts that
he missed the true place of the rational and formative element in his
account of Induction He does tell us indeed that truth emerges
sooner from error than from confusion He indulges the mind in the
course of its investigation of Instances with a first vintage of
provisional generalisations But of the way in which the living mind of
the discoverer works with its ideas and insight and thoughts that come
no one knows whence working hand in hand with what comes before the eye
or is tested by the instrument he gives us no picture Compare his
elaborate investigation of the Form of Heat in the Novum Organum
with such a record of real inquiry as Wells's Treatise on Dew or
Herschel's analysis of it in his Introduction to Natural Philosophy
And of the difference of genius between a Faraday or a Newton and the
crowd of average men who have used and finished off their work he takes
no account Indeed he thinks that for the future such difference is to
disappear

     That his method is impracticable says Mr Ellis cannot I
     think be denied if we reflect not only that it never has produced
     any result but also that the process by which scientific truths
     have been established cannot be so presented as even to appear to
     be in accordance with it In all cases this process involves an
     element to which nothing corresponds in the Tables of 'Comparence'
     and 'Exclusion' namely the application to the facts of
     observation of a principle of arrangement an idea existing in the
     mind of the discoverer antecedently to the act of induction It may
     be said that this idea is precisely one of the naturæ into which
     the facts of observation ought in Bacon's system to be analysed
     And this is in one sense true but it must be added that this
     analysis if it be thought right so to call it is of the essence
     of the discovery which results from it In most cases the act of
     induction follows as a matter of course as soon as the appropriate
     idea has been introduced Ellis General Preface i   

Lastly not only was Bacon's conception of philosophy so narrow as to
exclude one of its greatest domains for says Mr Ellis it cannot be
denied that to Bacon all sound philosophy seemed to be included in what
we now call the natural sciences and in all its parts was claimed as
the subject of his inductive method but Bacon's scientific knowledge
and scientific conceptions were often very imperfect more imperfect
than they ought to have been for his time Of one large part of science
which was just then beginning to be cultivated with high promise of
success the knowledge of the heavens he speaks with a coldness and
suspicion which contrasts remarkably with his eagerness about things
belonging to the sphere of the earth and within reach of the senses He
holds of course the unity of the world the laws of the whole visible
universe are one order but the heavens wonderful as they are to him
are compared with other things out of his track of inquiry He had his
astronomical theories he expounded them in his Descriptio Globi
Intellectualis and his Thema Coeli He was not altogether ignorant of
what was going on in days when Copernicus Kepler and Galileo were at
work But he did not know how to deal with it and there were men in
England before and then who understood much better than he the
problems and the methods of astronomy He had one conspicuous and
strange defect for a man who undertook what he did He was not a
mathematician he did not see the indispensable necessity of mathematics
in the great Instauration which he projected he did not much believe
in what they could do He cared so little about them that he takes no
notice of Napier's invention of Logarithms He was not able to trace how
the direct information of the senses might be rightly subordinated to
the rational but not self-evident results of geometry and arithmetic
He was impatient of the subtleties of astronomical calculations they
only attempted to satisfy problems about the motion of bodies in the
sky and told us nothing of physical fact they gave us as Prometheus
gave to Jove the outside skin of the offering which was stuffed inside
with straw and rubbish He entirely failed to see that before dealing
with physical astronomy it must be dealt with mathematically It is
well to remark as Mr Ellis says that none of Newton's astronomical
discoveries could have been made if astronomers had not continued to
render themselves liable to Bacon's censure Bacon little thought that
in navigation the compass itself would become a subordinate instrument
compared with the helps given by mathematical astronomy In this and in
other ways Bacon rose above his time in his conceptions of what might
be but not of what was the list is a long one as given by Mr
Spedding iii     of the instances which show that he was
ill-informed about the advances of knowledge in his own time And his
mind was often not clear when he came to deal with complex phenomena
Thus though he constructed a table of specific gravities the only
collection says Mr Ellis of quantitative experiments that we find
in his works and wonderfully accurate considering the manner in which
they were obtained yet he failed to understand the real nature of the
famous experiment of Archimedes And so with the larger features of his
teaching it is impossible not to feel how imperfectly he had emancipated
himself from the power of words and of common prepossessions how for
one reason or another he had failed to call himself to account in the
terms he employed and the assumptions on which he argued The caution
does not seem to have occurred to him that the statement of a fact may
in nine cases out of ten involve a theory His whole doctrine of
Forms and Simple natures which is so prominent in his method of
investigation is an example of loose and slovenly use of unexamined and
untested ideas He allowed himself to think that it would be possible to
arrive at an alphabet of nature which once attained would suffice to
spell out and constitute all its infinite combinations He accepted
without thinking it worth a doubt the doctrine of appetites and
passions and inclinations and dislikes and horrors in inorganic nature
His whole physiology of life and death depends on a doctrine of animal
spirits of which he traces the operations and qualities as if they were
as certain as the nerves or the blood and of which he gives this
account that in every tangible body there is a spirit covered and
enveloped in the grosser body not a virtue not an energy not an
actuality nor any such idle matter but a body thin and invisible and
yet having place and dimension and real  a middle nature between
flame which is momentary and air which is permanent Yet these are
the very things for which he holds up Aristotle and the Scholastics and
the Italian speculators to reprobation and scorn The clearness of his
thinking was often overlaid by the immense profusion of decorative
material which his meditation brought along with it The defect was
greater than that which even his ablest defenders admit It was more
than that in that greatest and radical difference which he himself
observes between minds the difference between minds which were apt to
note distinctions and those which were apt to note likenesses he
was without knowing it defective in the first It was that in many
instances he exemplified in his own work the very faults which he
charged on the older philosophies haste carelessness precipitancy
using words without thinking them out assuming to know when he ought to
have perceived his real ignorance

What then with all these mistakes and failures not always creditable
or pardonable has given Bacon his preeminent place in the history of
science

  The answer is that with all his mistakes and failures the principles
on which his mode of attaining a knowledge of nature was based were the
only true ones and they had never before been propounded so
systematically so fully and so earnestly His was not the first mind
on whom these principles had broken Men were and had been for some
time pursuing their inquiries into various departments of nature
precisely on the general plan of careful and honest observation of real
things which he enjoined They had seen as he saw the futility of all
attempts at natural philosophy by mere thinking and arguing without
coming into contact with the contradictions or corrections or
verifications of experience In Italy in Germany in England there were
laborious and successful workers who had long felt that to be in touch
with nature was the only way to know But no one had yet come before the
world to proclaim this on the house-tops as the key of the only certain
path to the secrets of nature the watchword of a revolution in the
methods of interpreting her and this Bacon did with an imposing
authority and power which enforced attention He spoke the thoughts of
patient toilers like Harvey with a largeness and richness which they
could not command and which they perhaps smiled at He disentangled and
spoke the vague thoughts of his age which other men had not the courage
and clearness of mind to formulate What Bacon did indeed and what
he meant are separate matters He meant an infallible method by
which man should be fully equipped for a struggle with nature he meant
an irresistible and immediate conquest within a definite and not
distant time It was too much He himself saw no more of what he meant
than Columbus did of America But what he did was to persuade men for
the future that the intelligent patient persevering cross-examination
of things and the thoughts about them was the only and was the
successful road to know No one had yet done this and he did it His
writings were a public recognition of real science in its humblest
tasks about the commonplace facts before our feet as well as in its
loftiest achievements The man who is growing great and happy by
electrifying a bottle says Dr Johnson wonders to see the world
engaged in the prattle about peace and war and the world was ready to
smile at the simplicity or the impertinence of his enthusiasm Bacon
impressed upon the world for good with every resource of subtle
observation and forcible statement that the man who is growing great
by electrifying a bottle is as important a person in the world's
affairs as the arbiter of peace and war

  Yet this is not all An inferior man might have made himself the
mouthpiece of the hopes and aspirations of his generation after a larger
science But to Bacon these aspirations embodied themselves in the form
of a great and absorbing idea an idea which took possession of the
whole man kindling in him a faith which nothing could quench and a
passion which nothing could dull an idea which for forty years was
his daily companion his daily delight his daily business an idea
which he was never tired of placing in ever fresh and more attractive
lights from which no trouble could wean him about which no disaster
could make him despair an idea round which the instincts and intuitions
and obstinate convictions of genius gathered which kindled his rich
imagination and was invested by it with a splendour and magnificence
like the dreams of fable It is this idea which finds its fitting
expression in the grand and stately aphorisms of the Novum Organum in
the varied fields of interest in the De Augmentis in the romance of
the New Atlantis It is this idea this certainty of a new unexplored
Kingdom of Knowledge within the reach and grasp of man if he will be
humble enough and patient enough and truthful enough to occupy it this
announcement not only of a new system of thought but of a change in the
condition of the world a prize and possession such as man had not yet
imagined this belief in the fortunes of the human race and its issue
such an issue it may be as in the present condition of things and
men's minds cannot easily be conceived or imagined yet more than
verified in the wonders which our eyes have seen it is this which gives
its prerogative to Bacon's work That he bungled about the processes of
Induction that he talked about an unintelligible doctrine of Forms
did not affect the weight and solemnity of his call to learn so full of
wisdom and good-sense so sober and so solid yet so audaciously
confident There had been nothing like it in its ardour of hope in the
glory which it threw around the investigation of nature It was the
presence and the power of a great idea long become a commonplace to us
but strange and perplexing at first to his own generation which
probably shared Coke's opinion that it qualified its champion for a
place in the company of the Ship of Fools which expressed its opinion
of the man who wrote the Novum Organum in the sentiment that a fool
could not have written it and a wise man would not it is this
which has placed Bacon among the great discoverers of the human race

It is this imaginative yet serious assertion of the vast range and
possibilities of human knowledge which as M de Rémusat remarks the
keenest and fairest of Bacon's judges gives Bacon his claim to the
undefinable but very real character of greatness Two men stand out
the masters of those who know without equals up to their time among
men the Greek Aristotle and the Englishman Bacon They agree in the
universality and comprehensiveness of their conception of human
knowledge and they were absolutely alone in their serious practical
ambition to work out this conception In the separate departments of
thought of investigation of art each is left far behind by numbers of
men who in these separate departments have gone far deeper than they
have soared higher have been more successful in what they attempted
But Aristotle first and for his time more successfully and Bacon after
him ventured on the daring enterprise of taking all knowledge for
their province and in this they stood alone This present scene of
man's existence this that we call nature the stage on which mortal
life begins and goes on and ends the faculties with which man is
equipped to act to enjoy to create to hold his way amid or against
the circumstances and forces round him this is what each wants to know
as thoroughly and really as can be It is not to reduce things to a
theory or a system that they look around them on the place where they
find themselves with life and thought and power that were easily done
and has been done over and over again only to prove its futility It is
to know as to the whole and its parts as men understand knowing in
some one subject of successful handling whether art or science or
practical craft This idea this effort distinguishes these two men
The Greeks predecessors contemporaries successors of Aristotle were
speculators full of clever and ingenious guesses in which the amount
of clear and certain fact was in lamentable disproportion to the schemes
blown up from it or they devoted themselves more profitably to some one
or two subjects of inquiry moral or purely intellectual with absolute
indifference to what might be asked or what might be known of the real
conditions under which they were passing their existence Some of the
Romans Cicero and Pliny had encyclopædic minds but the Roman mind
was the slave of precedent and was more than satisfied with partially
understanding and neatly arranging what the Greeks had left The
Arabians looked more widely about them but the Arabians were
essentially sceptics and resigned subjects to the inevitable and the
inexplicable there was an irony open or covert in their philosophy
their terminology their transcendental mysticism which showed how
little they believed that they really knew The vast and mighty
intellects of the schoolmen never came into a real grapple with the
immensity of the facts of the natural or even of the moral world within
the world of abstract thought the world of language with its infinite
growths and consequences they have never had their match for keenness
for patience for courage for inexhaustible toil but they were as much
disconnected from the natural world which was their stage of life as
if they had been disembodied spirits The Renaissance brought with it
not only the desire to know but to know comprehensively and in all
possible directions it brought with it temptations to the awakened
Italian genius renewed enlarged refined if not strengthened by its
passage through the Middle Ages to make thought deal with the real and
to understand the scene in which men were doing such strange and
wonderful things but Giordano Bruno Telesio Campanella and their
fellows were not men capable of more than short flights though they
might be daring and eager ones It required more thoroughness more
humble-minded industry to match the magnitude of the task And there
have been men of universal minds and comprehensive knowledge since
Bacon Leibnitz Goethe Humboldt men whose thoughts were at home
everywhere where there was something to be known But even for them the
world of knowledge has grown too large We shall never again see an
Aristotle or a Bacon because the conditions of knowledge have altered
Bacon like Aristotle belonged to an age of adventure which went to
sea little knowing whither it went and ill furnished with knowledge and
instruments He entered with a vast and vague scheme of discovery on
these unknown seas and new worlds which to us are familiar and daily
traversed in every direction This new world of knowledge has turned out
in many ways very different from what Aristotle or Bacon supposed and
has been conquered by implements and weapons very different in precision
and power from what they purposed to rely on But the combination of
patient and careful industry with the courage and divination of genius
in doing what none had done before makes it equally stupid and idle to
impeach their greatness

  Bacon has been charged with bringing philosophy down from the
heights not as of old to make men know themselves and to be the
teacher of the highest form of truth but to be the purveyor of material
utility It contemplates only it is said the commoda vitæ about
the deeper and more elevating problems of thought it does not trouble
itself It concerns itself only about external and sensible nature
about what is of the earth earthy But when it comes to the questions
which have attracted the keenest and hardiest thinkers the question
what it is that thinks and wills what is the origin and guarantee of
the faculties by which men know anything at all and form rational and
true conceptions about nature and themselves whence it is that reason
draws its powers and materials and rules what is the meaning of words
which all use but few can explain Time and Space and Being and Cause
and consciousness and choice and the moral law Bacon is content with a
loose and superficial treatment of them Bacon certainly was not a
metaphysician nor an exact and lucid reasoner With wonderful flashes
of sure intuition or happy anticipation his mind was deficient in the
powers which deal with the deeper problems of thought just as it was
deficient in the mathematical faculty The subtlety the intuition the
penetration the severe precision even the force of imagination which
make a man a great thinker on any abstract subject were not his the
interest of questions which had interested metaphysicians had no
interest for him he distrusted and undervalued them When he touches
the ultimities of knowledge he is as obscure and hard to be understood
as any of those restless Southern Italians of his own age who shared
with him the ambition of reconstructing science Certainly the science
which most interested Bacon the science which he found as he thought
in so desperate a condition and to which he gave so great an impulse
was physical science But physical science may be looked at and pursued
in different ways in different tempers with different objects It may
be followed in the spirit of Newton of Boyle of Herschel of Faraday
or with a confined and low horizon it may be dwarfed and shrivelled into
a mean utilitarianism But Bacon's horizon was not a narrow one He
believed in God and immortality and the Christian creed and hope To him
the restoration of the Reign of Man was a noble enterprise because man
was so great and belonged to so great an order of things because the
things which he was bid to search into with honesty and truthfulness
were the works and laws of God because it was so shameful and so
miserable that from an ignorance which industry and good-sense could
remedy the tribes of mankind passed their days in self-imposed darkness
and helplessness It was God's appointment that men should go through
this earthly stage of their being Each stage of man's mysterious
existence had to be dealt with not according to his own fancies but
according to the conditions imposed on it and it was one of man's first
duties to arrange for his stay on earth according to the real laws which
he could find out if he only sought for them Doubtless it was one of
Bacon's highest hopes that from the growth of true knowledge would
follow in surprising ways the relief of man's estate this as an end
runs through all his yearning after a fuller and surer method of
interpreting nature The desire to be a great benefactor the spirit of
sympathy and pity for mankind reign through this portion of his
work pity for confidence so greatly abused by the teachers of man pity
for ignorance which might be dispelled pity for pain and misery which
might be relieved In the quaint but beautiful picture of courtesy
kindness and wisdom which he imagines in the New Atlantis the
representative of true philosophy the Father of Solomon's House is
introduced as one who had an aspect as if he pitied men But unless it
is utilitarianism to be keenly alive to the needs and pains of life and
to be eager and busy to lighten and assuage them Bacon's philosophy was
not utilitarian It may deserve many reproaches but not this one Such
a passage as the following in which are combined the highest motives
and graces and passions of the soul love of truth humility of mind
purity of purpose reverence for God sympathy for man compassion for
the sorrows of the world and longing to heal them depth of conviction
and faith fairly represents the spirit which runs through his works
After urging the mistaken use of imagination and authority in science
he goes on 

     There is not and never will be an end or limit to this one
     catches at one thing another at another each has his favourite
     fancy pure and open light there is none every one philosophises
     out of the cells of his own imagination as out of Plato's cave
     the higher wits with more acuteness and felicity the duller less
     happily but with equal pertinacity And now of late by the
     regulation of some learned and as things now are excellent men
     the former license having I suppose become wearisome the
     sciences are confined to certain and prescribed authors and thus
     restrained are imposed upon the old and instilled into the young
     so that now to use the sarcasm of Cicero concerning Cæsar's year
     the constellation of Lyra rises by edict and authority is taken
     for truth not truth for authority Which kind of institution and
     discipline is excellent for present use but precludes all prospect
     of improvement For we copy the sin of our first parents while we
     suffer for it They wished to be like God but their posterity wish
     to be even greater For we create worlds we direct and domineer
     over nature we will have it that all things are as in our folly
     we think they should be not as seems fittest to the Divine wisdom
     or as they are found to be in fact and I know not whether we more
     distort the facts of nature or of our own wits but we clearly
     impress the stamp of our own image on the creatures and works of
     God instead of carefully examining and recognising in them the
     stamp of the Creator himself Wherefore our dominion over creatures
     is a second time forfeited not undeservedly and whereas after the
     fall of man some power over the resistance of creatures was still
     left to him the power of subduing and managing them by true and
     solid arts yet this too through our insolence and because we
     desire to be like God and to follow the dictates of our own reason
     we in great part lose If therefore there be any humility towards
     the Creator any reverence for or disposition to magnify His works
     any charity for man and anxiety to relieve his sorrows and
     necessities any love of truth in nature any hatred of darkness
     any desire for the purification of the understanding we must
     entreat men again and again to discard or at least set apart for a
     while these volatile and preposterous philosophies which have
     preferred theses to hypotheses led experience captive and
     triumphed over the works of God and to approach with humility and
     veneration to unroll the volume of Creation to linger and meditate
     therein and with minds washed clean from opinions to study it in
     purity and integrity For this is that sound and language which
     went forth into all lands and did not incur the confusion of
     Babel this should men study to be perfect in and becoming again
     as little children condescend to take the alphabet of it into their
     hands and spare no pains to search and unravel the interpretation
     thereof but pursue it strenuously and persevere even unto
     death Preface to Historia Naturalis translated Works v

CHAPTER IX

BACON AS A WRITER


Bacon's name belongs to letters as well as to philosophy In his own
day whatever his contemporaries thought of his Instauration of
Knowledge he was in the first rank as a speaker and a writer Sir
Walter Raleigh contrasting him with Salisbury who could speak but not
write and Northampton who could write but not speak thought Bacon
eminent both as a speaker and a writer Ben Jonson passing in review
the more famous names of his own and the preceding age from Sir Thomas
More to Sir Philip Sidney Hooker Essex and Raleigh places Bacon
without a rival at the head of the company as the man who had fulfilled
all numbers and stood as the mark and Greek akmê of our language
And he also records Bacon's power as a speaker No man he says ever
spoke more neatly more pressly or suffered less emptiness less
idleness in what he utteredHis hearers could not cough or look
aside from him without loss He commanded when he spoke and had his
judges angry and pleased at his devotion  the fear of every man that
heard him was that he should make an end He notices one feature for
which we are less prepared though we know that the edge of Bacon's
sarcastic tongue was felt and resented in James's Court His speech
says Ben Jonson was nobly censorious when he could spare and pass by
a jest The unpopularity which certainly seems to have gathered round
his name may have had something to do with this reputation

Yet as an English writer Bacon did not expect to be remembered and he
hardly cared to be He wrote much in Latin and his first care was to
have his books put into a Latin dress For these modern languages he
wrote to Toby Matthews towards the close of his life will at one time
or another play the bank-rowte with books and since I have lost much
time with this age I would be glad if God would give me leave to
recover it with posterity He wanted to be read by the learned out of
England who were supposed to appreciate his philosophical ideas better
than his own countrymen and the only way to this was to have his books
translated into the general language He sends Prince Charles the
Advancement in its new Latin dress It is a book he says that
will live and be a citizen of the world as English books are not And
he fitted it for continental reading by carefully weeding it of all
passages that might give offence to the censors at Rome or Paris I
have been he writes to the King mine own Index Expurgatorius that
it may be read in all places For since my end of putting it in Latin
was to have it read everywhere it had been an absurd contradiction to
free it in the language and to pen it up in the matter Even the
Essays and the History of Henry VII he had put into Latin by some
good pens that do not forsake me Among these translators are said to
have been George Herbert and Hobbes and on more doubtful authority Ben
Jonson and Selden The Essays were also translated into Latin and
Italian with Bacon's sanction

Bacon's contemptuous and hopeless estimate of these modern languages
forty years after Spenser had proclaimed and justified his faith in his
own language is only one of the proofs of the short-sightedness of the
wisest and the limitations of the largest-minded Perhaps we ought not
to wonder at his silence about Shakespeare It was the fashion except
among a set of clever but not always very reputable people to think the
stage as it was below the notice of scholars and statesmen and
Shakespeare took no trouble to save his works from neglect Yet it is a
curious defect in Bacon that he should not have been more alive to the
powers and future of his own language He early and all along was
profoundly impressed with the contrast which the scholarship of the age
so abundantly presented of words to things He dwells in the
Advancement on that first distemper of learning when men study words
and not matter He illustrates it at large from the reaction of the new
learning and of the popular teaching of the Reformation against the
utilitarian and unclassical terminology of the schoolmen a reaction
which soon grew to excess and made men hunt more after choiceness of
the phrase and the round and clean composition of the sentence and the
sweet falling of the clauses than after worth of subject soundness of
argument life of invention or depth of judgment I have represented
this he says in an example of late times but it hath been and will
be secundum majus et minus in all times and he likens this vanity
to Pygmalion's frenzy for to fall in love with words which are but
the images of matter is all one as to fall in love with a picture He
was dissatisfied with the first attempt at translation into Latin of the
Advancement by Dr Playfer of Cambridge because he desired not so
much neat and polite as clear masculine and apt expression Yet
with this hatred of circumlocution and prettiness of the cloudy
amplifications and pompous flourishings and the flowing and watery
vein which the scholars of his time affected it is strange that he
should not have seen that the new ideas and widening thoughts of which
he was the herald would want a much more elastic and more freely-working
instrument than Latin could ever become It is wonderful indeed what can
be done with Latin It was long after his day to be the language of the
exact sciences In his History of the Winds which is full of his
irrepressible fancy and picturesqueness Bacon describes in clear and
intelligible Latin the details of the rigging of a modern man-of-war
and the mode of sailing her But such tasks impose a yoke sometimes a
rough one on a language which has taken its ply in very different
conditions and of which the genius is that of indirect and circuitous
expression full of majesty and circumstance But it never even in
those days of scholarship could lend itself to the frankness the
straightforwardness the fulness and shades of suggestion and
association with which in handling ideas of subtlety and difficulty a
writer would wish to speak to his reader and which he could find only
in his mother tongue It might have been thought that with Bacon's
contempt of form and ceremony in these matters his consciousness of the
powers of English in his hands might have led him to anticipate that a
flexible and rich and strong language might create a literature and
that a literature if worth studying would be studied in its own
language But so great a change was beyond even his daring thoughts To
him as to his age the only safe language was the Latin For familiar
use English was well enough But it could not be trusted it would play
the bankrupt with books And yet Galileo was writing in Italian as well
as in Latin only within twenty-five years later Descartes was writing
De la Méthode and Pascal was writing in the same French in which he
wrote the Provincial Letters his Nouvelles Expériences touchant le
Vide and the controversial pamphlets which followed it showing how in
that interval of five-and-twenty years an instrument had been fashioned
out of a modern language such as for lucid expression and clear
reasoning Bacon had not yet dreamed of From Bacon to Pascal is the
change from the old scientific way of writing to the modern from a
modern language as learned and used in the   th century to one learned
in the   th

But the language of the age of Elizabeth was a rich and noble one and
it reached a high point in the hands of Bacon In his hands it lent
itself to many uses and assumed many forms and he valued it not
because he thought highly of its qualities as a language but because it
enabled him with least trouble to speak as he would in throwing off
the abundant thoughts that rose within his mind and in going through
the variety of business which could not be done in Latin But in all his
writing it is the matter the real thing that he wanted to say which
was uppermost He cared how it was said not for the sake of form or
ornament but because the force and clearness of what was said depended
so much on how it was said Of course what he wanted to say varied
indefinitely with the various occasions of his life His business may
merely be to write a device or panegyric for a pageant in the Queen's
honour or for the revels of Gray's Inn But even these trifles are the
result of real thought and are full of ideas ideas about the hopes of
knowledge or about the policy of the State and though of course they
have plenty of the flourishes and quaint absurdities indispensable on
such occasions yet the rhetorical affectation is in the thing itself
and not in the way it is handled he had an opportunity of saying some
of the things which were to him of deep and perpetual interest and he
used it to say them as forcibly as strikingly as attractively as he
could His manner of writing depends not on a style or a studied or
acquired habit but on the nature of the task which he has in hand
Everywhere his matter is close to his words and governs animates
informs his words No one in England before had so much as he had the
power to say what he wanted to say and exactly as he wanted to say it
No one was so little at the mercy of conventional language or customary
rhetoric except when he persuaded himself that he had to submit to
those necessities of flattery which cost him at last so dear

The book by which English readers from his own time to ours have known
him best better than by the originality and the eloquence of the
Advancement or than by the political weight and historical
imagination of the History of Henry VII is the first book which he
published the volume of Essays It is an instance of his self-willed
but most skilful use of the freedom and ease which the modern
language which he despised gave him It is obvious that he might have
expanded these Counsels moral and political to the size which such
essays used to swell to after his time Many people would have thanked
him for doing so and some have thought it a good book on which to hang
their own reflections and illustrations But he saw how much could be
done by leaving the beaten track of set treatise and discourse and
setting down unceremoniously the observations which he had made and the
real rules which he had felt to be true on various practical matters
which come home to men's business and bosoms He was very fond of
these moral and political generalisations both of his own collecting
and as found in writers who he thought had the right to make them
like the Latins of the Empire and the Italians and Spaniards of the
Renaissance But a mere string of maxims and quotations would have been
a poor thing and not new and he cast what he had to say into connected
wholes But nothing can be more loose than the structure of the essays
There is no art no style almost except in a few the political
ones no order thoughts are put down and left unsupported unproved
undeveloped In the first form of the ten which composed the first
edition of      they are more like notes of analysis or tables of
contents they are austere even to meagreness But the general character
continues in the enlarged and expanded ones of Bacon's later years They
are like chapters in Aristotle's Ethics and Rhetoric on virtues and
characters only Bacon's takes Aristotle's broad marking lines as drawn
and proceeds with the subtler and more refined observations of a much
longer and wider experience But these short papers say what they have
to say without preface and in literary undress without a superfluous
word without the joints and bands of structure they say it in brief
rapid sentences which come down sentence after sentence like the
strokes of a great hammer No wonder that in their disdainful brevity
they seem rugged and abrupt and do not seem to end but fall But
with their truth and piercingness and delicacy of observation their
roughness gives a kind of flavour which no elaboration could give It is
none the less that their wisdom is of a somewhat cynical kind fully
alive to the slipperiness and self-deceits and faithlessness which are
in the world and rather inclined to be amused at them In some we can
see distinct records of the writer's own experience one contains the
substance of a charge delivered to Judge Hutton on his appointment
another of them is a sketch drawn from life of a character which had
crossed Bacon's path and in the essay on Seeming Wise we can trace
from the impatient notes put down in his Commentarius Solutus the
picture of the man who stood in his way the Attorney-General Hobart
Some of them are memorable oracular utterances not inadequate to the
subject on Truth or Death or Unity Others reveal an utter
incapacity to come near a subject except as a strange external
phenomena like the essay on Love There is a distinct tendency in
them to the Italian school of political and moral wisdom the wisdom of
distrust and of reliance on indirect and roundabout ways There is a
group of them of Delays of Cunning of Wisdom for a Man's
Self of Despatch which show how vigilantly and to what purpose
he had watched the treasurers and secretaries and intriguers of
Elizabeth's and James's Courts and there are curious self-revelations
as in the essay on Friendship But there are also currents of better
and larger feeling such as those which show his own ideal of Great
Place and what he felt of its dangers and duties And mixed with the
fantastic taste and conceits of the time there is evidence in them of
Bacon's keen delight in nature in the beauty and scents of flowers in
the charm of open-air life as in the essay on Gardens The purest of
human pleasures the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man

But he had another manner of writing for what he held to be his more
serious work In the philosophical and historical works there is no want
of attention to the flow and order and ornament of composition When we
come to the Advancement of Learning we come to a book which is one of
the landmarks of what high thought and rich imagination have made of
the English language It is the first great book in English prose of
secular interest the first book which can claim a place beside the
Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity As regards its subject-matter it has
been partly thrown into the shade by the greatly enlarged and elaborate
form in which it ultimately appeared in a Latin dress as the first
portion of the scheme of the Instauratio the De Augmentis
Scientiarum Bacon looked on it as a first effort a kind of call-bell
to awaken and attract the interest of others in the thoughts and hopes
which so interested himself But it contains some of his finest writing
In the Essays he writes as a looker-on at the game of human affairs
who according to his frequent illustration sees more of it than the
gamesters themselves and is able to give wiser and faithful counsel
not without a touch of kindly irony at the mistakes which he observes
In the Advancement he is the enthusiast for a great cause and a great
hope and all that he has of passion and power is enlisted in the effort
to advance it The Advancement is far from being a perfect book As a
survey of the actual state of knowledge in his day of its deficiencies
and what was wanted to supply them it is not even up to the materials
of the time Even the improved De Augmentis is inadequate and there
is reason to think the Advancement was a hurried book at least in the
later part and it is defective in arrangement and proportion of parts
Two of the great divisions of knowledge history and poetry are
despatched in comparatively short chapters while in the division on
Civil Knowledge human knowledge as it respects society he inserts a
long essay obviously complete in itself and clumsily thrust in here on
the ways of getting on in the world the means by which a man may be
Faber fortunæ suæ the architect of his own success too lively a
picture to be pleasant of the arts with which he had become acquainted
in the process of rising The book too has the blemishes of its own
time its want of simplicity its inevitable though very often amusing
and curious pedantries But the Advancement was the first of a long
line of books which have attempted to teach English readers how to think
of knowledge to make it really and intelligently the interest not of
the school or the study or the laboratory only but of society at large
It was a book with a purpose new then but of which we have seen the
fulfilment He wanted to impress on his generation as a very practical
matter all that knowledge might do in wise hands all that knowledge
had lost by the faults and errors of men and the misfortunes of time
all that knowledge might be pushed to in all directions by faithful and
patient industry and well-planned methods for the elevation and benefit
of man in his highest capacities as well as in his humblest And he
further sought to teach them how to know to make them understand that
difficult achievement of self-knowledge to know what it is to know
to give the first attempted chart to guide them among the shallows and
rocks and whirlpools which beset the course and action of thought and
inquiry to reveal to them the idols which unconsciously haunt the
minds of the strongest as well as the weakest and interpose their
delusions when we are least aware the fallacies and false appearances
inseparable from our nature and our condition of life To induce men to
believe not only that there was much to know that was not yet dreamed
of but that the way of knowing needed real and thorough improvement
that the knowing mind bore along with it all kinds of snares and
disqualifications of which it is unconscious and that it needed
training quite as much as materials to work on was the object of the
Advancement It was but a sketch but it was a sketch so truly and
forcibly drawn that it made an impression which has never been
weakened To us its use and almost its interest is passed But it is a
book which we can never open without coming on some noble interpretation
of the realities of nature or the mind some unexpected discovery of
that quick and keen eye which arrests us by its truth some felicitous
and unthought-of illustration yet so natural as almost to be doomed to
become a commonplace some bright touch of his incorrigible
imaginativeness ever ready to force itself in amid the driest details
of his argument

The Advancement was only one shape out of many into which he cast his
thoughts Bacon was not easily satisfied with his work even when he
published he did so not because he had brought his work to the desired
point but lest anything should happen to him and it should perish
Easy and unstudied as his writing seems it was as we have seen the
result of unintermitted trouble and varied modes of working He was
quite as much a talker as a writer and beat out his thoughts into shape
in talking In the essay on Friendship he describes the process with a
vividness which tells of his own experience 

     But before you come to that the faithful counsel that a man
     receiveth from his friend certain it is that whosoever hath his
     mind fraught with many thoughts his wits and understanding do
     clarify and break up in the communicating and discoursing with
     another He tosseth his thoughts more easily he marshalleth them
     more orderly he seeth how they look when they are turned into
     words finally he waxeth wiser than himself and that more by an
     hour's discourse than by a day's meditation It was well said by
     Themistocles to the King of Persia 'That speech was like cloth of
     arras opened and put abroad whereby the imagery doth appear in
     figure whereas in thought they lie in packs' Neither is this
     second fruit of friendship in opening the understanding
     restrained only to such friends as are able to give a man counsel
     They are indeed best But even without that a man learneth of
     himself and bringeth his own thoughts to light and whetteth his
     wits against a stone which itself cuts not In a word a man were
     better relate himself to a statua or a picture than to suffer
     his thoughts to pass in smother

Bacon as has been said was a great maker of notes and note-books he
was careful not of the thought only but of the very words in which it
presented itself everything was collected that might turn out useful in
his writing or speaking down to alternative modes of beginning or
connecting or ending a sentence He watched over his intellectual
appliances and resources much more strictly than over his money
concerns He never threw away and never forgot what could be turned to
account He was never afraid of repeating himself if he thought he had
something apt to say He was never tired of recasting and rewriting
from a mere fragment or preface to a finished paper He has favourite
images favourite maxims favourite texts which he cannot do without
Da Fidei quæ sunt Fidei comes in from his first book to his last
The illustrations which he gets from the myth of Scylla from Atalanta's
ball from Borgia's saying about the French marking their lodgings with
chalk the saying that God takes delight like the innocent play of
children to hide his works in order to have them found out and to
have kings as his playfellows in that game these with many others
reappear however varied the context from the first to the last of his
compositions An edition of Bacon with marginal references and parallel
passages would show a more persistent recurrence of characteristic
illustrations and sentences than perhaps any other writer

The Advancement was followed by attempts to give serious effect to its
lesson This was nearly all done in Latin He did so because in these
works he spoke to a larger and as he thought more interested audience
the use of Latin marked the gravity of his subject as one that touched
all mankind and the majesty of Latin suited his taste and his thoughts
Bacon spoke indeed impressively on the necessity of entering into the
realm of knowledge in the spirit of a little child He dwelt on the
paramount importance of beginning from the very bottom of the scale of
fact of understanding the commonplace things at our feet so full of
wonder and mystery and instruction before venturing on theories The
sun is not polluted by shining on a dunghill and no facts were too
ignoble to be beneath the notice of the true student of nature But his
own genius was for the grandeur and pomp of general views The practical
details of experimental science were except in partial instances yet a
great way off and what there was he either did not care about or
really understand and had no aptitude for handling He knew enough to
give reality to his argument he knew and insisted on it that the
labour of observation and experiment would have to be very heavy and
quite indispensable But his own business was with great principles and
new truths these were what had the real attraction for him it was the
magnificent thoughts and boundless hopes of the approaching kingdom of
man which kindled his imagination and fired his ambition He writes
philosophy said Harvey who had come to his own great discovery
through patient and obscure experiments on frogs and monkeys he writes
philosophy like a Lord Chancellor And for this part of the work the
stateliness and dignity of the Latin corresponded to the proud claims
which he made for his conception of the knowledge which was to be
English seemed to him too homely to express the hopes of the world too
unstable to be trusted with them Latin was the language of command and
law His Latin without enslaving itself to Ciceronian types and with a
free infusion of barbarous but most convenient words from the vast and
ingenious terminology of the schoolmen is singularly forcible and
expressive It is almost always easy and clear it can be vague and
general and it can be very precise where precision is wanted It can
on occasion be magnificent and its gravity is continually enlivened by
the play upon it as upon a background of his picturesque and
unexpected fancies The exposition of his philosophical principles was
attempted in two forms He began in English He began in the shape of a
personal account a statement of a series of conclusions to which his
thinking had brought him which he called the Clue of the Labyrinth
Filum Labyrinthi But he laid this aside unfinished and rewrote and
completed it in Latin with the title Cogitata et Visa It gains by
being in Latin as Mr Spedding says it must certainly be reckoned
among the most perfect of Bacon's productions The personal form with
each paragraph begins and ends Franciscus Bacon sic cogitavit 
itaque visum est ei gives to it a special tone of serious conviction
and brings the interest of the subject more keenly to the reader It has
the same kind of personal interest only more solemn and commanding
which there is in Descartes's Discours de la Méthode In this form
Bacon meant at first to publish He sent it to his usual critics Sir
Thomas Bodley Toby Matthews and Bishop Andrewes And he meant to
follow it up with a practical exemplification of his method But he
changed his plan He had more than once expressed his preference for
the form of aphorisms over the argumentative and didactic continuity
of a set discourse He had indeed already twice begun a series of
aphorisms on the true methods of interpreting nature and directing the
mind in the true path of knowledge and had begun them with the same
famous aphorism with which the Novum Organum opens He now reverted to
the form of the aphorism and resolved to throw the materials of the
Cogitata et Visa into this shape The result is the Novum Organum
It contains with large additions the substance of the treatise but
broken up and rearranged in the new form of separate impersonal
generalised observations The points and assertions and issues which in
a continuous discourse careful readers mark and careless ones miss are
one by one picked out and brought separately to the light It begins
with brief oracular unproved maxims and propositions and goes on
gradually into larger developments and explanations The aphorisms are
meant to strike to awaken questions to disturb prejudices to let in
light into a nest of unsuspected intellectual confusions and
self-misunderstandings to be the mottoes and watchwords of many a
laborious and difficult inquiry They form a connected and ordered
chain though the ties between each link are not given In this way
Bacon put forth his proclamation of war on all that then called itself
science his announcement that the whole work of solid knowledge must be
begun afresh and by a new and as he thought infallible method On
this work Bacon concentrated all his care It was twelve years in hand
and twelve times underwent his revision In the first book especially
says Mr Ellis every word seems to have been carefully weighed and it
would be hard to omit or change anything without injuring the meaning
which Bacon intended to convey Severe as it is it is instinct with
enthusiasm sometimes with passion The Latin in which it is written
answers to it it has the conciseness the breadth the lordliness of a
great piece of philosophical legislation

The world has agreed to date from Bacon the systematic reform of natural
philosophy the beginning of an intelligent attempt which has been
crowned by such signal success to place the investigation of nature on
a solid foundation On purely scientific grounds his title to this great
honour may require considerable qualification What one thing it is
asked would not have been discovered in the age of Galileo and Harvey
if Bacon had never written What one scientific discovery can be traced
to him or to the observance of his peculiar rules It was something
indeed to have conceived as clearly as he conceived it the large and
comprehensive idea of what natural knowledge must be and must rest
upon even if he were not able to realise his idea and were mistaken in
his practical methods of reform But great ideas and great principles
need their adequate interpreter their vates sacer if they are to
influence the history of mankind This was what Bacon was to science to
that great change in the thoughts and activity of men in relation to the
world of nature around them and this is his title to the great place
assigned to him He not only understood and felt what science might be
but he was able to make others and it was no easy task beforehand
while the wonders of discovery were yet in the future understand and
feel it too And he was able to do this because he was one of the most
wonderful of thinkers and one of the greatest of writers The
disclosure the interpretation the development of that great
intellectual revolution which was in the air and which was practically
carried forward in obscurity day by day by the fathers of modern
astronomy and chemistry and physiology had fallen to the task of a
genius second only to Shakespeare He had the power to tell the story
of what they were doing and were to do with a force of imaginative
reason of which they were utterly incapable He was able to justify
their attempts and their hopes as they themselves could not He was able
to interest the world in the great prospects opening on it but of which
none but a few students had the key The calculations of the astronomer
the investigations of the physician were more or less a subject of
talk as curious or possibly useful employments But that which bound
them together in the unity of science which gave them their meaning
beyond themselves which raised them to a higher level and gave them
their real dignity among the pursuits of men which forced all thinking
men to see what new and unsuspected possibilities in the knowledge and
in the condition of mankind were opened before them was not Bacon's own
attempts at science not even his collections of facts and his rules of
method but that great idea of the reality and boundless worth of
knowledge which Bacon's penetrating and sure intuition had discerned
and which had taken possession of his whole nature The impulse which he
gave to the progress of science came from his magnificent and varied
exposition of this idea from his series of grand and memorable
generalisations on the habits and faults of the human mind on the
