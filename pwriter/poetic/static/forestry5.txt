I hear admiral but it is scarcely civil to say the least of it
however as you are somewhat eccentric and do not I dare say mean all
your words imply I am quite willing to make every allowance

I don't want any allowance d n you and your allowance too nothing
but allowance of grog and a pretty good allowance too will do for me
and tell you Sir Francis Varney said the admiral with much wrath
that you are a d  d lubberly hound and I'll fight you yes I'm
ready to hammer away or with anything from a pop-gun to a ship's gun
you don't come over me with your gammon I tell you You've murdered
Charles Holland because you couldn't face him that's the truth of it

With the other part of your speech Admiral Bell allow me to say you
have mixed up a serious accusation one I cannot permit to pass
lightly

Will you or not fight

Oh yes I shall be happy to serve you any way that I can I hope this
will be an answer to your accusation also

That's settled then

Why I am not captious Admiral Bell but it is not generally usual for
the principals to settle the preliminaries themselves doubtless you in
your career of fame and glory know something of the manner in which
gentlemen demean themselves on these occasions

Oh d n you Yes I'll send some one to do all this Yes yes Jack
Pringle will be the man though Jack ain't a holiday shore-going
smooth-spoken swab but as good a seaman as ever trod deck or handled a
boarding-pike

Any friend of yours said Varney blandly will be received and
treated as such upon an errand of such consequence and now our
conference has I presume concluded

Yes yes I've done d  e no yes no I will keel-haul you but I'll
know something of my neavy Charles Holland

Good day Admiral Bell As Varney spoke he placed his hand upon the
bell which he had near him to summon an attendant to conduct the
admiral out The latter who had said a vast deal more than he ever
intended left the room in a great rage protesting to himself that he
would amply avenge his nephew Charles Holland

He proceeded homeward considerably vexed and annoyed that he had been
treated with so much calmness and all knowledge of his nephew denied

When he got back he quarrelled heartily with Jack Pringle made it
up drank grog quarrelled made it up and finished with grog
again until he went to bed swearing he should like to fire a broadside
at the whole of the French army and annihilate it at once

With this wish he fell asleep

Early next morning Henry Bannerworth sought Mr Chillingworth and
having found him he said in a serious tone 

Mr Chillingworth I have rather a serious favour to ask you and one
which you may hesitate in granting

It must be very serious indeed said Mr Chillingworth that I should
hesitate to grant it to you but pray inform me what it is that you deem
so serious

Sir Francis Varney and I must have a meeting said Henry

Have you really determined upon such a course said Mr Chillingworth
you know the character of your adversary

That is all settled I have given a challenge and he has accepted it
so all other considerations verge themselves into one and that is the
when where and how

I see said Mr Chillingworth Well since it cannot be helped on
your part I will do what is requisite for you do you wish anything to
be done or insisted on in particular in this affair

Nothing with regard to Sir Francis Varney that I may not leave to your
discretion I feel convinced that he is the assassin of Charles Holland
whom he feared to fight in duel

Then there remains but little else to do but to arrange preliminaries
I believe Are you prepared on every other point

I am you will see that I am the challenger and that he must now
fight What accident may turn up to save him I fear not but sure I am
that he will endeavour to take every advantage that may arise and so
escape the encounter

And what do you imagine he will do now he has accepted your challenge
said Mr Chillingworth one would imagine he could not very well
escape

No but he accepted the challenge which Charles Holland sent him a
duel was inevitable and it seems to me to be a necessary consequence
that he disappeared from amongst us for Mr Holland would never have
shrunk from the encounter

There can be no sort of suspicion about that remarked Chillingworth
but allow me to advise you that you take care of yourself and keep a
watchful eye upon every one do not be seen out alone

I fear not

Nay the gentleman who has disappeared was I am sure fearless enough
but yet that has not saved him I would not advise you to be fearful
only watchful you have now an event awaiting upon you which it is well
you should go through with unless circumstances should so turn out
that it is needless therefore I say when you have the suspicions you
do entertain of this man's conduct beware be cautious and vigilant

I will do so in the mean time I trust myself confidently in your
hands you know all that is necessary

This affair is quite a secret from all of the family

Most certainly so and will remain so I shall be at the Hall

And there I will see you but be careful not to be drawn into any
adventure of any kind it is best to be on the safe side under all
circumstances

I will be especially careful be assured but farewell see Sir Francis
Varney as early as you can and let the meeting be as early as you can
and thus diminish the chance of accident

That I will attend to Farewell for the present

Mr Chillingworth immediately set about the conducting of the affair
thus confided to him and that no time might be lost he determined to
set out at once for Sir Francis Varney's residence

Things with regard to this family seem to have gone on wild of late
thought Mr Chillingworth this may bring affairs to a conclusion
though I had much rather they had come to some other My life for it
there is a juggle or a mystery somewhere I will do this and then we
shall see what will come of it if this Sir Francis Varney meets
him and at this moment I can see no reason why he should not do so it
will tend much to deprive him of the mystery about him but if on the
other hand he refuse but then that's all improbable because he has
agreed to do so I fear however that such a man as Varney is a
dreadful enemy to encounter he is cool and unruffled and that gives
him all the advantage in such affairs but Henry's nerves are not bad
though shaken by these untowards events but time will show I would it
were all over

With these thoughts and feelings strangely intermixed Mr Chillingworth
set forward for Sir Francis Varney's house

                                   

Admiral Bell slept soundly enough though towards morning he fell into
a strange dream and thought he was yard arm and yard arm with a strange
fish something of the mermaid species

Well exclaimed the admiral after a customary benediction of his eyes
and limbs what's to come next may I be spliced to a shark if I
understand what this is all about I had some grog last night but then
grog d'y'see is is a seaman's native element as the newspapers say
though I never read em now it's such a plague

He lay quiet for a short time considering in his own mind what was best
to be done and what was the proper course to pursue and why he should
dream

Hilloa hilloa hil loa Jack a-hoy a-hoy shouted the admiral as a
sudden recollection of his challenge came across his memory Jack
Pringle a-hoy d n you where are you you're never at hand when you
are wanted Oh you lubber a-hoy

A-hoy shouted a voice as the door opened and Jack thrust his head
in what cheer messmate what ship is this

Oh you lubberly 

The door was shut in a minute and Jack Pringle disappeared

Hilloa Jack Pringle you don't mean to say you'll desert your colours
do you you dumb dog

Who says I'll desert the ship as she's sea-worthy

Then why do you go away

Because I won't be called lubberly I'm as good a man as ever swabbed a
deck and don't care who says to the contrary I'll stick to the ship as
long as she's seaworthy said Jack

Well come here and just listen to the log and be d  d to you

What's the orders now admiral said Jack though as we are paid
off 

There take that will you said Admiral Bell as he flung a pillow at
Jack being the only thing in the shape of a missile within reach

Jack ducked and the pillow produced a clatter in the washhand-stand
among the crockery as Jack said 

There's a mutiny in the ship and hark how the cargo clatters will you
have it back again

Come will you I've been dreaming Jack

Dreaming what's that

Thinking of something when you are asleep you swab

Ha ha ha laughed Jack never did such a thing in my life ha ha
ha what's the matter now

I'll tell you what's the matter Jack Pringle you are becoming
mutinous and I won't have it if you don't hold your jaw and draw in
your slacks I'll have another second

Another second what's in the wind now said Jack Is this the
dream

If ever I dream when I'm alongside a strange craft then it is a dream
but old Admiral Bell ain't the man to sleep when there's any work to be
done

That's uncommon true said Jack turning a quid

Well then I'm going to fight

Fight exclaimed Jack Avast there I don't see where's the
enemy none o that gammon Jack Pringle can fight too and will lay
alongside his admiral but he don't see the enemy anywhere

You don't understand these things so I'll tell you I have had a bit
of talk with Sir Francis Varney and I am going to fight him

What the wamphigher remarked Jack parenthetically

Yes

Well then resumed Jack then we shall see another blaze at least
afore we die but he's an odd fish one of Davy Jones's sort

I don't care about that he may be anything he likes but Admiral Bell
ain't a-going to have his nephew burned and eaten and sucked like I
don't know what by a vampire or by any other confounded land-shark

In course said Jack we ain't a-going to put up with nothing of that
sort and if so be as how he has put him out of the way why it's our
duty to send him after him and square the board

That's the thing Jack now you know you must go to Sir Francis Varney
and tell him you come from me

I don't care if I goes on my own account said Jack

That won't do I've challenged him and I must fight him

In course you will returned Jack and if he blows you away why
I'll take your place and have a blaze myself

The admiral gave a look at Jack of great admiration and then said 

You are a d  d good seaman Jack but he's a knight and might say no
to that but do you go to him and tell him that you come from me to
settle the when and the where this duel is to be fought

Single fight said Jack

Yes consent to any thing that is fair said the admiral but let it
be as soon as you can Now do you understand what I have said

Yes to be sure I ain't lived all these years without knowing your
lingo

Then go at once and don't let the honour of Admiral Bell and old
England suffer Jack I'm his man you know at any price

Never fear said Jack you shall fight him at any rate I'll go and
see he don't back out the warmint

Then go along Jack and mind don't you go blazing away like a fire
ship and letting everybody know what's going on or it'll be stopped

I'll not spoil sport said Jack as he left the room to go at once to
Sir Francis Varney charged with the conducting of the important cartel
of the admiral Jack made the best of his way with becoming gravity and
expedition until he reached the gate of the admiral's enemy

Jack rang loudly at the gate there seemed if one might judge by his
countenance a something on his mind that Jack was almost another man
The gate was opened by the servant who inquired what he wanted there

The wamphigher

Who

The wamphigher

The servant frowned and was about to say something uncivil to Jack who
winked at him very hard and then said 

Oh may be you don't know him or won't know him by that name I wants
to see Sir Francis Varney

He's at home said the servant who are you

Show me up then I'm Jack Pringle and I'm come from Admiral Bell I'm
the Admiral's friend you see so none of your black looks

The servant seemed amazed as well as rather daunted at Jack's address
he showed him however into the hall where Mr Chillingworth had just
that moment arrived and was waiting for an interview with Varney




 XXXVIII

MARCHDALE'S OFFER THE CONSULTATION AT BANNERWORTH HALL THE MORNING
OF THE DUEL


Illustration

Mr Chillingworth was much annoyed to see Jack Pringle in the hall and
Jack was somewhat surprised at seeing Mr Chillingworth there at that
time in the rooming they had but little time to indulge in their mutual
astonishment for a servant came to announce that Sir Francis Varney
would see them both

Without saying anything to the servant or each other they ascended the
staircase and were shown into the apartment where Sir Francis Varney
received them

Gentlemen said Sir Francis in his usual bland tone you are
welcome

Sir Francis said Mr Chillingworth I have come upon matters of some
importance may I crave a separate audience

And I too said Jack Pringle I come as the friend of Admiral Bell I
want a private audience but stay I don't care a rope's end who knows
who I am or what I come about say you are ready to name time and
place and I'm as dumb as a figure-head that is saying something at all
events and now I'm done

Why gentlemen said Sir Francis with a quiet smile as you have
both come upon the same errand and as there may arise a controversy
upon the point of precedence you had better be both present as I must
arrange this matter myself upon due inquiry

I do not exactly understand this said Mr Chillingworth do you Mr
Pringle perhaps you can enlighten me

It said Jack as how you came here upon the same errand as I and I
as you why we both come about fighting Sir Francis Varney

Yes said Sir Francis what Mr Pringle says is I believe correct
to a letter I have a challenge from both your principals and am ready
to give you both the satisfaction you desire provided the first
encounter will permit me the honour of joining in the second You Mr
Pringle are aware of the chances of war

I should say so said Jack with a wink and a nod of a familiar
character I've seen a few of them

Will you proceed to make the necessary agreement between you both
gentlemen My affection for the one equals fully the good will I bear
the other and I cannot give a preference in so delicate a matter
proceed gentlemen

Mr Chillingworth looked at Jack and Jack Pringle looked at Mr
Chillingworth and then the former said 

Well the admiral means fighting and I am come to settle the
necessaries pray let me know what are your terms Mr
What-d'ye-call'em

I am agreeable to anything that is at all reasonable pistols I
presume

Sir Francis Varney said Mr Chillingworth I cannot consent to carry
on this office unless you can appoint a friend who will settle these
matters with us myself at least

And I too said Jack Pringle we don't want to bear down an enemy
Admiral Bell ain't the man to do that and if he were I'm not the man
to back him in doing what isn't fair or right but he won't do it

But gentlemen this must not be Mr Henry Bannerworth must not be
disappointed and Admiral Bell must not be disappointed Moreover I
have accepted the two cartels and I am ready and willing to fight one
at a time I presume

Sir Francis after what you have said I must take upon myself on the
part of Mr Henry Bannerworth to decline meeting you if you cannot
name a friend with whom I can arrange this affair

Ah said Jack Pringle that's right enough I recollect very well
when Jack Mizeu fought Tom Foremast they had their seconds Admiral
Bell can't do anything in the dark No no d  e all must be above
board

Gentlemen said Sir Francis Varney you see the dilemma I am in Your
principals have both challenged me I am ready to fight any one or both
of them as the case may be Distinctly understand that because it is a
notion of theirs that I will not do so or that I shrink from them but
I am a stranger in this neighbourhood and have no one whom I could call
upon to relinquish so much as they run the risk of doing by attending
me to the field

Then your acquaintances are no friends d  e said Jack Pringle
spitting through his teeth into the bars of a beautifully polished
grate I'd stick to anybody the devil himself leave alone a
vampire if so be as how I had been his friends and drunk grog from the
same can They are a set of lubbers

I have not been here long enough to form any such friendships Mr
Chillingworth but can confidently rely upon your honour and that of
your principal and will freely and fairly meet him

But Sir Francis you forget the fact in transacting myself for
Mr Bannerworth and this person or Admiral Bell we do match and have
our own characters at stake nay more our lives and fortunes These may
be small but they are everything to us Allow me to say on my own
behalf that I will not permit my principal to meet you unless you can
name a second as is usual with gentlemen on such occasions

I regret while I declare to you my entire willingness to meet you
that I cannot comply through utter inability to do so with your
request Let this go forth to the world as I have stated it and let it
be an answer to any aspersions that may be uttered as to my
unwillingness to fight

There was a pause of some moments Mr Chillingworth was resolved that
come of it what would he would not permit Henry to fight unless Sir
Francis Varney himself should appoint a friend and then they could meet
upon equal terms

Jack Pringle whistled and spit and chewed and turned his quid hitched
up his trousers and looked wistfully from one to the other as he
said 

So then it's likely to be no fight at all Sir Francis what's-o'-name

It seems like it Mr Pringle replied Varney with a meaning smile
unless you can be more complaisant towards myself and kind towards the
admiral

Why not exactly that said Jack it's a pity to stop a good play in
the beginning just because some little thing is wrong in the tackling

Perhaps your skill and genius may enable us to find some medium course
that we may pursue with pleasure and profit What say you Mr Pringle

All I know about genius as you call it is the Flying Dutchman or some
such odd out of the way fish But as I said I am not one to spoil
sport nor more is the admiral Oh no we is all true men and good

I believe it said Varney bowing politely

You needn't keep your figure-head on the move I can see you just as
well Howsoever as I was saying I don't like to spoil sport and
sooner than both parties should be disappointed my principal shall
become your second Sir Francis

What Admiral Bell exclaimed Varney lifting his eyebrows with
surprise

What Charles Holland's uncle exclaimed Mr Chillingworth in accents
of amazement

And why not said Jack with great gravity I will pledge my
word Jack Pringle's word that Admiral Bell shall be second to Sir
Francis Varney during his scrimmage with Mr Henry Bannerworth That
will let the matter go on there can be no back-out then eh continued
Jack Pringle with a knowing nod at Chillingworth as he spoke

That will I hope remove your scruples Mr Chillingworth said
Varney with a courteous smile

But will Admiral Bell do this

His second says so and has I daresay influence enough with him to
induce that person to act in conformity with his promise

In course he will Do you think he would be the man to hang back Oh
no he would be the last to leave Jack Pringle in the lurch no Depend
upon it Sir Francis he'll be as sure to do what I say as I have said
it

After that assurance I cannot doubt it said Sir Francis Varney
this act of kindness will indeed lay me under a deep and lasting
obligation to Admiral Bell which I fear I shall never be able to pay

You need not trouble yourself about that said Jack Pringle the
admiral will credit all and you can pay off old scores when his turn
comes in the field

I will not forget said Varney he deserves every consideration but
now Mr Chillingworth I presume that we may come to some understanding
respecting this meeting which you were so kind as to do me the honour
of seeking

I cannot object to its taking place I shall be most happy to meet your
second in the field and will arrange with him

I imagine that under the circumstances that it will be barely
necessary to go to that length of ceremony Future interviews can be
arranged later name the time and place and after that we can settle
all the rest on the ground

Yes said Jack it will be time enough surely to see the admiral
when we are upon the ground I'll warrant the old buffer is a true brick
as ever was there's no flinching about him

I am satisfied said Varney

And I also said Chillingworth but understand Sir Francis any
default for seconds makes the meeting a blank

I will not doubt Mr Pringle's honour so much as to believe it
possible

I'm d  d said Jack if you ain't a trump-card and no mistake
it's a great pity as you is a wamphigher

The time Mr Chillingworth

To-morrow at seven o'clock replied that gentleman

The place sir

The best place that I can think of is a level meadow half-way between
here and Bannerworth Hall but that is your privilege Sir Francis
Varney

I waive it and am much obliged to you for the choice of the spot it
seems of the best character imaginable I will be punctual

I think we have nothing further to arrange now said Mr
Chillingworth You will meet with Admiral Bell

Certainly I believe there is nothing more to be done this affair is
very satisfactorily arranged and much better than I anticipated

Good morning Sir Francis said Mr Chillingworth Good morning

Adieu said Sir Francis with a courteous salutation Good day Mr
Pringle and commend me to the admiral whose services will be of
infinite value to me

Don't mention it said Jack the admiral's the man as'd lend any body
a helping hand in case of distress like the present and I'll pledge my
word Jack Pringle's too as that he'll do what's right and give up his
turn to Mr Henry Bannerworth cause you see he can have his turn
arterwards you know it's only waiting awhile

That's all said Sir Francis

Jack Pringle made a sea bow and took his leave as he followed Mr
Chillingworth and they both left the house together to return to
Bannerworth Hall

Well said Mr Chillingworth I am glad that Sir Francis Varney has
got over the difficulty of having no seconds for it would not be proper
or safe to meet a man without a friend for him

It ain't the right thing said Jack hitching up his trousers but I
was afeard as how he would back out and that would be just the wrong
thing for the admiral he'd go raving mad

They had got but very few paces from Sir Francis Varney's house when
they were joined by Marchdale

Ah he said as he came up I see you have been to Sir Francis
Varney's if I may judge from the direction whence you're coming and
your proximity

Yes we have said Mr Chillingworth I thought you had left these
parts

I had intended to do so replied Marchdale but second thoughts are
sometimes best you know

Certainly

I have so much friendship for the family at the hall that
notwithstanding I am compelled to be absent from the mansion itself yet
I cannot quit the neighbourhood while there are circumstances of such a
character hanging about them I will remain and see if there be not
something arising in which I may be useful to them in some matter

It is very disinterested of you you will remain here for some time I
suppose

Yes undoubtedly unless as I do not anticipate I should see any
occasion to quit my present quarters

I tell you what it is said Jack Pringle if you had been here
half-an-hour earlier you could have seconded the wamphigher

Seconded

Yes we're here to challenge

A double challenge

Yes but in confiding this matter to you Mr Marchdale you will make
no use of it to the exploding of this affair By so doing you will
seriously damage the honour of Mr Henry Bannerworth

I will not you may rely upon it but Mr Chillingworth do I not see
you in the character of a second

You do sir

To Mr Henry

The same sir

Have you reflected upon the probable consequences of such an act
should any serious mischief occur

What I have undertaken Mr Marchdale I will go through with the
consequences I have duly considered and yet you see me in the character
of Mr Henry Bannerworth's friend

I am happy to see you as such and I do not think Henry could find a
better But this is beside the question What induced me to make the
remark was this had I been at the hall you will admit that Henry
Bannerworth would have chosen myself without any disparagement to you
Mr Chillingworth

Well sir what then

Why I am a single man I can live reside and go any where one country
will suit me as well as another I shall suffer no loss but as for you
you will be ruined in every particular for if you go in the character
of a second you will not be excused for all the penalties incurred
your profession of a surgeon will not excuse you

I see all that sir

What I propose is that you should accompany the parties to the field
but in your own proper character of surgeon and permit me to take that
of second to Mr Bannerworth

This cannot be done unless by Mr Henry Bannerworth's consent said
Mr Chillingworth

Then I will accompany you to Bannerworth Hall and see Mr Henry whom
I will request to permit me to do what I have mentioned to you

Mr Chillingworth could not but admit the reasonableness of this
proposal and it was agreed they should return to Bannerworth Hall in
company

Here they arrived in a very short time after and entered together

And now said Mr Chillingworth I will go and bring our two
principals who will be as much astonished to find themselves engaged in
the same quarrel as I was to find myself sent on a similar errand to
Sir Francis with our friend Mr John Pringle

Oh not John Jack Pringle you mean said that individual

Chillingworth now went in search of Henry and sent him to the apartment
where Mr Marchdale was with Jack Pringle and then he found the admiral
waiting the return of Jack with impatience

Admiral he said I perceive you are unwell this morning

Unwell be d  d said the admiral starting up with surprise Who
ever heard that old admiral Bell looked ill just afore he was going into
action I say it's a scandalous lie

Admiral admiral I didn't say you were ill only you looked ill a a
little nervous or so Rather pale eh Is it not so

Confound you do you think I want to be physicked I tell you I have
not a little but a great inclination to give you a good keelhauling I
don't want a doctor just yet

But it may not be so long you know admiral but there is Jack Pringle
a-waiting you below Will you go to him There is a particular reason
he has something to communicate from Sir Francis Varney I believe

The admiral gave a look of some amazement at Mr Chillingworth and then
he said muttering to himself 

If Jack Pringle should have betrayed me but no he could not do that
he is too true I'm sure of Jack and how did that son of a gallipot
hint about the odd fish I sent Jack to

Filled with a dubious kind of belief which he had about something he had
heard of Jack Pringle he entered the room where he met Marchdale Jack
Pringle and Henry Bannerworth Immediately afterwards Mr
Chillingworth entered the apartment

I have said he been to Sir Francis Varney and there had an
interview with him and with Mr Pringle when I found we were both
intent upon the same object namely an encounter with the knight by our
principals

Eh said the admiral

What exclaimed Henry had he challenged you admiral

Challenged me exclaimed Admiral Bell with a round oath
I however since it comes to this I must admit I challenged him

That's what I did said Henry Bannerworth after a moment's thought
and I perceive we have both fallen into the same line of conduct

That is the fact said Mr Chillingworth Both Mr Pringle and I went
there to settle the preliminaries and we found an insurmountable bar to
any meeting taking place at all

He wouldn't fight then exclaimed Henry I see it all now

Not fight said Admiral Bell with a sort of melancholy
disappointment D n the cowardly rascal Tell me Jack Pringle what
did the long horse-marine-looking slab say to it He told me he would
fight Why he ought to be made to stand sentry over the wind

You challenged him in person too I suppose said Henry

Yes confound him I went there last night

And I too

It seems to me said Marchdale that this affair has been not
indiscretely conducted but somewhat unusually and strangely to say the
least of it

You see said Chillingworth Sir Francis was willing to fight both
Henry and the admiral as he told us

Yes said Jack he told us he would fight us both if so be as his
light was not doused in the first brush

That was all that was wanted said the admiral

We could expect no more

But then he desired to meet you without any second but of course I
would not accede to this proposal The responsibility was too great and
too unequally borne by the parties engaged in the rencontre

Decidedly said Henry but it is unfortunate very unfortunate

Very said the admiral very What a rascally thing it is there ain't
another rogue in the country to keep him in countenance

Illustration

I thought it was a pity to spoil sport said Jack Pringle It was a
pity a good intention should be spoiled and I promised the wamphigher
that if as how he would fight you should second him and you'd meet him
to do so

Eh who I exclaimed the admiral in some perplexity

Yes that is the truth said Mr Chillingworth Mr Pringle said you
would do so and he then and there pledged his word that you should meet
him on the ground and second him

Yes said Jack You must do it I knew you would not spoil sport and
that there had better be a fight than no fight I believe you'd sooner
see a scrimmage than none and so it's all arranged

Very well said the admiral I only wish Mr Henry Bannerworth had
been his second I think I was entitled to the first meeting

No said Jack you warn't for Mr Chillingworth was there first
first come first served you know

Well well I mustn't grumble at another man's luck mine'll come in
turn but it had better be so than a disappointment altogether I'll be
second to this Sir Francis Varney he shall have fair play as I'm an
admiral but d  e he shall fight yes yes he shall fight

And to this conclusion I would come said Henry I wish him to fight
now I will take care that he shall not have any opportunity of putting
me on one side quietly

There is one thing observed Marchdale that I wished to propose
After what has passed I should not have returned had I not some
presentiment that something was going forward in which I could be useful
to my friend

Oh said the admiral with a huge twist of his countenance

What I was about to say was this Mr Chillingworth has much to lose
as he is situated and I nothing as I am placed I am chained down to no
spot of earth I am above following a profession my means I mean
place me above the necessity Now Henry allow me to be your second in
this affair allow Mr Chillingworth to attend in his professional
capacity he may be of service of great service to one of the
principals whereas if he go in any other capacity he will inevitably
have his own safety to consult

That is most unquestionably true said Henry and to my mind the
best plan that can be proposed What say you Admiral Bell will you act
with Mr Marchdale in this affair

Oh I Yes certainly I don't care Mr Marchdale is Mr Marchdale I
believe and that's all I care about If we quarrel to-day and have
anything to do to-morrow in course to-morrow I can put off my quarrel
for next day it will keep that's all I have to say at present

Then this is a final arrangement said Mr Chillingworth

It is

But Mr Bannerworth in resigning my character of second to Mr
Marchdale I only do so because it appears and seems to be the opinion
of all present that I can be much better employed in another capacity

Certainly Mr Chillingworth and I cannot but feel that I am under the
same obligations to you for the readiness and zeal with which you have
acted

I have done what I have done said Chillingworth because I believed
it was my duty to do so

Mr Chillingworth has undoubtedly acted most friendly and efficiently
in this affair said Marchdale and he does not relinquish the part
for the purpose of escaping a friendly deed but to perform one in which
he may act in a capacity that no one else can

That is true said the admiral

And now said Chillingworth you are to meet to-morrow morning in the
meadow at the bottom of the valley half way between here and Sir
Francis Varney's house at seven o'clock in the morning

More conversation passed among them and it was agreed that they should
meet early the next morning and that of course the affair should be
kept a secret

Marchdale for that night should remain in the house and the admiral
should appear as if little or nothing was the matter and he and Jack
Pringle retired to talk over in private all the arrangements

Henry Bannerworth and Marchdale also retired and Mr Chillingworth
after a time retired promising to be with them in time for the meeting
next morning

Much of that day was spent by Henry Bannerworth in his own apartment in
writing documents and letters of one kind and another but at night he
had not finished for he had been compelled to be about and in Flora's
presence to prevent anything from being suspected

Marchdale was much with him and in secret examined the arms
ammunition and bullets and saw all was right for the next morning and
when he had done he said 

Now Henry you must permit me to insist that you take some hours'
repose else you will scarcely be as you ought to be

Very good said Henry I have just finished and can take your
advice

After many thoughts and reflections Henry Bannerworth fell into a deep
sleep and slept several hours in calmness and quietude and at an early
hour he awoke and saw Marchdale sitting by him

Is it time Marchdale I have not overslept myself have I

No time enough time enough said Marchdale I should have let you
sleep longer but I should have awakened you in good time

It was now the grey light of morning and Henry arose and began to
prepare for the encounter Marchdale stole to Admiral Bell's chamber
but he and Jack Pringle were ready

Few words were spoken and those few were in a whisper and the whole
party left the Hall in as noiseless a manner as possible It was a mild
morning and yet it was cold at that time of the morning just as day is
beginning to dawn in the east There was however ample time to reach
the rendezvous

It was a curious party that which was now proceeding towards the spot
appointed for the duel the result of which might have so important an
effect on the interests of those who were to be engaged in it

It would be difficult for us to analyse the different and conflicting
emotions that filled the breasts of the various individuals composing
that party the hopes and fears the doubts and surmises that were given
utterance to though we are compelled to acknowledge that though to
Henry the character of the man he was going to meet in mortal fight was
of a most ambiguous and undefined nature and though no one could
imagine the means he might be endowed with for protection against the
arms of man Henry as we said strode firmly forward with unflinching
resolution His heart was set on recovering the happiness of his sister
and he would not falter

So far then we may consider that at length proceedings of a hostile
character were so far clearly and fairly arranged between Henry
Bannerworth and that most mysterious being who certainly from some
cause or another had betrayed no inclination to meet an opponent in
that manner which is sanctioned bad as it is by the usages of society

But whether his motive was one of cowardice or mercy remained yet to be
seen It might be that he feared himself receiving some mortal injury
which would at once put a stop to that preternatural career of existence
which he affected to shudder at and yet evidently took considerable
pains to prolong

Upon the other hand it is just possible that some consciousness of
invulnerability on his own part or of great power to injure his
antagonist might be the cause why he had held back so long from
fighting the duel and placed so many obstacles in the way of the usual
necessary arrangements incidental to such occasions

Now however there would seem to be no possible means of escape Sir
Francis Varney must fight or fly for he was surrounded by too many
opponents

To be sure he might have appealed to the civil authorities to protect
him and to sanction him in his refusal to commit what undoubtedly is a
legal offence but then there cannot be a question that the whole of the
circumstances would come out and meet the public eye the result of
which would be his acquisition of a reputation as unenviable as it
would be universal

It had so happened that the peculiar position of the Bannerworth family
kept their acquaintance within extremely narrow limits and greatly
indisposed them to set themselves up as marks for peculiar observation

Once holding as they had a proud position in the county and being
looked upon quite as magnates of the land they did not now court the
prying eye of curiosity to look upon their poverty but rather with a
gloomy melancholy they lived apart and repelled the advances of society
by a cold reserve which few could break through

Had this family suffered in any noble cause or had the misfortunes
which had come over them and robbed their ancestral house of its
lustre been an unavoidable dispensation of providence they would have
borne the hard position with a different aspect but it must be
remembered that to the faults the vices and the criminality of some
of their race was to be attributed their present depressed state

It has been seen during the progress of our tale that its action has
been tolerably confined to Bannerworth Hall its adjacent meadows and
the seat of Sir Francis Varney the only person at any distance knowing
anything of the circumstances or feeling any interest in them being
Mr Chillingworth the surgeon who from personal feeling as well as
from professional habit was not likely to make a family's affairs a
subject of gossip

A change however was at hand a change of a most startling and
alarming character to Varney one which he might expect yet not be well
prepared for

This period of serenity was to pass away and he was to become most
alarmingly popular We will not however anticipate but proceed at
once to detail as briefly as may be the hostile meeting

It would appear that Varney now that he had once consented to the
definitive arrangements of a duel shrunk not in any way from carrying
them out nor in the slightest attempted to retard arrangements which
might be fatal to himself

The early morning was one of those cloudy ones so frequently occurring
in our fickle climate when the cleverest weather prophet would find it
difficult to predict what the next hour might produce

There was a kind of dim gloominess over all objects and as there were
no bright lights there were no deep shadows the consequence of which
was a sureness of effect over the landscape that robbed it of many of
its usual beauties

Such was the state of things when Marchdale accompanied Henry and
Admiral Bell from Bannerworth Hall across the garden in the direction of
the hilly wood close to which was the spot intended for the scene of
encounter

Jack Pringle came on at a lazy pace behind with his hands in his
pockets and looking as unconcerned as if he had just come out for a
morning's stroll and scarcely knew whether he saw what was going on or
not

The curious contortion into which he twisted his countenance and the
different odd-looking lumps that appeared in it from time to time may
be accounted for by a quid of unusual size which he seemed to be
masticating with a relish quite horrifying to one unused to so barbarous
a luxury

The admiral had strictly enjoined him not to interfere on pain of being
considered a lubber and no seaman for the remainder of his
existence threatened penalties which of course had their own weight
with Jack and accordingly he came just to see the row in as quiet a
way as possible perhaps not without a hope that something might turn
up in the shape of a causus belli that might justify him in adopting
a threatening attitude towards somebody

Now Master Henry said the admiral none of your palaver to me as we
go along recollect I don't belong to your party you know I've stood
friend to two or three fellows in my time but if anybody had said to
me Admiral Bell the next time you go out on a quiet little shooting
party it will be as second to a vampire I'd have said you're a liar'
Howsomever d me here you goes and what I mean to say is this Mr
Henry that I'd second even a Frenchman rather than he shouldn't fight
when he's asked

That's liberal of you said Henry at all event

I believe you it is said the admiral so mind if you don't hit him
I'm not a-going to tell you how all you've got to do is to fire low
but that's no business of mine Shiver my timbers I oughtn't to tell
you but d n you hit him if you can

Admiral said Henry I can hardly think you are even preserving a
neutrality in the matter putting aside my own partisanship as regards
your own man

Oh hang him I'm not going to let him creep out of the thing on such a
shabby pretence I can tell you I think I ought to have gone to his
house this morning only as I said I never would cross his threshold
again I won't

I wonder if he'll come said Mr Marchdale to Henry After all you
know he may take to flight and shun an encounter which it is evident
he has entered into but tardily

I hope not said Henry and yet I must own that your supposition has
several times crossed my mind If however he do not meet me he never
can appear at all in the country and we should at least be rid of
him and all his troublesome importunities concerning the Hall I would
not allow that man on any account to cross the threshold of my house
as its tenant or its owner

Why it ain't usual said the admiral to let ones house to two
people at once unless you seem quite to forget that I've taken yours I
may as well remind you of it

Hurra said Jack Pringle at this moment

What's the matter with you Who told you to hurra

Enemy in the offing said Jack three or four pints to the sou-west

So he is by Jove dodging about among the trees Come now this
vampire's a decenter fellow than I thought him He means after all to
let us have a pop at him

They had now reached so close to the spot that Sir Francis Varney who
to all appearance had been waiting emerged from among the trees
rolled up in his dismal-looking cloak and if possible looking longer
and thinner than ever he had looked before

His face wore a singular cadaverous looking aspect His very lips were
white and there was a curious pinkish-looking circle round each of his
eyes that imparted to his whole countenance a most uninviting
appearance He turned his eyes from one to the other of those who were
advancing towards him until he saw the admiral upon which he gave such
a grim and horrible smile that the old man exclaimed 

I say Jack you lubber there's a face for a figure head

Ay ay sir

Did you ever see such a d  d grin as that in your life in any
latitude

Ay ay sir

You did you swab

I should think so

It's a lie and you know it

Very good said Jack don't you recollect when that ere iron bullet
walked over your head leaving a nice little nick all the way off
Bergen-ap-Zoom that was the time blessed if you didn't give just such
a grin as that

I didn't you rascal

And I say you did

Mutiny by God

Go to blazes

How far this contention might have gone having now reached its
culminating point had the admiral and Jack been alone it is hard to
say but as it was Henry and Marchdale interfered and so the quarrel
was patched up for the moment in order to give place to more important
affairs

Varney seemed to think that after the smiling welcome he had given to
his second he had done quite enough for there he stood tall and
gaunt and motionless if we may except an occasional singular movement
of the mouth and a clap together of his teeth at times which was
enough to make anybody jump to hear

For Heaven's sake said Marchdale do not let us trifle at such a
moment as this Mr Pringle you really had no business here

Mr who said Jack

Pringle I believe is your name returned Marchdale

It were but blowed if ever I was called mister before

The admiral walked up to Sir Francis Varney and gave him a nod that
looked much more like one of defiance than of salutation to which the
vampire replied by a low courtly bow

Oh bother muttered the old admiral If I was to double up my
backbone like that I should never get it down straight again Well
all's right you've come that's all you could do I suppose

I am here said Varney and therefore it becomes a work of
supererogation to remark that I've come

Oh does it I never bolted a dictionary and therefore I don't know
exactly what you mean

Step aside with me a moment Admiral Bell and I will tell you what you
are to do with me after I am shot if such should be my fate

Do with you D  d if I'll do anything with you

I don't expect you will regret me you will eat

Eat

Yes and drink as usual no doubt notwithstanding being witness to the
decease of a fellow-creature

Belay there don't call yourself a fellow-creature of mine I ain't a
vampire

But there's no knowing what you may be and now listen to my
instructions for as you're my second you cannot very well refuse to me
a few friendly offices Rain is falling Step beneath this ancient tree
and I will talk to you




 XXXIX

THE STORM AND THE FIGHT-THE ADMIRAL'S REPUDIATION OF HIS PRINCIPAL


Illustration

Well said the admiral when they were fairly under the tree upon the
leaves of which the pattering rain might be heard falling well what
is it

If your young friend Mr Bannerworth should chance to send a
pistol-bullet through any portion of my anatomy prejudicial to the
prolongation of my existence you will be so good as not to interfere
with anything I may have about me or to make any disturbance whatever

You may depend I sha'n't

Just take the matter perfectly easy as a thing of course

Oh I mean d  d easy

Ha what a delightful thing is friendship There is a little knoll or
mound of earth midway between here and the Hall Do you happen to know
it There is one solitary tree glowing near its summit an oriental
looking tree of the fir tribe which fan-like spreads its deep green
leaves across the azure sky

Oh bother it it's a d  d old tree growing upon a little bit of a
hill I suppose you mean

Precisely only much more poetically expressed The moon rises at a
quarter past four to-night or rather to-morrow morning

Does it

Yes and if I should happen to be killed you will have me removed
gently to this mound of earth and there laid beneath this tree with my
face upwards and take care that it is done before the moon rises You
can watch that no one interferes

A likely job What the deuce do you take me for I tell you what it is
Mr vampire or Varney or whatever's your name if you should chance to
be hit where-ever you chance to fall there you'll lie

How very unkind

Uncommon ain't it

Well well since that is your determination I must take care of
myself in another way I can do so and I will

Take care of yourself how you like for all I care I've come here to
second you and to see that on the honour of a seaman if you are put
out of the world it's done in a proper manner that's all I have to do
with you now you know

Sir Francis Varney looked after him with a strange kind of smile as he
walked away to make the necessary preparation with Marchdale for the
immediate commencement of the contest

These were simple and brief It was agreed that twelve paces should be
measured out six each way from a fixed point one six to be paced by
the admiral and the other by Marchdale then they were to draw lots to
see at which end of this imaginary line Varney was to be placed after
this the signal for firing was to be one two three fire

A few minutes sufficed to complete these arrangements the ground was
measured in the manner we have stated and the combatants placed in
their respective positions Sir Francis Varney occupying the same spot
where he had at first stood namely that nearest to the little wood
and to his own residence

It is impossible that under such circumstances the bravest and the
calmest of mankind could fail to feel some slight degree of tremour or
uneasiness and although we can fairly claim for Henry Bannerworth that
he was as truly courageous as any right feeling Christian man could wish
to be yet when it was possible that he stood within as it were a
hair's breadth of eternity a strange world of sensation and emotions
found a home in his heart and he could not look altogether undaunted on
that future which might for all he knew to the contrary be so close at
hand as far as he was concerned

It was not that he feared death but that he looked with a decent
gravity upon so grave a change as that from this world to the next and
hence was it that his face was pale and that he looked all the emotion
which he really felt

This was the aspect and the bearing of a brave but not a reckless man
while Sir Francis Varney on the other hand seemed now that he had
fairly engaged in the duel to look upon it and its attendant
circumstances with a kind of smirking satisfaction as if he were far
more amused than personally interested

This was certainly the more extraordinary after the manner in which he
had tried to evade the fight and at all events was quite a sufficient
proof that cowardice had not been his actuating motive in so doing

The admiral who stood on a level with him could not see the sort of
expression he wore or probably he would have been far from well
pleased but the others did and they found something inexpressibly
disagreeable in the smirking kind of satisfaction with which the vampire
seemed to regard now the proceedings

Confound him whispered Marchdale to Henry one would think he was
quite delighted instead as we had imagined him not well pleased at
these proceedings look how he grins

It is no matter said Henry let him wear what aspect he may it is
the same to me and as Heaven is my judge I here declare if I did not
think myself justified in so doing I would not raise my hand against
this man

There can be no shadow of a doubt regarding your justification Have at
him and Heaven protect you

Amen

The admiral was to give the word to fire and now he and Marshal having
stepped sufficiently on one side to be out of all possible danger from
any stray shot he commenced repeating the signal 

Are you ready gentlemen once

They looked sternly at each other and each grasped his pistol

Twice

Sir Francis Varney smiled and looked around him as if the affair were
one of the most common-place description

Thrice

Varney seemed to be studying the sky rather than attending to the duel

Fire said the admiral and one report only struck upon the ear It
was that from Henry's pistol

All eyes were turned upon Sir Francis Varney who had evidently reserved
his fire for what purpose could not be devised except a murderous one
the taking of a more steady aim at Henry

Sir Francis however seemed in no hurry but smiled significantly and
gradually raised the point of his weapon

Did you hear the word Sir Francis I gave it loud enough I am sure I
never spoke plainer in my life did I ever Jack

Yes often said Jack Pringle what's the use of your asking such
yarns as them you know you have done so often enough when you wanted
grog

You d  d rascal I'll I'll have your back scored I will

So you will when you are afloat again which you never will be you're
paid off that's certain

You lubberly lout you ain't a seaman a seaman would never mutiny
against his admiral howsomever do you hear Sir Francis I'll give the
matter up if you don't pay some attention to me

Henry looked steadily at Varney expecting every moment to feel his
bullet Mr Marchdale hastily exclaimed that this was not according to
usage

Sir Francis Varney took no notice but went on elevating his weapon
when it was perpendicular to the earth he fired in the air

I had not anticipated this said Marchdale as he walked to Henry I
thought he was taking a more deadly aim

And I said Henry

Ay you have escaped Henry let me congratulate you

Not so fast we may fire again

I can afford to do that he said with a smile

You should have fired sir according to custom said the admiral
this is not the proper thing

What fire at your friend

Oh that's all very well You are my friend for a time vampire as you
are and I intend you shall fire

If Mr Henry Bannerworth demands another fire I have no objection to
it and will fire at him but as it is I shall not do so indeed it
would be quite useless for him to do so to point mortal weapons at me
is mere child's play they will not hurt me

The devil they won't said the admiral

Why look you here said Sir Francis Varney stepping forward and
placing his hand to his neckerchief look you here if Mr Henry
Bannerworth should demand another fire he may do so with the same
bullet

The same bullet said Marchdale stepping forward the same bullet
How is this

My eyes said Jack who'd a thought it there's a go Wouldn't he do
for a dummy to lead a forlorn hope or to put among the boarders

Here said Sir Francis handing a bullet to Henry Bannerworth here
is the bullet you shot at me

Henry looked at it it was blackened by powder and then Marchdale
seized it and tried it in the pistol but found the bullet fitted
Henry's weapon

By heavens it is so he exclaimed stepping back and looking at
Varney from top to toe in horror and amazement

D  e said the admiral if I understand this Why Jack Pringle you
dog here's a strange fish

On no there's plenty on um in some countries

Will you insist upon another fire or may I consider you satisfied

I shall object said Marchdale Henry this affair must go no
further it would be madness worse than madness to fight upon such
terms

So say I said the admiral I will not have anything to do with you
Sir Francis I'll not be your second any longer I didn't bargain for
such a game as this You might as well fight with the man in brass
armour at the Lord Mayor's show or the champion at a coronation

Oh said Jack Pringle a man may as well fire at the back of a
halligator as a wamphigher

This must be considered as having been concluded said Mr Marchdale

No said Henry

And wherefore not

Because I have not received his fire

Heaven forbid you should

I may not with honour quit the ground without another fire

Under ordinary circumstances there might be some shadow of an excuse
for your demand but as it is there is none You have neither honour nor
credit to gain by such an encounter and certainly you can gain no
object

How are we to decide this affair Am I considered absolved from the
accusation under which I lay of cowardice inquired Sir Francis
Varney with a cold smile

Why as for that said the admiral I should as soon expect credit
for fighting behind a wall as with a man that I couldn't hit any more
than the moon

Henry let me implore you to quit this scene it can do no good

At this moment a noise as of human voices was heard at a distance
this caused a momentary pause and the whole party stood still and
listened

The murmurs and shouts that now arose in the distance were indistinct
and confused

What can all this mean said Marchdale there is something very
strange about it I cannot imagine a cause for so unusual an
occurrence

Nor I said Sir Francis Varney looking suspiciously at Henry
Bannerworth

Upon my honour I know neither what is the cause nor the nature of the
sounds themselves

Then we can easily see what is the matter from yonder hillock said
the admiral and there's Jack Pringle he's up there already What's he
telegraphing about in that manner I wonder

The fact was Jack Pringle hearing the riot had thought that if he got
to the neighbouring eminence he might possibly ascertain what it was
that was the cause of what he termed the row and had succeeded in
some degree

There were a number of people of all kinds coming out from the village
apparently armed and shouting Jack Pringle hitched up his trousers and
swore then took off his hat and began to shout to the admiral as he
said 

D  e they are too late to spoil the sport Hilloa hurrah

What's all that about Jack inquired the admiral as he came puffing
along What's the squall about

Only a few horse-marines and bumboat-women that have been startled
like a company of penguins

Oh my eyes wouldn't a whole broadside set em flying Jack

Ay just as them Frenchmen that you murdered on board the Big
Thunderer as you called it

I murder them you rascal

Yes there was about five hundred of them killed

They were only shot

They were killed only your conscience tells you it's uncomfortable

You rascal you villain You ought to be keel-hauled and well payed

Ay you're payed and paid off as an old hulk

D  e you you oh I wish I had you on board ship I'd make your
lubberly carcass like a union jack full of red and blue stripes

Oh it's all very well but if you don't take to your heels you'll
have all the old women in the village a whacking on you that's all I
have to say about it You'd better port your helm and about ship or
you'll be keel-hauled

D n your 

What's the matter inquired Marchdale as he arrived

What's the cause of all the noise we have heard said Sir Francis
has some village festival spontaneously burst forth among the rustics
of this place

I cannot tell the cause of it said Henry Bannerworth but they seem
to me to be coming towards this place

Indeed

I think so too said Marchdale

With what object inquired Sir Francis Varney

No peaceable one observed Henry for as far I can observe they
struck across the country as though they would enclose something or
intercept somebody

Indeed but why come here

If I knew that I could have at once told the cause

And they appear armed with a variety of odd weapons observed Sir
Francis they mean an attack upon some one Who is that man with them
he seems to be deprecating their coming

That appears to be Mr Chillingworth said Henry I think that is
he

Yes observed the admiral I think I know the build of that craft
he's been in our society before I always know a ship as soon as I see
it

Does you though said Jack

Yea what do you mean eh let me hear what you've got to say against
your captain and your admiral you mutinous dog you tell me I say

So I will you thought you were fighting a big ship in a fog and fired
a dozen broadsides or so and it was only the Flying Dutchman or the
devil

You infernal dog 

Well you know it was it might a been our own shadow for all I can
tell Indeed I think it was

You think

Yes

That's mutiny I'll have no more to do with you Jack Pringle you're
no seaman and have no respect for your officer Now sheer off or I'll
cut your yards

Why as for my yards I'll square em presently if I like you old
swab but as for leaving you very well you have said so and you shall
be accommodated d  e however it was not so when your nob was nearly
rove through with a boarding pike it wasn't I'll have no more to do
with Jack Pringle then it was more t'other

Well then why be so mutinous

Because you aggrawates me

The cries of the mob became more distinct as they drew nearer to the
party who began to evince some uneasiness as to their object

Surely said Marchdale Mr Chillingworth has not named anything
respecting the duel that has taken place

No no

But he was to have been here this morning said the admiral I
understood he was to be here in his own character of a surgeon and yet
I have not seen him have any of you

No said Henry

Then here he comes in the character of conservator of the public
peace said Varney coldly however I believe that his errand will be
useless since the affair is I presume concluded

Down with the vampire

Eh said the admiral eh what's that eh What did they say

If you'll listen they'll tell you soon enough I'll warrant

May be they will and yet I'd like to know now

Sir Francis Varney looked significantly at Marchdale and then waited
with downcast eyes for the repetition of the words

Down with the vampire resounded on all sides from the people who came
rapidly towards them and converging towards a centre Burn destroy
and kill the vampire No vampire burn him out down with him kill
him

Illustration

Then came Mr Chillingworth's voice who with much earnestness
endeavoured to exhort them to moderation and to refrain from violence

Sir Francis Varney became very pale agitated he immediately turned and
taking the least notice he made for the wood which lay between him and
his own house leaving the people in the greatest agitation

Mr Marchdale was not unmoved at this occurrence but stood his ground
with Henry Bannerworth the admiral and Jack Pringle until the mob
came very near to them shouting and uttering cries of vengeance and
death of all imaginable kinds that it was possible to conceive against
the unpopular vampire

Pending the arrival of these infuriated persons we will in a few
words state how it was that so suddenly a set of circumstances arose
productive of an amount of personal danger to Varney such as up to
that time had seemed not at all likely to occur

We have before stated there was but one person out of the family of the
Bannerworths who was able to say anything of a positive character
concerning the singular and inexplicable proceedings at the Hall and
that that person was Mr Chillingworth an individual not at all likely
to become garrulous upon the subject

But alas the best of men have their weaknesses and we much regret to
say that Mr Chillingworth so far in this instance forgot that admirable
discretion which commonly belonged to him as to be the cause of the
popular tumult which had now readied such a height

In a moment of thoughtlessness and confidence he told his wife Yes
this really clever man from whom one would not have expected such a
piece of horrible indiscretion actually told his wife all about the
vampire But such is human nature combined with an amount of firmness
and reasoning power that one would have thought to be invulnerable
safeguards we find some weakness which astonishes all calculation

Such was this of Mr Chillingworth's It is true he cautioned the lady
to be secret and pointed to her the danger of making Varney the vampire
a theme for gossip but he might as well have whispered to a hurricane
to be so good as not to go on blowing so as request Mrs Chillingworth
to keep a secret

Of course she burst into the usual fervent declarations of Who was she
to tell Was she a person who went about telling things When did she
see anybody Not she once in a blue moon and then when Mr
Chillingworth went out like the King of Otaheite she invited the
neighbours round about to come to take some tea

Under solemn promises of secrecy sixteen ladies that evening were made
acquainted with the full and interesting particulars of the attack of
the vampire on Flora Bannerworth and all the evidence inculpating Sir
Francis Varney as the blood-thirsty individual

When the mind comes to consider that these sixteen ladies multiplied
their information by about four-and-twenty each we become quite lost in
a sea of arithmetic and feel compelled to sum up the whole by a candid
assumption that in four-and-twenty hours not an individual in the whole
town was ignorant of the circumstances

On the morning before the projected duel there was an unusual commotion
in the streets People were conversing together in little knots and
using rather violent gesticulations Poor Mr Chillingworth he alone
was ignorant of the causes of the popular commotion and so he went to
bed wondering that an unusual bustle pervaded the little market town
but not at all guessing its origin

Somehow or another however the populace who had determined to make a
demonstration on the following morning against the vampire thought it
highly necessary first to pay some sort of compliment to Mr
Chillingworth and accordingly at an early hour a great mob assembled
outside his house and gave three terrific applauding shouts which
roused him most unpleasantly from his sleep and induced the greatest
astonishment at the cause of such a tumult

Oh that artful Mrs Chillingworth too well she knew what was the
matter yet she pretended to be so oblivious upon the subject

Good God cried Mr Chillingworth as he started up in bed what's
all that

All what said his wife

All what Do you mean to say you heard nothing

Well I think I did hear a little sort of something

A little sort of something It shook the house

Well well never mind Go to sleep again it's no business of ours

Yes but it may be though It's all very well to say go to sleep'
That happens to be a thing I can't do There's something amiss

Well what's that to you

Perhaps nothing but perhaps everything

Mr Chillingworth sprang from his bed and began dressing a process
which he executed with considerable rapidity and in which he was much
accelerated by two or three supplementary shouts from the people below

Then in a temporary lull a loud voice shouted 

Down with the vampire down with the vampire

The truth in an instant burst over the mind of Mr Chillingworth and
turning to his wife he exclaimed 

I understand it now You've been gossipping about Sir Francis Varney
and have caused all this tumult

I gossip Well I never Lay it on me it's sure to be my fault I
might have known that beforehand I always am

But you must have spoken of it

Who have I got to speak to about it

Did you or did you not

Who should I tell

Mr Chillingworth was dressed and he hastened down and entered the
street with great desperation He had a hope that he might be enabled to
disperse the crowd and yet be in time to keep his appointment at the
duel

His appearance was hailed with another shout for it was considered of
course that he had come to join in the attack upon Sir Francis Varney
He found assembled a much more considerable mob than he had imagined
and to his alarm he found many armed with all sorts of weapons of
offence

Hurrah cried a great lumpy-looking fellow who seemed half mad with
the prospect of a disturbance Hurrah here's the doctor he'll tell us
all about it as we go along Come on

For Heaven's sake said Mr Chillingworth stop What are you about
to do all of you

Burn the vampire burn the vampire

Hold hold this is folly Let me implore you all to return to your
homes or you will get into serious trouble on this subject

This was a piece of advice not at all likely to be adopted and when the
mob found that Mr Chillingworth was not disposed to encourage and
countenance it in its violence it gave another loud shout of defiance
and moved off through the long straggling streets of the town in a
direction towards Sir Francis Varney's house

It is true that what were called the authorities of the town had become
alarmed and were stirring but they found themselves in such a
frightful minority that it became out of the question for them to
interfere with any effect to stop the lawless proceedings of the
rioters so that the infuriated populace had it all their own way and
in a straggling disorderly-looking kind of procession they moved off
vowing vengeance as they went against Varney the vampire

Hopeless as Mr Chillingworth thought it was to interfere with any
degree of effect in the proceedings of the mob he still could not
reconcile it to himself to be absent from a scene which he now felt
certain had been produced by his own imprudence so he went on with the
crowd endeavouring as he did so by every argument that could be
suggested to him to induce them to abstain from the acts of violence
they contemplated He had a hope too that when they reached Sir
Francis Varney's finding him not within as probably would be the case
as by that time he would have started to meet Henry Bannerworth on the
ground to fight the duel he might induce the mob to return and forego
their meditated violence

And thus was it that urged on by a multitude of persons the unhappy
surgeon was expiating both in mind and person the serious mistakes he
had committed in trusting a secret to his wife

Let it not be supposed that we for one moment wish to lay down a general
principle as regards the confiding secrets to ladies because from the
beginning of the world it has become notorious how well they keep them
and with what admirable discretion tact and forethought this fairest
portion of humanity conduct themselves

We know how few Mrs Chillingworths there are in the world and have but
to regret that our friend the doctor should in his matrimonial
adventure have met with such a specimen




 XL

THE POPULAR RIOT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S DANGER THE SUGGESTION AND ITS
RESULTS


Illustration

Such then were the circumstances which at once altered the whole
aspect of the affairs and from private and domestic causes of very
deep annoyance led to public results of a character which seemed likely
to involve the whole country-side in the greatest possible confusion

But while we blame Mr Chillingworth for being so indiscreet as to
communicate the secret of such a person as Varney the vampire to his
wife we trust in a short time to be enabled to show that he made as
much reparation as it was possible to make for the mischief he had
unintentionally committed And now as he struggled onward apparently
onward first and foremost among the rioters he was really doing all in
his power to quell that tumult which superstition and dread had raised

Human nature truly delights in the marvellous and in proportion as a
knowledge of the natural phenomena of nature is restricted and
unbridled imagination allowed to give the rein to fathomless conjecture
we shall find an eagerness likewise to believe the marvellous to be the
truth

That dim and uncertain condition concerning vampires originating
probably as it had done in Germany had spread itself slowly but
insidiously throughout the whole of the civilized world

In no country and in no clime is there not something which bears a kind
of family relationship to the veritable vampire of which Sir Francis
Varney appeared to be so choice a specimen

The ghoul of eastern nations is but the same being altered to suit
habits and localities and the sema of the Scandinavians is but the
vampire of a more primitive race and a personification of that morbid
imagination which has once fancied the probability of the dead walking
again among the living with all the frightful insignia of corruption
and the grave about them

Although not popular in England still there had been tales told of such
midnight visitants so that Mrs Chillingworth when she had imparted
the information which she had obtained had already some rough material
to work upon in the minds of her auditors and therefore there was no
great difficulty in very soon establishing the fact

Under such circumstances ignorant people always do what they have heard
has been done by some one else before them and in an incredibly short
space of time the propriety of catching Sir Francis Varney depriving
him of his vampire-like existence and driving a stake through his body
became not at all a questionable proposition

Alas poor Mr Chillingworth as well might he have attempted King
Canute's task of stemming the waves of the ocean as that of attempting
to stop the crowd from proceeding to Sir Francis Varney's house

His very presence was a sort of confirmation of the whole affair In
vain he gesticulated in vain he begged and prayed that they would go
back and in vain he declared that full and ample justice should be done
upon the vampire provided popular clamour spared him and he was left
to more deliberate judgment

Those who were foremost in the throng paid no attention to these
remonstrances while those who were more distant heard them not and for
all they knew he might be urging the crowd on to violence instead of
deprecating it

Thus then this disorderly rabble soon reached the house of Sir Francis
Varney and loudly demanded of his terrified servant where he was to be
found

The knocking at the Hall door was prodigious and with a laudable
desire doubtless of saving time the moment one was done amusing
himself with the ponderous knocker another seized it so that until the
door was flung open by some of the bewildered and terrified men there
was no cessation whatever of the furious demands for admittance

Varney the vampire Varney the vampire cried a hundred voices Death
to the vampire Where is he Bring him out Varney the vampire

The servants were too terrified to speak for some moments as they saw
such a tumultuous assemblage seeking their master while so singular a
name was applied to him At length one more bold than the rest
contrived to stammer out 

My good people Sir Francis Varney is not at home He took an early
breakfast and has been out nearly an hour

The mob paused a moment in indecision and then one of the foremost
cried 

Who'd suppose they'd own he was at home He's hiding somewhere of
course let's pull him out

Ah pull him out pull him out cried many voices A rush was made
into the hall and in a very few minutes its chambers were ransacked and
all its hidden places carefully searched with the hope of discovering
the hidden form of Sir Francis Varney

The servants felt that with their inefficient strength to oppose the
proceedings of an assemblage which seemed to be unchecked by all sort of
law or reason would be madness they therefore only looked on with
wonder and dismay satisfied certainly in their own minds that Sir
Francis would not be found and indulging in much conjecture as to what
would be the result of such violent and unexpected proceedings

Mr Chillingworth hoped that time was being gained and that some sort
of indication of what was going on would reach the unhappy object of
popular detestation sufficiently early to enable him to provide for his
own safety

He knew he was breaking his own engagement to be present at the duel
between Henry Bannerworth and Sir Francis Varney and as that thought
recurred to him he dreaded that his professional services might be
required on one side or the other for he knew or fancied he knew that
mutual hatred dictated the contest and he thought that if ever a duel
had taken place which was likely to be attended with some disastrous
result that was surely the one

But how could he leave watched and surrounded as he was by an
infuriated multitude how could he hope but that his footsteps would be
dogged or that the slightest attempt of his to convey a warning to Sir
Francis Varney would not be the means of bringing down upon his head
the very danger he sought to shield him from

In this state of uncertainty then did our medical man remain a prey
to the bitterest reflections and full of the direst apprehensions
without having the slightest power of himself to alter so disastrous a
train of circumstances

Dissatisfied with their non-success the crowd twice searched the house
of Sir Francis Varney from the attics to the basement and then and
not till then did they begin reluctantly to believe that the servants
must have spoken the truth

He's in the town somewhere cried one Let's go back to the town

It is strange how suddenly any mob will obey any impulse and this
perfectly groundless supposition was sufficient to turn their steps back
again in the direction whence they came and they had actually in a
straggling sort of column reached halfway towards the town when they
encountered a boy whose professional pursuit consisted in tending sheep
very early of a morning and who at once informed them that he had seen
Sir Francis Varney in the wood half way between Bannerworth Hall and
his own home

This event at once turned the whole tide again and with renewed
clamours carrying Mr Chillingworth along with them they now rapidly
neared the real spot where probably had they turned a little earlier
they would have viewed the object of their suspicion and hatred

But as we have already recorded the advancing throng was seen by the
parties on the ground where the duel could scarcely have been said to
have been fought and then had Sir Francis Varney dashed into the wood
which was so opportunely at hand to afford him a shelter from his
enemies and from the intricacies of which well acquainted with them as
he doubtless was he had every chance of eluding their pursuit

The whole affair was a great surprise to Henry and his friends when
they saw such a string of people advancing with such shouts and
imprecations they could not for the life of them imagine what could
have excited such a turn out among the ordinarily industrious and quiet
inhabitants of a town remarkable rather for the quietude and steadiness
of its population than for any violent outbreaks of popular feeling

What can Mr Chillingworth be about said Henry to bring such a mob
here has he taken leave of his senses

Nay said Marchdale look again he seems to be trying to keep them
back although ineffectually for they will not be stayed

D  e said the admiral here's a gang of pirates we shall be
boarded and carried before we know where we are Jack

Ay ay sir said Jack

And is that all you've got to say you lubber when you see your
admiral in danger You'd better go and make terms with the enemy at
once

Really this is serious said Henry they shout for Varney Can Mr
Chillingworth have been so mad as to adopt this means of stopping the
duel

Impossible said Marchdale if that had been his intention he could
have done so quietly through the medium of the civil authorities

Hang me exclaimed the admiral if there are any civil authorities
they talk of smashing somebody What do they say Jack I don't hear
quite so well as I used

You always was a little deaf said Jack

What

A little deaf I say

Why you lubberly lying swab how dare you say so

Because you was

You slave-going scoundrel

For Heaven's sake do not quarrel at such a time as this said Henry
we shall be surrounded in a moment Come Mr Marchdale let you and I
visit these people and ascertain what it is that has so much excited
their indignation

Agreed said Marchdale and they both stepped forward at a rapid pace
to meet the advancing throng

The crowd which had now approached to within a short distance of the
expectant little party was of a most motley description and its
appearance under many circumstances would cause considerable
risibility Men and women were mixed indiscriminately together and in
the shouting the latter if such a thing were possible exceeded the
former both in discordance and energy

Every individual composing that mob carried some weapon calculated for
defence such as flails scythes sickles bludgeons &c and this mode
of arming caused them to wear a most formidable appearance while the
passion that superstition had called up was strongly depicted in their
inflamed features Their fury too had been excited by their
disappointment and it was with concentrated rage that they now pressed
onward

The calm and steady advance of Henry and Mr Marchdale to meet the
advancing throng seemed to have the effect of retarding their progress
a little and they came to a parley at a hedge which separated them
from the meadow in which the duel had been fought

You seem to be advancing towards us said Henry Do you seek me or
any of my friends and if so upon what errand Mr Chillingworth for
Heaven's sake explain what is the cause of all this assault You seem
to be at the head of it

Seem to be said Mr Chillingworth without being so You are not
sought nor any of your friends

Who then

Sir Francis Varney was the immediate reply

Indeed and what has he done to excite popular indignation of private
wrong I can accuse him but I desire no crowd to take up my cause or to
avenge my quarrels

Mr Bannerworth it has become known through my indiscretion that Sir
Francis Varney is suspected of being a vampire

Is this so

Hurrah shouted the mob Down with the vampire hurrah where is he
Down with him

Drive a stake through him said a woman it's the only way and the
humanest You've only to take a hedge stake and sharpen it a bit at one
end and char it a little in the fire so as there mayt'n't be no
splinters to hurt and then poke it through his stomach

The mob gave a great shout at this humane piece of advice and it was
some time before Henry could make himself heard at all even to those
who were nearest to him

When he did succeed in so doing he cried with a loud voice 

Hear me all of you It is quite needless for me to inquire how you
became possessed of the information that a dreadful suspicion hangs over
the person of Sir Francis Varney but if in consequence of hearing such
news you fancy this public demonstration will be agreeable to me or
likely to relieve those who are nearest or dearest to me from the state
of misery and apprehension into which they have fallen you are much
mistaken

Hear him hear him cried Mr Marchdale he speaks both wisdom and
truth

If anything pursued Henry could add to the annoyance of vexation
and misery we have suffered it would assuredly be the being made
subjects of every-day gossip and every-day clamour

You hear him said Mr Marchdale

Yes we does said a man but we comes out to catch a vampire for
all that

Oh to be sure said the humane woman nobody's feelings is nothing
to us Are we to be woke up in the night with vampires sucking our
bloods while we've got a stake in the country

Hurrah shouted everybody Down with the vampire where is he

You are wrong I assure you you are all wrong said Mr
Chillingworth imploringly there is no vampire here you see Sir
Francis Varney has not only escaped but he will take the law of all of
you

This was an argument which appeared to stagger a few but the bolder
spirits pushed them on and a suggestion to search the wood having been
made by some one who was more cunning than his neighbours that measure
was at once proceeded with and executed in a systematic manner which
made those who knew it to be the hiding-place of Sir Francis Varney
tremble for his safety

It was with a strange mixture of feeling that Henry Bannerworth waited
the result of the search for the man who but a few minutes before had
been opposed to him in a contest of life or death

The destruction of Sir Francis Varney would certainly have been an
effectual means of preventing him from continuing to be the incubus he
then was upon the Bannerworth family and yet the generous nature of
Henry shrank with horror from seeing even such a creature as Varney
sacrificed at the shrine of popular resentment and murdered by an
infuriated populace

He felt as great an interest in the escape of the vampire as if some
great advantage to himself had been contingent upon such an event and
although he spoke not a word while the echoes of the little wood were
all awakened by the clamorous manner in which the mob searched for their
victim his feelings could be well read upon his countenance

The admiral too without possessing probably the fine feelings of Henry
Bannerworth took an unusually sympathetic interest in the fate of the
vampire and after placing himself in various attitudes of intense
excitement he exclaimed 

D n it Jack I do hope after all the vampire will get the better of
them It's like a whole flotilla attacking one vessel a lubberly
proceeding at the best and I'll be hanged if I like it I should like
to pour in a broadside into those fellows just to let them see it
wasn't a proper English mode of fighting Shouldn't you Jack

Ay ay sir I should

Shiver me if I see an opportunity if I don't let some of those
rascals know what's what

Scarcely had these words escaped the lips of the old admiral than there
arose a loud shout from the interior of the wood It was a shout of
success and seemed at the very least to herald the capture of the
unfortunate Varney

By Heaven exclaimed Henry they have him

God forbid said Mr Marchdale this grows too serious

Bear a hand Jack said the admiral we'll have a fight for it yet
they sha'n't murder even a vampire in cold blood Load the pistols and
send a flying shot or two among the rascals the moment they appear

No no said Henry no more violence at least there has been
enough there has been enough

Even as he spoke there came rushing from among the trees at the corner
of the wood the figure of a man There needed but one glance to assure
them who it was Sir Francis Varney had been seen and was flying before
those implacable foes who had sought his life

He had divested himself of his huge cloak as well as of his low
slouched hat and with a speed which nothing but the most absolute
desperation could have enabled him to exert he rushed onward beating
down before him every obstacle and bounding over the meadows at a rate
that if he could have continued it for any length of time would have
set pursuit at defiance

Bravo shouted the admiral a stern chase is a long chase and I wish
them joy of it d  e Jack did you ever see anybody get along like
that

Ay ay sir

You never did you scoundrel

Yes I did

When and where

When you ran away off the sound

The admiral turned nearly blue with anger but Jack looked perfectly
imperturbable as he added 

You know you ran away after the French frigates who wouldn't stay to
fight you

Ah that indeed There he goes putting on every stitch of canvass
I'll be bound

And there they come said Jack as he pointed to the corner of the
wood and some of the more active of the vampire's pursuers showed
themselves

It would appear as if the vampire had been started from some
hiding-place in the interior of the wood and had then thought it
expedient altogether to leave that retreat and make his way to some
more secure one across the open country where there would be more
obstacles to his discovery than perseverance could overcome Probably
then among the brushwood and trees for a few moments he had been again
lost sight of until those who were closest upon his track had emerged
from among the dense foliage and saw him scouring across the country at
such headlong speed These were but few and in their extreme anxiety
themselves to capture Varney whose precipate and terrified flight
brought a firm conviction to their minds of his being a vampire they
did not stop to get much of a reinforcement but plunged on like
greyhounds in his track

Jack said the admiral this won't do Look at that great lubberly
fellow with the queer smock-frock

Never saw such a figure-head in my life said Jack

Stop him

Ay ay sir

The man was coming on at a prodigious rate and Jack with all the
deliberation in the world advanced to meet him and when they got
sufficiently close together that in a few moments they must encounter
each other Jack made himself into as small a bundle as possible and
presented his shoulder to the advancing countryman in such a way that
he flew off it at a tangent as if he had run against a brick wall and
after rolling head over heels for some distance safely deposited
himself in a ditch where he disappeared completely for a few moments
from all human observation

Don't say I hit you said Jack Curse yer what did yer run against
me for Sarves you right Lubbers as don't know how to steer in course
runs agin things

Bravo said the admiral there's another of them

The pursuers of Varney the vampire however now came too thick and fast
to be so easily disposed of and as soon as his figure could be seen
coursing over the meadows and springing over road and ditch with an
agility almost frightful to look upon the whole rabble rout was in
pursuit of him

By this time the man who had fallen into the ditch had succeeded in
making his appearance in the visible world again and as he crawled up
the bank looking a thing of mire and mud Jack walked up to him with
all the carelessness in the world and said to him 

Any luck old chap

Oh murder said the man what do you mean who are you where am I
what's the matter Old Muster Fowler the fat crowner will set upon me
now

Have you caught anything said Jack

Caught anything

Yes you've been in for eels haven't you

D n

Well it is odd to me as some people can't go a fishing without
getting out of temper Have it your own way I won't interfere with
you and away Jack walked

The man cleared the mud out of his eyes as well as he could and looked
after him with a powerful suspicion that in Jack he saw the very cause
of his mortal mishap but somehow or other his immersion in the not
over limpid stream had wonderfully cooled his courage and casting one
despairing look upon his begrimed apparel and another at the last of
the stragglers who were pursuing Sir Francis Varney across the fields
he thought it prudent to get home as fast he could and get rid of the
disagreeable results of an adventure which had turned out for him
anything but auspicious or pleasant

Mr Chillingworth as though by a sort of impulse to be present in case
Sir Francis Varney should really be run down and with a hope of saving
him from personal violence had followed the foremost of the rioters in
the wood found it now quite impossible for him to carry on such a chase
as that which was being undertaken across the fields after Sir Francis
Varney

His person was unfortunately but ill qualified for the continuance of
such a pursuit and although with the greatest reluctance he at last
felt himself compelled to give it up

In making his way through the intricacies of the wood he had been
seriously incommoded by the thick undergrowth and he had accidentally
encountered several miry pools with which he had involuntarily made a
closer acquaintance than was at all conducive either to his personal
appearance or comfort The doctor's temper though generally speaking
one of the most even was at last affected by his mishaps and he could
not restrain from an execration upon his want of prudence in letting his
wife have a knowledge of a secret that was not his own and the
producing an unlooked for circumstance the termination of which might
be of a most disastrous nature

Tired therefore and nearly exhausted by the exertions he had already
taken he emerged now alone from the wood and near the spot where stood
Henry Bannerworth and his friends in consultation

The jaded look of the surgeon was quite sufficient indication of the
trouble and turmoil he had gone through and some expressions of
sympathy for his condition were dropped by Henry to whom he replied 

Nay my young friend I deserve it all I have nothing but my own
indiscretion to thank for all the turmoil and tumult that has arisen
this morning

But to what possible cause can we attribute such an outrage

Reproach me as much as you will I deserve it A man may prate of his
own secrets if he like but he should be careful of those of other
people I trusted yours to another and am properly punished

Enough said Henry we'll say no more of that Mr Chillingworth
What is done cannot be undone and we had better spend our time in
reflection of how to make the best of what is than in useless
lamentation over its causes What is to be done

Nay I know not Have you fought the duel

Yes and as you perceive harmlessly

Thank Heaven for that

Nay I had my fire which Sir Francis Varney refused to return so the
affair had just ended when the sound of approaching tumult came upon
our ears

Illustration

What a strange mixture exclaimed Marchdale of feelings and passions
this Varney appears to be At one moment acting with the apparent
greatest malignity and another seeming to have awakened in his mind a
romantic generosity which knows no bounds I cannot understand him

Nor I indeed said Henry but yet I somehow tremble for his fate
and I seem to feel that something ought to be done to save him from the
fearful consequences of popular feeling Let us hasten to the town and
procure what assistance we may but a few persons well organised and
properly armed will achieve wonders against a desultory and
ill-appointed multitude There may be a chance of saving him yet from
the imminent danger which surrounds him

That's proper cried the admiral I don't like to see anybody run
down A fair fight's another thing Yard arm and yard arm stink pots
and pipkins broadside to broadside and throw in your bodies if you
like on the lee quarter but don't do anything shabby What do you
think of it Jack

Why I means to say as how if Varney only keeps on sail as he's been
doing that the devil himself wouldn't catch him in a gale

And yet said Henry it is our duty to do the best we can Let us at
once to the town and summons all the assistance in our power Come
on come on

His friends needed no further urging but at a brisk pace they all
proceeded by the nearest footpaths towards the town

It puzzled his pursuers to think in what possible direction Sir Francis
Varney expected to find sustenance or succour when they saw how
curiously he took his flight across the meadows Instead of
endeavouring by any circuitous path to seek the shelter of his own
house or to throw himself upon the care of the authorities of the town
who must to the extent of their power have protected him he struck
across the fields apparently without aim or purpose seemingly intent
upon nothing but to distance his pursuers in a long chase which might
possibly tire them or it might not according to their or his powers of
endurance

We say this seemed to be the case but it was not so in reality Sir
Francis Varney had a deeper purpose and it was scarcely to be supposed
that a man of his subtle genius and apparently far-seeing and
reflecting intellect could have so far overlooked the many dangers of
his position as not to be fully prepared for some such contingency as
that which had just now occurred

Holding as he did so strange a place in society living among men and
yet possessing so few attributes in common with humanity he must all
along have felt the possibility of drawing upon himself popular
violence

He could not wholly rely upon the secrecy of the Bannerworth family
much as they might well be supposed to shrink from giving publicity to
circumstances of so fearfully strange and perilous a nature as those
which had occurred amongst them The merest accident might at any
moment make him the town's talk The overhearing of a few chance words
by some gossiping domestic some ebullition of anger or annoyance by
some member of the family or a communication from some friend who had
been treated with confidence might at any time awaken around him some
such a storm as that which now raged at his heels

Varney the vampire must have calculated this He must have felt the
possibility of such a state of things and as a matter of course
politicly provided himself with some place of refuge

After about twenty minutes of hard chasing across the fields there
could be no doubt of his intentions He had such a place of refuge and
strange a one as it might appear he sped towards it in as direct a line
as ever a well-sped arrow flew towards its mark

That place of refuge to the surprise of every one appeared to be the
ancient ruin of which we have before spoken and which was so well
known to every inhabitant of the county

Truly it seemed like some act of mere desperation for Sir Francis
Varney to hope there to hide himself There remained within of what had
once been a stately pile but a few grey crumbling walls which the
hunted have would have passed unheeded knowing that not for one instant
could he have baffled his pursuers by seeking so inefficient a refuge

And those who followed hard and fast upon the track of Sir Francis
Varney felt so sure of their game when they saw whither he was
speeding that they relaxed in their haste considerably calling loudly
to each other that the vampire was caught at last for he could be
easily surrounded among the old ruins and dragged from amongst its
moss-grown walls

In another moment with a wild dash and a cry of exultation he sprang
out of sight behind an angle formed by what had been at one time one
of the principal supports of the ancient structure

Then as if there was still something so dangerous about him that only
by a great number of hands could he be hoped to be secured the
infuriated peasantry gathered in a dense circle around what they
considered his temporary place of refuge and as the sun which had now
climbed above the tree tops and dispersed in a great measure many of
the heavy clouds of morning shone down upon the excited group they
might have been supposed there assembled to perform some superstitious
rite which time had hallowed as an association of the crumbling ruin
around which they stood

By the time the whole of the stragglers who had persisted in the chase
had come up there might have been about fifty or sixty resolute men
each intent upon securing the person of one whom they felt while in
existence would continue to be a terror to all the weaker and dearer
portions of their domestic circles

There was a pause of several minutes Those who had come the fleetest
were gathering breath and those who had come up last were looking to
their more forward companions for some information as to what had
occurred before their arrival

All was profoundly still within the ruin and then suddenly as if by
common consent there arose from every throat a loud shout of
Down with the vampire down with the vampire

The echoes of that shout died away and then all was still as before
while a superstitious feeling crept over even the boldest It would
almost seem as if they had expected some kind of response from Sir
Francis Varney to the shout of defiance with which they had just greeted
him but the very calmness repose and absolute quiet of the ruin and
all about it alarmed them and they looked the one at the other as if
the adventure after all were not one of the pleasantest description and
might not fall out so happily as they had expected

Yet what danger could there be there were they more than half a
hundred stout strong men to cope with one they felt convinced that he
was completely in their power they knew the ruins could not hide him
and that five minutes time given to the task would suffice to explore
every nook and corner of them

And yet they hesitated while an unknown terror shook their nerves and
seemingly from the very fact that they had run down their game
successfully they dreaded to secure the trophy of the chase

One bold spirit was wanting and if it was not a bold one that spoke at
length he might be complimented as being comparatively such It was one
who had not been foremost in the chase perchance from want of physical
power who now stood forward and exclaimed 

What are you waiting for now You can have him when you like If you
want your wives and children to sleep quietly in their beds you will
secure the vampire Come on we all know he's here why do you hesitate
Do you expect me to go alone and drag him out by the ears

Any voice would have sufficed to break the spell which bound them This
did so and with one accord and yells of imprecation they rushed
forward and plunged among the old walls of the ruin

Less time than we have before remarked would have enabled any one to
explore the tottering fabric sufficient to bring a conviction to their
minds that after all there might have been some mistake about the
matter and Sir Francis Varney was not quite caught yet

It was astonishing how the fact of not finding him in a moment again
roused all their angry feelings against him and dispelled every feeling
of superstitious awe with which he had been surrounded rage gave place
to the sort of shuddering horror with which they had before contemplated
his immediate destruction when they had believed him to be virtually
within their very grasp

Over and over again the ruins were searched hastily and impatiently by
some carefully and deliberately by others until there could be no
doubt upon the mind of every one individual that somehow or somewhere
within the shadow of those walls Sir Francis Varney had disappeared
most mysteriously

Then it would have been a strange sight for any indifferent spectator to
have seen how they shrunk one by one out of the shadow of those ruins
each seeming to be afraid that the vampire in some mysterious manner
would catch him if he happened to be the last within their sombre
influence and when they had all collected in the bright open space
some little distance beyond they looked at each other and at the ruins
with dubious expressions of countenance each no doubt wishing that
each would suggest something of a consolatory or practicable character

What's to be done now said one

Ah that's it said another sententiously I'll be hanged if I
know

He's given us the slip remarked a third

But he can't have given us the slip said one man who was
particularly famous for a dogmatical spirit of argumentation how is it
possible he must be here and I say he is here

Find him then cried several at once

Oh that's nothing to do with the argument he's here whether we find
him or not

One very cunning fellow laid his finger on his nose and beckoned to a
comrade to retire some paces where he delivered himself of the
following very oracular sentiment 

My good friend you must know Sir Francis Varney is here or he isn't

Agreed agreed

Well if he isn't here it's no use troubling our heads any more about
him but otherwise it's quite another thing and upon the whole I
must say that I rather think he is

All looked at him for it was evident he was big with some suggestion
After a pause he resumed 

Now my good friends I propose that we all appear to give it up and
to go away but that some one of us shall remain and hide among the
ruins for some time to watch in case the vampire makes his appearance
from some hole or corner that we haven't found out

Oh capital said everybody

Then you all agree to that

Yes yes

Very good that's the only way to nick him Now we'll pretend to give
it up let's all of us talk loud about going home

They did all talk loud about going home they swore that it was not
worth the trouble of catching him that they gave it up as a bad job
that he might go to the deuce in any way he liked for all they cared
and then they all walked off in a body when the man who had made the
suggestion suddenly cried 

Hilloa hilloa stop stop you know one of us is to wait

Oh ay yes yes yes said everybody and still they moved on

But really you know what's the use of this who's to wait

That was indeed a knotty question which induced a serious
consultation ending in their all with one accord pitching upon the
author of the suggestion as by far the best person to hide in the ruins
and catch the vampire

They then all set off at full speed but the cunning fellow who
certainly had not the slightest idea of so practically carrying out his
own suggestion scampered off after them with a speed that soon brought
him in the midst of the throng again and so with fear in their looks
and all the evidences of fatigue about them they reached the town to
spread fresh and more exaggerated accounts of the mysterious conduct of
Varney the vampire




 XLIV

VARNEY'S DANGER AND HIS RESCUE THE PRISONER AGAIN AND THE
SUBTERRANEAN VAULT


Illustration

We have before slightly mentioned to the reader and not unadvisedly
the existence of a certain prisoner confined in a gloomy dungeon into
whose sad and blackened recesses but few and faint glimmering rays of
light ever penetrated for by a diabolical ingenuity the narrow
loophole which served for a window to that subterraneous abode was so
constructed that let the sun be at what point it might during its
diurnal course but a few reflected beams of light could ever find their
way into that abode of sorrow

The prisoner the same prisoner of whom we before spoke is there
Despair is in his looks and his temples are still bound with those
cloths which seemed now for many days to have been sopped in blood
which has become encrusted in their folds

He still lives apparently incapable of movement How he has lived so
long seems to be a mystery for one would think him scarcely in a state
even were nourishment placed to his lips to enable him to swallow it

It may be however that the mind has as much to do with that apparent
absolute prostration of all sort of physical energy as those bodily
wounds which he has received at the hands of the enemies who have
reduced him to his present painful and hopeless situation

Occasionally a low groan burst from his lips it seems to come from the
very bottom of his heart and it sounds as if it would carry with it
every remnant of vitality that was yet remaining to him

Then he moves restlessly and repeats in hurried accents the names of
some who are dear to him and far away some who may perchance be
mourning him but who know not guess not aught of his present
sufferings

As he thus moves the rustle of a chain among the straw on which he lies
gives an indication that even in that dungeon it has not been
considered prudent to leave him master of his own actions lest by too
vigorous an effort he might escape from the thraldom in which he is
held

The sound reaches his own ears and for a few moments in the deep
impatience of his wounded spirit he heaps malediction on the heads of
those who have reduced him to his present state

But soon a better nature seems to come over him and gentler words fall
from his lips He preaches patience to himself he talks not of revenge
but of justice and in accents of more hopefulness than he had before
spoken he calls upon Heaven to succour him in his deep distress

Then all is still and the prisoner appears to have resigned himself
once more to the calmness of expectation or of despair but hark his
sense of hearing rendered doubly acute by lying so long alone in nearly
darkness and in positive silence detects sounds which to ordinary
mortal powers of perception would have been by far too indistinct to
produce any tangible effect upon the senses

It is the sound of feet on on they come far overhead he hears them
they beat the green earth that sweet verdant sod which he may never
see again with an impatient tread Nearer and nearer still and now
they pause he listens with all the intensity of one who listens for
existence some one comes there is a lumbering noise a hasty footstep
he hears some one labouring for breath panting like a hunted hare his
dungeon door is opened and there totters in a man tall and gaunt he
reels like one intoxicated fatigue has done more than the work of
inebriation he cannot save himself and he sinks exhausted by the side
of that lonely prisoner

The captive raises himself as far as his chains will allow him he
clutches the throat of his enervated visitor

Villain monster vampire he shrieks I have thee now and locked
in a deadly embrace they roll upon the damp earth struggling for life
together

                                   

It is mid-day at Bannerworth Hall and Flora is looking from the
casement anxiously expecting the arrival of her brothers She had seen
from some of the topmost windows of the Hall that the whole
neighbourhood had been in a state of commotion but little did she guess
the cause of so much tumult or that it in any way concerned her

She had seen the peasantry forsaking their work in the fields and the
gardens and apparently intent upon some object of absorbing interest
but she feared to leave the house for she had promised Henry that she
would not do so lest the former pacific conduct of the vampire should
have been but a new snare for the purpose of drawing her so far from
her home as to lead her into some danger when she should be far from
assistance

And yet more than once was she tempted to forget her promise and to
seek the open country for fear that those she loved should be
encountering some danger for her sake which she would willingly either
share with them or spare them

The solicitation however of her brother kept her comparatively quiet
and moreover since her last interview with Varney in which at all
events he had shown some feeling for the melancholy situation to which
he had reduced her she had been more able to reason calmly and to meet
the suggestions of passion and of impulse with a sober judgment

About midday then she saw the domestic party returning that party
which now consisted of her two brothers the admiral Jack Pringle and
Mr Chillingworth As for Mr Marchdale he had given them a polite
adieu on the confines of the grounds of Bannerworth Hall stating that
although he had felt it to be his duty to come forward and second Henry
Bannerworth in the duel with the vampire yet that circumstance by no
means obliterated from his memory the insults he had received from
Admiral Bell and therefore he declined going to Bannerworth Hall and
bade them a very good morning

To all this Admiral Bell replied that he might go and be d  d if he
liked and that he considered him a swab and a humbug and appealed to
Jack Pringle whether he Jack ever saw such a sanctified looking prig
in his life

Ay ay says Jack

This answer of course produced the usual contention which lasted them
until they got fairly in the house where they swore at each other to an
extent that was enough to make any one's hair stand on end until Henry
and Mr Chillingworth interfered and really begged that they would
postpone the discussion until some more fitting opportunity

The whole of the circumstances were then related to Flora who while
she blamed her brother much for fighting the duel with the vampire
found in the conduct of that mysterious individual as regarded the
encounter yet another reason for believing him to be strictly sincere
in his desire to save her from the consequences of his future visits

Her desire to leave Bannerworth Hall consequently became more and more
intense and as the admiral really now considered himself the master of
the house they offered no amount of opposition to the subject but
merely said 

My dear Flora Admiral Bell shall decide in all these matters now We
know that he is our sincere friend and that whatever he says we ought
to do will be dictated by the best possible feelings towards us

Then I appeal to you sir said Flora turning to the admiral

Very good replied the old man then I say 

Nay admiral interrupted Mr Chillingworth you promised me but a
short time since that you would come to no decision whatever upon this
question until you had heard some particulars which I have to relate to
you which in my humble opinion will sway your judgment

And so I did cried the admiral but I had forgotten all about it
Flora my dear I'll be with you in an hour or two My friend the
doctor here has got some sow by the ear and fancies it's the right
one however I'll hear what he has got to say first before we come to
a conclusion So come along Mr Chillingworth and let's have it out
at once

Flora said Henry when the admiral had left the room I can see that
you wish to leave the Hall

I do brother but not to go far I wish rather to hide from Varney
than to make myself inaccessible by distance

You still cling to this neighbourhood

I do I do and you know with what hope I cling to it

Perfectly you still think it possible that Charles Holland may be
united to you

I do I do

You believe his faith

Oh yes as I believe in Heaven's mercy

And I Flora I would not doubt him now for worlds something even now
seems to whisper to me that a brighter sun of happiness will yet dawn
upon us and that when the mists which at present enshroud ourselves
and our fortunes pass away they will disclose a landscape full of
beauty the future of which shall know no pangs

Yes brother exclaimed Flora enthusiastically this after all may
be but some trial grievous while it lasts but yet tending eventually
only to make the future look more bright and beautiful Heaven may yet
have in store for us all some great happiness which shall spring
clearly and decidedly from out these misfortunes

Be it so and may we ever thus banish despair by such hopeful
propositions Lean on my arm Flora you are safe with me Come
dearest and taste the sweetness of the morning air

There was indeed now a hopefulness about the manner in which Henry
Bannerworth spoke such as Flora had not for some weary months had the
pleasure of listening to and she eagerly rose to accompany him into the
garden which was glowing with all the beauty of sunshine for the day
had turned out to be much finer than the early morning had at all
promised it would be

Flora he said when they had taken some turns to and fro in the
garden notwithstanding all that has happened there is no convincing
Mr Chillingworth that Sir Francis Varney is really what to us he
appears

Indeed

It is so In the face of all evidence he neither will believe in
vampires at all nor that Varney is anything but some mortal man like
ourselves in his thoughts talents feelings and modes of life and
with no more power to do any one an injury than we have

Oh would that I could think so

And I but unhappily we have by far too many and too conclusive
evidences to the contrary

We have indeed brother

And though while we respect that strength of mind in our friend which
will not allow him even almost at the last extremity to yield to what
appear to be stern facts we may not ourselves be so obdurate but may
feel that we know enough to be convinced

You have no doubt brother

Most reluctantly I must confess that I feel compelled to consider
Varney as something more than mortal

He must be so

And now sister before we leave the place which has been a home to us
from earliest life let us for a few moments consider if there be any
possible excuse for the notion of Mr Chillingworth to the effect that
Sir Francis Varney wants possession of the house for some purpose still
more inimical to our peace and prosperity than any he has yet
attempted

Has he such an opinion

He has

'Tis very strange

Yes Flora he seems to gather from all the circumstances nothing but
an overwhelming desire on the part of Sir Francis Varney to become the
tenant of Bannerworth Hall

He certainly wishes to possess it

Yes but can you sister in the exercise of any possible amount of
fancy imagine any motive for such an anxiety beyond what he alleges

Which is merely that he is fond of old houses

Precisely so That is the reason and the only one that can be got
from him Heaven only knows if it be the true one

It may be brother

As you say it may but there's a doubt nevertheless Flora I much
rejoice that you have had an interview with this mysterious being for
you have certainty since that time been happier and more composed than
I ever hoped to see you again

I have indeed

It is sufficiently perceivable

Somehow brother since that interview I have not had the same sort of
dread of Sir Francis Varney which before made the very sound of his name
a note of terror to me His words and all he said to me during that
interview which took place so strangely between us indeed how I know
not tended altogether rather to make him to a certain extent an
object of my sympathies rather than my abhorrence

That is very strange

I own that it is strange Henry but when we come for but a brief
moment to reflect upon the circumstances which have occurred we shall
I think be able to find some cause even to pity Varney the vampire

How

Thus brother It is said and well may I who have been subject to an
attack of such a nature tremble to repeat the saying that those who
have been once subject to the visitations of a vampire are themselves
in a way to become one of the dreadful and maddening fraternity

I have heard so much sister replied Henry

Yes and therefore who knows but that Sir Francis Varney may at one
time have been as innocent as we are ourselves of the terrible and
fiendish propensity which now makes him a terror and a reproach to all
who know him or are in any way obnoxious to his attacks

That is true

There may have been a time who shall say there was not when he like
me would have shrunk with a dread as great as any one could have
experienced from the contamination of the touch even of a vampire

I cannot sister deny the soundness of your reasoning said Henry
with a sigh but I still no not see anything even from a full
conviction that Varney is unfortunate which should induce us to
tolerate him

Nay brother I said not tolerate What I mean is that even with the
horror and dread we must naturally feel at such a being we may afford
to mingle some amount of pity which shall make us rather seek to shun
him than to cross his path with a resolution of doing him an injury

I perceive well sister what you mean Rather than remain here and
make an attempt to defy Sir Francis Varney you would fly from him and
leave him undisputed master of the field

I would I would

Heaven forbid that I or any one should thwart you You know well
Flora how dear you are to me you know well that your happiness has
ever been to us all a matter which has assumed the most important of
shapes as regarded our general domestic policy It is not therefore
likely now dear sister that we should thwart you in your wish to
remove from here

I know Henry all you would say remarked Flora as a tear started to
her eyes I know well all you think and in your love for me I
likewise know well I rely for ever You are attached to this place as
indeed we all are by a thousand happy and pleasant associations but
listen to me further Henry I do not wish to wander far

Not far Flora

No Do I not still cling to a hope that Charles may yet appear and if
he do so it will assuredly be in this neighbourhood which he knows is
native and most dear to us all

True

Then do I wish to make some sort of parade in the way of publicity of
our leaving the Hall

Yes yes

And yet not go far In the neighbouring town for example surely we
might find some means of living entirely free from remark or observation
as to who or what we were

That sister I doubt If you seek for that species of solitude which
you contemplate it is only to be found in a desert

A desert

Yes or in a large city

Indeed

Ay Flora you may well believe me that it is so In a small community
you can have no possible chance of evading an amount of scrutiny which
would very soon pierce through any disguise you could by any possibility
assume

Then there is no resource We must go far

Nay I will consider for you Flora and although as a general
principle what I have said I know to be true yet some more special
circumstance may arise that may point a course that while it enables
us for Charles Holland's sake to remain in this immediate
neighbourhood yet will procure to us all the secrecy we may desire

Dear dear brother said Flora as she flung herself upon Henry's
neck you speak cheeringly to me and what is more you believe in
Charles's faithfulness and truth

As Heaven is my judge I do

A thousand thousand thanks for such an assurance I know him too well
to doubt for one moment his faith Oh brother could he could
Charles Holland the soul of honour the abode of every noble impulse
that can adorn humanity could he have written those letters No no
perish the thought

It has perished

Thank God

I only upon reflection wonder how misled for the moment by the
concurrence of a number of circumstances I could ever have suspected
him

It is like your generous nature brother to say so but you know as
well as I that there has been one here who has far from feeling any
sort of anxiety to think as well as possible of poor Charles Holland
has done all that in him lay to take the worst view of his mysterious
disappearance and induce us to do the like

You allude to Mr Marchdale

I do

Well Flora at the same time that I must admit you have cause for
speaking of Mr Marchdale as you do yet when we come to consider all
things there may be found for him excuses

May there

Yes Flora he is a man as he himself says past the meridian of life
and the world is a sad as well as a bad teacher for it soon too soon
alas deprives us of our trusting confidence in human nature

It may be so but yet he knowing as he did so very little of Charles
Holland judged him hastily and harshly

You rather ought to say Flora that he did not judge him generously

Well be it so

And you must recollect when you say so that Marchdale did not love
Charles Holland

Nay now said Flora while there flashed across her cheek for a
moment a heightened colour you are commencing to jest with me and
therefore we will say no more You know dear Henry all my hopes my
wishes and my feelings and I shall therefore leave my future destiny
in your hands to dispose of as you please Look yonder

Where

There Do you not see the admiral and Mr Chillingworth walking among
the trees

Yes yes I do now

How very serious and intent they are upon the subject of their
discourse They seem quite lost to all surrounding objects I could not
have imagined any subject that would so completely have absorbed the
attention of Admiral Bell

Mr Chillingworth had something to relate to him or to propose of a
nature which perchance has had the effect of enchaining all his
attention he called him from the room

Yes I saw that he did But see they come towards us and now we
shall probably hear what is the subject-matter of their discourse and
consultation

We shall

Admiral Bell had evidently seen Henry and his sister for now suddenly
as if not from having for the first moment observed them and in
consequence broken off their private discourse but as if they arrived
at some point in it which enabled them to come to a conclusion to be
communicative the admiral came towards the brother and sister

Well said the bluff old admiral when they were sufficiently near to
exchange words well Miss Flora you are looking a thousand times
better than you were

I thank you admiral I am much better

Oh to be sure you are and you will be much better still and no sort
of mistake Now here's the doctor and I have both been agreeing upon
what is best for you

Indeed

Yes to be sure Have we not doctor

We have admiral

Good and what now Miss Flora do you suppose it is

I really cannot say

Why it's change of air to be sure You must get away from here as
quickly as you can or there will be no peace for you

Yes added Mr Chillingworth advancing I am quite convinced that
change of scene and change of place and habits and people will tend
more to your complete recovery than any other circumstances In the most
ordinary cases of indisposition we always find that the invalid recovers
much sooner away from the scene of his indisposition than by remaining
in it even though its general salubrity be much greater than the place
to which he may be removed

Good said the admiral

Then we are to understand said Henry with a smile that we are no
longer to be your guests Admiral Bell

Belay there cried the admiral who told you to understand any such
thing I should like to know

Well but we shall look upon this house as yours now and that being
the case if we remove from it of course we cease to be your guests any
longer

That's all you know about it Now hark ye You don't command the
fleet so don't pretend to know what the admiral is going to do I have
made money by knocking about some of the enemies of old England and
that's the most gratifying manner in the world of making money so far
as I am concerned

Illustration

It is an honourable mode

Of course it is Well I am going to what the deuce do you call it

What

That's just what I want to know Oh I have it now I am going to what
the lawyers call invest it

A prudent step admiral and one which it is to be hoped before now
has occurred to you

Perhaps it has and perhaps it hasn't however that's my business and
no one's else's I am going to invest my spare cash in taking houses
so as I don't care a straw where the houses may be situated you can
look out for one somewhere that will suit you and I'll take it so
after all you will be my guests there just the same as you are here

Admiral said Henry it would be imposing upon a generosity as rare
as it is noble were we to allow you to do so much for us as you
contemplate

Very good

We cannot we dare not

But I say you shall So you have had your say and I've had mine after
which if you please Master Henry Bannerworth I shall take upon myself
to consider the affair as altogether settled You can commence
operations as soon as you like I know that Miss Flora here bless her
sweet eyes don't want to stay at Bannerworth Hall any longer than she
can help it

Indeed I was urging upon Henry to remove said Flora but yet I
cannot help feeling with him admiral that we are imposing upon your
goodness

Go on imposing then

But 

Psha Can't a man be imposed upon if he likes D n it that's a poor
privilege for an Englishman to be forced to make a row about I tell you
I like it I will be imposed upon so there's an end of that and now
let's come in and see what Mrs Bannerworth has got ready for luncheon

                                   

It can hardly be supposed that such a popular ferment as had been
created in the country town by the singular reports concerning Varney
the vampire should readily and without abundant satisfaction subside

An idea like that which had lent so powerful an impulse to the popular
mind was one far easier to set going than to deprecate or extinguish
The very circumstances which had occurred to foil the excited mob in
their pursuit of Sir Francis Varney were of a nature to increase the
popular superstition concerning him and to make him and his acts appear
in still more dreadful colours

Mobs do not reason very closely and clearly but the very fact of the
frantic flight of Sir Francis Varney from the projected attack of the
infuriated multitude was seized hold of as proof positive of the
reality of his vampire-like existence

Then again had he not disappeared in the most mysterious manner Had
he not sought refuge where no human being would think of seeking refuge
namely in that old dilapidated ruin where when his pursuers were so
close upon his track he had succeeded in eluding their grasp with a
facility which looked as if he had vanished into thin air or as if the
very earth had opened to receive him bodily within its cold embraces

It is not to be wondered at that the few who fled so precipitately from
the ruin lost nothing of the wonderful story they had to tell in the
carrying it from that place to the town When they reached their
neighbours they not only told what had really occurred but they added
to it all their own surmises and the fanciful creation of all their own
fears so that before mid-day and about the time when Henry Bannerworth
was conversing so quietly in the gardens of the Hall with his beautiful
sister there was an amount of popular ferment in the town of which
they had no conception

All business was suspended and many persons now that once the idea had
been started concerning the possibility that a vampire might have been
visiting some of the houses in the place told how in the dead of the
night they had heard strange noises How children had shrieked from no
apparent cause doors opened and shut without human agency and windows
rattled that never had been known to rattle before

Some too went so far as to declare that they had been awakened out of
their sleep by noises incidental to an effort made to enter their
chambers and others had seen dusky forms of gigantic proportions
outside their windows tampering with their fastenings and only
disappearing when the light of day mocked all attempts at concealment

These tales flew from mouth to mouth and all listened to them with such
an eager interest that none thought it worth while to challenge their
inconsistencies or to express a doubt of their truth because they had
not been mentioned before

The only individual and he was a remarkably clever man who made the
slightest remark upon the subject of a practical character hazarded a
suggestion that made confusion worse confounded

He knew something of vampires He had travelled abroad and had heard of
them in Germany as well as in the east and to a crowd of wondering
and aghast listeners he said 

You may depend upon it my friends this has been going on for some
time there have been several mysterious and sudden deaths in the town
lately people have wasted away and died nobody knew how or wherefore

Yes yes said everybody

There was Miles the butcher you know how fat he was and then how fat
he wasn't

A general assent was given to the proposition and then elevating one
arm in an oratorical manner the clever fellow continued 

I have not a doubt that Miles the butcher and every one else who has
died suddenly lately have been victims of the vampire and what's more
they'll all be vampires and come and suck other people's blood till at
last the whole town will be a town of vampires

But what's to be done cried one who trembled so excessively that he
could scarcely stand under his apprehension

There is but one plan Sir Francis Varney must be found and put out of
the world in such a manner that he can't come back to it again and all
those who are dead that we have any suspicion of should be taken up out
of their graves and looked at to see if they're rotting or not if they
are it's all right but if they look fresh and much as usual you may
depend they're vampires and no mistake

This was a terrific suggestion thrown amongst a mob To have caught Sir
Francis Varney and immolated him at the shrine of popular fury they
would not have shrunk from but a desecration of the graves of those
whom they had known in life was a matter which however much it had to
recommend it even the boldest stood aghast at and felt some qualms of
irresolution

There are many ideas however which like the first plunge into a cold
bath are rather uncomfortable for the moment but which in a little
time we become so familiarized with that they become stripped of their
disagreeable concomitants and appear quite pleasing and natural

So it was with this notion of exhuming the dead bodies of those
townspeople who had recently died from what was called a decay of
nature and such other failures of vitality as bore not the tangible
name of any understood disease

From mouth to mouth the awful suggestion spread like wildfire until at
last it grew into such a shape that it almost seemed to become a duty
at all events to have up Miles the butcher and see how he looked

There is too about human nature a natural craving curiosity concerning
everything connected with the dead There is not a man of education or
of intellectual endowment who would not travel many miles to look upon
the exhumation of the remains of some one famous in his time whether
for his vices his virtues his knowledge his talents or his heroism
and if this feeling exist in the minds of the educated and refined in a
sublimated shape which lends to it grace and dignity we may look for
it among the vulgar and the ignorant taking only a grosser and meaner
form in accordance with their habits of thought The rude materials of
which the highest and noblest feelings of educated minds are formed
will be found amongst the most grovelling and base and so this vulgar
curiosity which combined with other feelings prompted an ignorant and
illiterate mob to exhume Miles the once fat butcher in a different
form tempted the philosophic Hamlet to moralise upon the skull of
Yorick

And it was wonderful to see how when these people had made up their
minds to carry out the singularly interesting but at the same
fearful suggestion they assumed to themselves a great virtue in so
doing told each other what an absolute necessity there was for the
public good that it should be done and then with loud shouts and
cries concerning the vampire they proceeded in a body to the village
churchyard where had been lain with a hope of reposing in peace the
bones of their ancestors

A species of savage ferocity now appeared to have seized upon the crowd
and the people in making up their minds to do something which was
strikingly at variance with all their preconceived notions of right and
wrong appeared to feel that it was necessary in order that they might
be consistent to cast off many of the decencies of life and to become
riotous and reckless

As they proceeded towards the graveyard they amused themselves by
breaking the windows of the tax-gatherers and doing what passing
mischief they could to the habitations of all who held any official
situation or authority

This was something like a proclamation of war against those who might
think it their duty to interfere with the lawless proceedings of an
ignorant multitude A public-house or two likewise en route was
sacked of some of its inebriating contents so that what with the
madness of intoxication and the general excitement consequent upon the
very nature of the business which took them to the churchyard a more
wild and infuriated multitude than that which paused at two iron gates
which led into the sanctuary of that church could not be imagined

Those who have never seen a mob placed in such a situation as to have
cast off all moral restraint whatever at the same time that it feels
there is no physical power to cope with it can form no notion of the
mass of terrible passions which lie slumbering under what in ordinary
cases have appeared harmless bosoms but which now run riot and
overcame every principle of restraint It is a melancholy fact but
nevertheless a fact despite its melancholy that even in a civilised
country like this with a generally well-educated population nothing
but a well-organised physical force keeps down from the commission of
the most outrageous offences hundreds and thousands of persons

We have said that the mob paused at the iron gates of the churchyard
but it was more a pause of surprise than one of vacillation because
they saw that those iron gates were closed which had not been the case
within the memory of the oldest among them

At the first building of the church and the enclosure of its graveyard
two pairs of these massive gates had been presented by some munificent
patron but after a time they hung idly upon their hinges ornamental
certainly but useless while a couple of turnstiles to keep cattle
from straying within the sacred precincts did duty instead and
established without trouble the regular thoroughfare which long habit
had dictated as necessary through the place of sepulture

But now those gates were closed and for once were doing duty Heaven
only knows how they had been moved upon their rusty and time-worn
hinges The mob however was checked for the moment and it was clear
that the ecclesiastical authorities were resolved to attempt something
to prevent the desecration of the tombs

Those gates were sufficiently strong to resist the first vigorous shake
which was given to them by some of the foremost among the crowd and
then one fellow started the idea that they might be opened from the
inside and volunteered to clamber over the wall to do so

Hoisted up upon the shoulders of several he grasped the top of the
wall and raised his head above its level and then something of a
mysterious nature rose up from the inside and dealt him such a whack
between the eyes that down he went sprawling among his coadjutors

Now nobody had seen how this injury had been inflicted and the policy
of those in the garrison should have been certainly to keep up the
mystery and leave the invaders in ignorance of what sort of person it
was that had so foiled them Man however is prone to indulge in vain
glorification and the secret was exploded by the triumphant waving of
the long staff of the beadle with the gilt knob at the end of it just
over the parapet of the wall in token of victory

It's Waggles it's Waggles cried everybody it's Waggles the
beadle

Yes said a voice from within it's Waggles the beadle and he
thinks as he had yer there rather try it again The church isn't in
danger oh no What do you think of this

The staff was flourished more vigorously than ever and in the secure
position that Waggles occupied it seemed not only impossible to attack
him but that he possessed wonderful powers of resistance for the staff
was long and the knob was heavy

It was a boy who hit upon the ingenious expedient of throwing up a great
stone so that it just fell inside the wall and hit Waggles a great
blow on the head

The staff was flourished more vigorously than ever and the mob in the
ecstasy at the fun which was going on almost forgot the errand which
had brought them

Perhaps after all the affair might have passed off jestingly had not
there been some really mischievous persons among the throng who were
determined that such should not be the case and they incited the
multitude to commence an attack upon the gates which in a few moments
must have produced their entire demolition

Suddenly however the boldest drew back and there was a pause as the
well-known form of the clergyman appeared advancing from the church
door attired in full canonicals

There's Mr Leigh said several how unlucky he should be here

What is this said the clergyman approaching the gates Can I
believe my eyes when I see before me those who compose the worshippers
at this church armed and attempting to enter for the purpose of
violence to this sacred place Oh let me beseech you lose not a
moment but return to your homes and repent of that which you have
already done It is not yet too late listen I pray you to the voice
of one with whom you have so often joined in prayer to the throne of the
Almighty who is now looking upon your actions

This appeal was heard respectfully but it was evidently very far from
suiting the feelings and the wishes of those to whom it was addressed
the presence of the clergyman was evidently an unexpected circumstance
and the more especially too as he appeared in that costume which they
had been accustomed to regard with a reverence almost amounting to
veneration He saw the favourable effect he had produced and anxious to
follow it up he added 

Let this little ebullition of feeling pass away my friends and
believe me when I assure you upon my sacred word that whatever ground
there may be for complaint or subject for inquiry shall be fully and
fairly met and that the greatest exertions shall be made to restore
peace and tranquillity to all of you

It's all about the vampire cried one fellow Mr Leigh how should
you like a vampire in the pulpit

Hush hush can it be possible that you know so little of the works of
that great Being whom you all pretend to adore as to believe that he
would create any class of beings of a nature such as those you ascribe
to that terrific word Oh let me pray of you to get rid of these
superstitions alike disgraceful to yourselves and afflicting to me

The clergyman had the satisfaction of seeing the crowd rapidly thinning
from before the gates and he believed his exhortations were having all
the effect he wished It was not until he heard a loud shout behind him
and upon hastily turning saw that the churchyard had been scaled at
another place by some fifty or sixty persons that his heart sunk within
him and he began to feel that what he had dreaded would surely come to
pass

Even then he might have done something in the way of pacific exertion
but for the interference of Waggles the beadle who spoilt everything




 XLV

THE OPEN GRAVES THE DEAD BODIES A SCENE OF TERROR


Illustration

We have said Waggles spoilt everything and so he did for before Mr
Leigh could utter a word more or advance two steps towards the rioters
Waggles charged them staff in hand and there soon ensued a riot of a
most formidable description

A kind of desperation seemed to have seized the beadle and certainly
by his sudden and unexpected attack he achieved wonders When however
a dozen hands got hold of the staff and it was wrenched from him and
he was knocked down and half-a-dozen people rolled over him Waggles
was not near the man he had been and he would have been very well
content to have lain quiet where he was this however he was not
permitted to do for two or three who had felt what a weighty
instrument of warfare the parochial staff was lifted him bodily from
the ground and canted him over the wall without much regard to whether
he fell on a hard or a soft place on the other side

This feat accomplished no further attention was paid to Mr Leigh who
finding that his exhortations were quite unheeded retired into the
church with an appearance of deep affliction about him and locked
himself in the vestry

The crowd now had entire possession without even the sort of control
that an exhortation assumed over them of the burying-ground and soon
in a dense mass were these desperate and excited people collected round
the well-known spot where lay the mortal remains of Miles the butcher

Silence cried a loud voice and every one obeyed the mandate looking
towards the speaker who was a tall gaunt-looking man attired in a
suit of faded black and who now pressed forward to the front of the
throng

Oh cried one it's Fletcher the ranter What does he do here

Hear him hear him cried others he won't stop us

Yes hear him cried the tall man waving his arms about like the
sails of a windmill Yes hear him Sons of darkness you're all
vampires and are continually sucking the life-blood from each other No
wonder that the evil one has power over you all You're as men who walk
in the darkness when the sunlight invites you and you listen to the
words of humanity when those of a diviner origin are offered to your
acceptance But there shall be miracles in the land and even in this
place set apart with a pretended piety that is in itself most damnable
you shall find an evidence of the true light and the proof that those
who will follow me the true path to glory shall be found here within
this grave Dig up Miles the butcher

Hear hear hear hurra said every body Mr Fletcher's not such a
fool after all He means well

Yes you sinners said the ranter and if you find Miles the
butcher decaying even as men are expected to decay whose mortal
tabernacles are placed within the bowels of the earth you shall gather
from that a great omen and a sign that if you follow me you seek the
Lord but I you find him looking fresh and healthy as if the warm blood
was still within his veins you shall take that likewise as a
signification that what I say to you shall be as the Gospel and that by
coming to the chapel of the Little Boozlehum ye shall achieve a great
salvation

Very good said a brawny fellow advancing with a spade in his hand
you get out of the way and I'll soon have him up Here goes like blue
blazes

The first shovelful of earth he took up he cast over his head into the
air so that it fell in a shower among the mob which of course raised a
shout of indignation and as he continued so to dispose of the
superfluous earth a general row seemed likely to ensue Mr Fletcher
opened his mouth to make a remark and as that feature of his face was
rather a capacious one a descending lump of mould of a clayey
consistency fell into it and got so wedged among his teeth that in
the process of extracting it he nearly brought some of those essential
portions of his anatomy with it

This was a state of things that could not last long and he who had been
so liberal with his spadesful of mould was speedily disarmed and yet he
was a popular favourite and had done the thing so good-humouredly that
nobody touched him Six or eight others who had brought spades and
pickaxes now pushed forward to the work and in an incredibly short
space of time the grave of Miles the butcher seemed to be very nearly
excavated

Work of any kind or nature whatever is speedily executed when done with
a wish to get through it and never perhaps within the memory of man
was a grave opened in that churchyard with such a wonderful celerity
The excitement of the crowd grew intense every available spot from
which a view of the grave could be got was occupied for the last few
minutes scarcely a remark had been uttered and when at last the spade
of one of those who were digging struck upon something that sounded like
wood you might have heard a pin drop and each one there present drew
his breath more shortly than before

There he is said the man whose spade struck upon the coffin

Those few words broke the spell and there was a general murmur while
every individual present seemed to shift his position in his anxiety to
obtain a better view of what was about to ensue

The coffin now having been once found there seemed to be an increased
impetus given to the work the earth was thrown out with a rapidity that
seemed almost the quick result of the working of some machine and those
closest to the grave's brink crouched down and intent as they were
upon the progress of events heeded not the damp earth that fell upon
them nor the frail brittle and humid remains of humanity that
occasionally rolled to their feet

It was indeed a scene of intense excitement a scene which only wanted
a few prominent features in its foreground of a more intellectual and
higher cast than composed the mob to make it a fit theme for a painter
of the highest talent

And now the last few shovelfuls of earth that hid the top of the coffin
were cast from the grave and that narrow house which contained the
mortal remains of him who was so well known while in life to almost
every one then present was brought to the gaze of eyes which never had
seemed likely to have looked upon him again

The cry was now for ropes with which to raise the cumbrous mass but
these were not to be had no one thought of providing himself with such
appliances so that by main strength only could the coffin be raised
to the brink

The difficulty of doing this was immense for there was nothing tangible
to stand upon and even when the mould from the sides was sufficiently
cleared away that the handles of the coffin could be laid hold of they
came away immediately in the grasp of those who did so

But the more trouble that presented itself to the accomplishment of the
designs of the mob the more intent that body seemed upon carrying out
to the full extent their original designs

Finding it quite impossible by bodily strength to raise the coffin of
the butcher from the position in which it had got imbedded by excessive
rains a boy was hastily despatched to the village for ropes and never
did boy run with such speed before for all his own curiosity was
excited in the issue of an adventure that to his young imagination was
appallingly interesting

As impatient as mobs usually are they had not time in this case for
the exercise of that quality of mind before the boy came back with the
necessary means of exerting quite a different species of power against
the butcher's coffin

Strong ropes were slid under the inert mass and twenty hands at once
plied the task of raising that receptacle of the dead from what had been
presumed to be its last resting-place The ropes strained and creaked
and many thought that they would burst asunder sooner than raise the
heavy coffin of the defunct butcher

It is singular what reasons people find for backing their opinion

You may depend he's a vampire said one or it wouldn't be so
difficult to get him out of the grave

Oh there can be no mistake about that said one when did a natural
Christian's coffin stick in the mud in that way

Ah to be sure said another I knew no good would come of his goings
on he never was a decent sort of man like his neighbours and many
queer things have been said of him that I have no doubt are true enough
if we did but know the rights of them

Ah but said a young lad thrusting his head between the two who were
talking if he is a vampire how does he get out of his coffin of a
night with all that weight of mould a top of him

One of the men considered for a moment and then finding no rational
answer occur to him he gave the boy a box on the ear saying 

I should like to know what business that is of yours Boys now-a-days
ain't like the boys in my time they think nothing now of putting their
spokes in grown-up people's wheels just as if their opinions were of
any consequence

Now by a vigorous effort those who were tugging at the ropes succeeded
in moving the coffin a little and that first step was all the
difficulty for it was loosened from the adhesive soil in which it lay
and now came up with considerable facility

There was a half shout of satisfaction at this result while some of the
congregation turned pale and trembled at the prospect of the sight
which was about to present itself the coffin was dragged from the
grave's brink fairly among the long rank grass that flourished in the
churchyard and then they all looked at it for a time and the men who
had been most earnest in raising it wiped the perspiration from their
brows and seemed to shrink from the task of opening that receptacle of
the dead now that it was fairly in their power so to do

Each man looked anxiously in his neighbour's face and several audibly
wondered why somebody else didn't open the coffin

There's no harm in it said one if he's a vampire we ought to know
it and if he ain't we can't do any hurt to a dead man

Oughtn't we to have the service for the dead said one

Yes said the impertinent boy who had before received the knock on the
head I think we ought to have that read backwards

This ingenious idea was recompensed by a great many kicks and cuffs
which ought to have been sufficient to have warned him of the great
danger of being a little before his age in wit

Where's the use of shirking the job cried he who had been so active
in shoveling the mud upon the multitude why you cowardly sneaking set
of humbugs you're half afraid now

Afraid afraid cried everybody who's afraid

Ah who's afraid said a little man advancing and assuming an heroic
attitude I always notice if anybody's afraid it's some big fellow
with more bones than brains

At this moment the man to whom this reproach was more particularly
levelled raised a horrible shout of terror and cried out in frantic
accents 

He's a-coming he's a-coming

The little man fell at once into the grave while the mob with one
accord turned tail and fled in all directions leaving him alone with
the coffin Such a fighting and kicking and scrambling ensued to get
over the wall of the grave-yard that this great fellow who had caused
all the mischief burst into such peals of laughter that the majority of
the people became aware that it was a joke and came creeping back
looking as sheepish as possible

Some got up very faint sorts of laugh and said very good and swore
they saw what big Dick meant from the first and only ran to make the
others run

Very good said Dick I'm glad you enjoyed it that's all My eye
what a scampering there was among you Where's my little friend who was
so infernally cunning about bones and brains

With some difficulty the little man was extricated from the grave and
then oh for the consistency of a mob they all laughed at him those
very people who heedless of all the amenities of existence had been
trampling upon each other and roaring with terror actually had the
impudence to laugh at him and call him a cowardly little rascal and
say it served him right

But such is popularity

Well if nobody won't open the coffin said big Dick I will so here
goes I knowed the old fellow when he was alive and many a time he's
d  d me and I've d  d him so I ain't a-going to be afraid of him
now he's dead We was very intimate you see cos we was the two
heaviest men in the parish there's a reason for everything

Ah Dick's the fellow to do it cried a number of persons there's
nobody like Dick for opening a coffin he's the man as don't care for
nothing

Ah you snivelling curs said Dick I hate you If it warn't for my
own satisfaction and all for to prove that my old friend the butcher
as weighed seventeen stone and stood six feet two and-a-half on his own
sole I'd see you all jolly well 

D  d first said the boy open the lid Dick let's have a look

Ah you're a rum un said Dick arter my own heart I sometimes
thinks as you must be a nevy or some sort of relation of mine
Howsomdever here goes Who'd a thought that I should ever had a look at
old fat and thunder again that's what I used to call him and then he
used to request me to go down below where I needn't turn round to light
my blessed pipe

Hell we know said the boy why don't you open the lid Dick

I'm a going said Dick kim up

He introduced the corner of a shovel between the lid and the coffin and
giving it a sudden wrench he loosened it all down one side

A shudder pervaded the multitude and popularly speaking you might
have heard a pin drop in that crowded churchyard at that eventful
moment

Dick then proceeded to the other side and executed the same manoeuvre

Now for it he said we shall see him in a moment and we'll think we
seed him still

What a lark said the boy

You hold yer jaw will yer Who axed you for a remark blow yer What
do you mean by squatting down there like a cock-sparrow with a pain in
his tail hanging yer head too right over the coffin Did you never
hear of what they call a fluvifium coming from the dead yer ignorant
beast as is enough to send nobody to blazes in a minute Get out of the
way of the cold meat will yer

A what do you say Dick

Request information from the extreme point of my elbow

Dick threw down the spade and laying hold of the coffin-lid with both
hands he lifted it off and flung it on one side

There was a visible movement and an exclamation among the multitude
Some were pushed down in the eager desire of those behind to obtain a
sight of the ghastly remains of the butcher those at a distance were
frantic and the excitement was momentarily increasing

They might all have spared themselves the trouble for the coffin was
empty here was no dead butcher nor any evidence of one ever having
been there not even the grave-clothes the only thing at all in the
receptacle of the dead was a brick

Dick's astonishment was so intense that his eyes and mouth kept opening
together to such an extent that it seemed doubtful when they would
reach their extreme point of elongation He then took up the brick and
looked at it curiously and turned it over and over examined the ends
and the sides with a critical eye and at length he said 

Well I'm blowed here's a transmogrification he's consolidified
himself into a blessed brick my eye here's a curiosity

But you don't mean to say that's the butcher Dick said the boy

Dick reached over and gave him a tap on the head with the brick

There he said that's what I calls occular demonstration Do you
believe it now you blessed infidel What's more natural He was an
out-and-out brick while he was alive and he's turned to a brick now
he's dead

Give it to me Dick said the boy I should like to have that brick
just for the fun of the thing

I'll see you turned into a pantile first I sha'n't part with this
here it looks so blessed sensible it's a gaining on me every minute as
a most remarkable likeness d  d if it ain't

By this time the bewilderment of the mob had subsided now that there
was no dead butcher to look upon they fancied themselves most
grievously injured and somehow or other Dick notwithstanding all his
exertions in their service was looked upon in the light of a showman
who had promised some startling exhibition and then had disappointed his
auditors

The first intimation he had of popular vengeance was a stone thrown at
him but Dick's eye happened to be upon the fellow who threw it and
collaring him in a moment he dealt him a cuff on the side of the head
which confused his faculties for a week

Hark ye he then cried with a loud voice don't interfere with me
you know it won't go down There's something wrong here and as one of
yourselves I'm as much interested in finding out what it is as any of
you can possibly be There seems to be some truth in this vampire
business our old friend the butcher you see is not in his grave
where is he then

The mob looked at each other and none attempted to answer the question

Why of course he's a vampire said Dick and you may all of you
expect to see him in turn come into your bed-room windows with a
burst and lay hold of you like a million and a half of leeches rolled
into one

There was a general expression of horror and then Dick continued 

You'd better all of you go home I shall have no hand in pulling up any
more of the coffins this is a dose for me Of course you can do what
you like

Illustration

Pull them all up cried a voice pull them all up Let's see how many
vampires there are in the churchyard

Well it's no business of mine said Dick but I wouldn't if I was
you

You may depend said one that Dick knows something about it or he
wouldn't take it so easy

Ah down with him said the man who had received the box on the ears
he's perhaps a vampire himself

The mob made a demonstration towards him but Dick stood his ground and
they paused again

Now you're a cowardly set he said cause you're disappointed you
want to come upon me Now I'll just show what a little thing will
frighten you all again and I warn beforehand it will so you sha'n't
say you didn't know it and were taken by surprise

The mob looked at him wondering what he was going to do

Once twice thrice he said and then he flung the brick up into the
air an immense height and shouted heads in a loud tone

A general dispersion of the crowd ensued and the brick fell in the
centre of a very large circle indeed

There you are again said Dick why what a nice act you are

What fun said the boy It's a famous coffin this Dick and he
laid himself down in the butcher's last resting-place I never was in a
coffin before it's snug enough

Ah you're a rum un said Dick you're such a inquiring genius you
is you'll get your head into some hole one day and not be able to get
it out again and then I shall see you a kicking Hush lay still don't
say anything

Good again said the boy what shall I do

Give a sort of a howl and a squeak when they've all come back again

Won't I said the boy pop on the lid

There you are said Dick d  d if I don't adopt you and bring you
up to the science of nothing

Now listen to me good people all added Dick I have really got
something to say to you

At this intimation the people slowly gathered again round the grave

Listen said Dick solemnly it strikes me there's some tremendous do
going on

Yes there is said several who were foremost

It won't be long before you'll all of you be most d nably astonished
but let me beg of all you not to accuse me of having anything to do with
it provided I tell you all I know

No Dick we won't we won't we won't

Good then listen I don't know anything but I'll tell you what I
think and that's as good I don't think that this brick is the butcher
but I think that when you least expect it hush come a little closer

Yes yes we are closer

Well then I say when you all least expect it and when you ain't
dreaming of such a thing you'll hear something of my fat friend as is
dead and gone that will astonish you all

Dick paused and he gave the coffin a slight kick as intimation to the
boy that he might as well be doing his part in the drama upon which
that ingenious young gentleman set up such a howl that even Dick
jumped so unearthly did it sound within the confines of that receptacle
of the dead

But if the effect upon him was great what must it have been upon those
whom it took completely unawares For a moment or two they seemed
completely paralysed and then they frightened the boy for the shout of
terror that rose from so many throats at once was positively alarming

This jest of Dick's was final for before three minutes had elapsed
the churchyard was clear of all human occupants save himself and the
boy who had played his part so well in the coffin

Get out said Dick it's all right we've done em at last and now
you may depend upon it they won't be in a hurry to come here again You
keep your own counsel or else somebody will serve you out for this I
don't think you're altogether averse to a bit of fun and if you keep
yourself quiet you'll have the satisfaction of hearing what's said
about this affair in every pot-house in the village and no mistake




 XLVI

THE PREPARATIONS FOR LEAVING BANNERWORTH HALL AND THE MYSTERIOUS
CONDUCT OF THE ADMIRAL AND MR CHILLINGWORTH


Illustration

It seemed now that by the concurrence of all parties Bannerworth Hall
was to be abandoned and notwithstanding Henry was loth as he had
indeed from the first shown himself to leave the ancient abode of his
race yet as not only Flora but the admiral and his friend Mr
Chillingworth seemed to be of opinion that it would be a prudent course
to adopt he felt that it would not become him to oppose the measure

He however now made his consent to depend wholly upon the full and
free acquiescence of every member of the family

If he said there be any among us who will say to me Continue to
keep open the house in which we have passed so many happy hours and let
the ancient home of our race still afford a shelter to us I shall feel
myself bound to do so but if both my mother and my brother agree to a
departure from it and that its hearth shall be left cold and desolate
be it so I will not stand in the way of any unanimous wish or
arrangement

We may consider that then as settled said the admiral for I have
spoken to your brother and he is of our opinion Therefore my boy we
may all be off as soon as we can conveniently get under weigh

But my mother

Oh there I don't know You must speak to her yourself I never if I
can help it interfere with the women folks

If she consent then I am willing

Will you ask her

I will not ask her to leave because I know then what answer she
would at once give but she shall hear the proposition and I will leave
her to decide upon it unbiased in her judgment by any stated opinion of
mine upon the matter

Good That'll do and the proper way to put it too There's no mistake
about that I can tell you

Henry although he went through the ceremony of consulting his mother
had no sort of doubt before he did so that she was sufficiently aware of
the feelings and wishes of Flora to be prepared to yield a ready assent
to the proposition of leaving the Hall

Moreover Mr Marchdale had from the first been an advocate of such a
course of proceeding and Henry well knew how strong an influence he had
over Mrs Bannerworth's mind in consequence of the respect in which she
held him as an old and valued friend

He was therefore prepared for what his mother said which was 

My dear Henry you know that the wishes of my children since they have
been grown up and capable of coming to a judgment for themselves have
ever been laws to me If you among you all agree to leave this place
do so

But will you leave it freely mother

Most freely I go with you all what is it that has made this house and
all its appurtenances pleasant in my eyes but the presence in it of
those who are so dear to me If you all leave it you take with you the
only charms it ever possessed so it becomes in itself as nothing I am
quite ready to accompany you all anywhere so that we do but keep
together

Then mother we may consider that as settled

As you please

'It's scarcely as I please I must confess that I would fain have clung
with a kind of superstitious reverence to this ancient abiding-place of
my race but it may not be so Those perchance who are more
practically able to come to correct conclusions in consequence of their
feelings not being sufficiently interested to lead them astray have
decided otherwise and therefore I am content to leave

Do not grieve at it Henry There has hung a cloud of misfortune over
us all since the garden of this house became the scene of an event which
we can none of us remember but with terror and shuddering

Two generations of our family must live and die before the remembrance
of that circumstance can be obliterated But we will think of it no
more

There can no doubt but that the dreadful circumstance to which both Mrs
Bannerworth and Henry alluded was the suicide of the father of the
family in the gardens which before has been hinted at in the course of
this narration as being a circumstance which had created a great
sensation at the time and cast a great gloom for many months over the
family

The reader will doubtless too recollect that at his last moments
this unhappy individual was said to have uttered some incoherent words
about some hidden money and that the rapid hand of death alone seemed
to prevent him from being explicit upon that subject and left it merely
a matter of conjecture

As years had rolled on this affair even as a subject of speculation
had ceased to occupy the minds of any of the Bannerworth family and
several of their friends among whom was Mr Marchdale were decidedly
of opinion that the apparently pointed and mysterious words uttered
were but the disordered wanderings of an intellect already hovering on
the confines of eternity

Indeed far from any money of any amount being a disturbance to the
last moments of the dissolute man whose vices and extravagances had
brought his family to such ruin it was pretty generally believed that
he had committed suicide simply from a conviction of the impossibility
of raising any more supplies of cash to enable him to carry on the
career which he had pursued for so long

But to resume

Henry at once communicated to the admiral what his mother had said and
then the whole question regarding the removal being settled in the
affirmative nothing remained to be done but to set about it as quickly
as possible

The Bannerworths lived sufficiently distant from the town to be out of
earshot of the disturbances which were then taking place and so
completely isolated were they from all sort of society that they had no
notion of the popular disturbance which Varney the vampire had given
rise to

It was not until the following morning that Mr Chillingworth who had
been home in the meantime brought word of what had taken place and
that great commotion was still in the town and that the civil
authorities finding themselves by far too weak to contend against the
popular will had sent for assistance to a garrison town some twenty
miles distant

It was a great grief to the Bannerworth family to hear these tidings
not that they were in any way except as victims accessory to creating
the disturbance about the vampire but it seemed to promise a kind of
notoriety which they might well shrink from and which they were just
the people to view with dislike

View the matter how we like however it is not to be considered as at
all probable that the Bannerworth family would remain long in ignorance
of what a great sensation they had created unwittingly in the
neighbourhood

The very reasons which had induced their servants to leave their
establishment and prefer throwing themselves completely out of place
rather than remain in so ill-omened a house were sure to be bruited
abroad far and wide

And that perhaps when they came to consider of it would suffice to
form another good and substantial reason for leaving the Hall and
seeking a refuge in obscurity from the extremely troublesome sort of
popularity incidental to their peculiar situation

Mr Chillingworth felt uncommonly chary of telling them all that had
taken place although he was well aware that the proceedings of the
riotous mob had not terminated with the little disappointment at the old
ruin to which they had so effectually chased Varney the vampire but to
lose him so singularly when he got there

No doubt he possessed the admiral with the uproar that was going on in
the town for the latter did hint a little of it to Henry Bannerworth

Hilloa he said to Henry as he saw him walking in the garden it
strikes me if you and your ship's crew continue in these latitudes
you'll get as notorious as the Flying Dutchman in the southern ocean

How do you mean said Henry

Why it's a sure going proverb to say that a nod's as good as a wink
but the fact is it's getting rather too well known to be pleasant
that a vampire has struck up rather a close acquaintance with your
family I understand there's a precious row in the town

Indeed

Yes bother the particulars for I don't know them but hark ye by
to-morrow I'll have found a place for you to go to so pack up the
sticks get all your stores ready to clear out and make yourself scarce
from this place

I understand you said Henry We have become the subject of popular
rumour I've only to beg of you admiral that you'll say nothing of
this to Flora she has already suffered enough Heaven knows do not let
her have the additional infliction of thinking that her name is made
familiar in every pothouse in the town

Leave me alone for that said the admiral Do you think I'm an ass

Ay ay said Jack Pringle who came in at that moment and thought the
question was addressed to him

Who spoke to you you bad-looking horse-marine

Me a horse-marine didn't you ask a plain question of a fellow and get
a plain answer

Why you son of a bad looking gun what do you mean by that I tell you
what it is Jack I've let you come sneaking too often on the
quarter-deck and now you come poking your fun at your officers you
rascal

I poking fun said Jack couldn't think of such a thing I should
just as soon think of you making a joke as me

Now I tell you what it is I shall just strike you off the ship's
books and you shall just go and cruise by yourself I've done with
you

Go and tell that to the marines if you like said Jack I ain't done
with you yet for a jolly long watch Why what do you suppose would
become of you you great babby without me Ain't I always a conveying
you from place to place and steering you through all sorts of
difficulties

D -n your impudence

Well then d -n yours

Shiver my timbers

Ay you may do what you like with your own timbers

And you won't leave me

Sartingly not

Come here then

Jack might have expected a gratuity for he advanced with alacrity

There said the admiral as he laid his stick across his shoulders
that's your last month's wages don't spend it all at once

Well I'm d  d said Jack who'd have thought of that he's a
turning rumgumtious and no mistake Howsomdever I must turn it over in
my mind and be even with him somehow I owes him one for that I say
admiral

What now you lubber

Nothing turn that over in your mind and away Jack walked not quite
satisfied but feeling at least that he had made a demonstration of
attack

As for the admiral he considered that the thump he had given Jack with
the stick and it was no gentle one was a decided balancing of accounts
up to that period and as he remained likewise master of the field he
was upon the whole very well satisfied

These last few words which had been spoken to Henry by Admiral Bell
more than any others induced him to hasten his departure from
Bannerworth Hall he had walked away when the altercation between Jack
Pringle and the admiral began for he had seen sufficient of those wordy
conflicts between those originals to be quite satisfied that neither of
them meant what he said of a discouraging character towards the other
and that far from there being any unfriendly feeling contingent upon
those little affairs they were only a species of friendly sparring
which both parties enjoyed extremely

He went direct to Flora and he said to her 

Since we are all agreed upon the necessity or at all events upon the
expediency of a departure from the Hall I think sister the sooner we
carry out that determination the better and the pleasanter for us all it
will be Do you think you could remove so hastily as to-morrow

To-morrow That is soon indeed

I grant you that it is so but Admiral Bell assures me that he will
have everything in readiness and a place provided for us to go to by
then

Would it be possible to remove from a house like this so very quickly

Yes sister If you look around you you will see that a great portion
of the comforts you enjoy in this mansion belong to it as a part of its
very structure and are not removable at pleasure what we really have
to take away is very little The urgent want of money during our
father's lifetime induced him as you may recollect even at various
times to part with much that was ornamental as well as useful which
was in the Hall You will recollect that we seldom returned from those
little continental tours which to us were so delightful without finding
some old familiar objects gone which upon inquiry we found had been
turned into money to meet some more than usually pressing demand

That is true brother I recollect well

So that upon the whole sister there is little to remove

Well well be it so I will prepare our mother for this sudden step
Believe me my heart goes with it and as a force of vengeful
circumstances have induced us to remove from this home which was once
so full of pleasant recollections it is certainly better as you say
that the act should be at once consummated than left hanging in terror
over our minds

Then I'll consider that as settled said Henry

THE REMOVAL FROM THE HALL THE NIGHT WATCH AND THE ALARM


Illustration

Mrs Bannerworth's consent having been already given to the removal she
said at once when appealed to that she was quite ready to go at any
time her children thought expedient

Upon this Henry sought the admiral and told him as much at the same
time adding 

My sister feared that we should have considerable trouble in the
removal but I have convinced her that such will not be the case as we
are by no means overburdened with cumbrous property

Cumbrous property said the admiral why what do you mean I beg
leave to say that when I took the house I took the table and chairs
with it D n it what good do you suppose an empty house is to me

The tables and chairs

Yes I took the house just as it stands Don't try and bamboozle me out
of it I tell you you've nothing to move but yourselves and immediate
personal effects

I was not aware admiral that that was your plan

Well then now you are listen to me I've circumvented the enemy too
often not to know how to get up a plot Jack and I have managed it all
To-morrow evening after dark and before the moon's got high enough to
throw any light you and your brother and Miss Flora and your mother
will come out of the house and Jack and I will lead you where you're to
go to There's plenty of furniture where you're a-going and so you will
get off free without anybody knowing anything about it

Well admiral I've said it before and it is the unanimous opinion of
us all that everything should be left to you You have proved yourself
too good a friend to us for us to hesitate at all in obeying your
commands Arrange everything I pray you according to your wishes and
feelings and you will find there shall be no cavilling on our parts

That's right there's nothing like giving a command to some one person
There's no good done without Now I'll manage it all Mind you seven
o'clock to-morrow evening everything is to be ready and you will all be
prepared to leave the Hall

It shall be so

Who's that giving such a thundering ring at the gate

Nay I know not We have few visitors and no servants so I must e'en
be my own gate porter

Henry walked to the gate and having opened it a servant in a handsome
livery stepped a pace or two into the garden

Well said Henry

Is Mr Henry Bannerworth within or Admiral Bell

Both cried the admiral I'm Admiral Bell and this is Mr Henry
Bannerworth What do you want with us you d  d gingerbread-looking
flunkey

Sir my master desires his compliments his very best compliments and
he wants to know how you are after your flurry

What

After your a a flurry and excitement

Who is your master said Henry

Sir Francis Varney

The devil said the admiral if that don't beat all the impudence I
ever came near Our flurry Ah I like that fellow Just go and tell
him 

No no said Henry interposing send back no message Say to your
master fellow that Mr Henry Bannerworth feels that not only has he no
claim to Sir Francis Varney's courtesy but that he would rather be
without it

Oh ha said the footman adjusting his collar very good This seems
a d  d old-fashioned outlandish place of yours Any ale

Now shiver my hulks said the admiral

Hush hush said Henry who knows but there may be a design in this
We have no ale

Oh ah dem dry as dust by God What does the old commodore say Any
message my ancient Greek

No thank you said the admiral bless you nothing What did you
give for that waistcoat d n you Ha ha you're a clever fellow

Ah the old gentleman's ill However I'll take back his compliments
and that he's much obliged at Sir Francis's condescension At the same
time I suppose may place in my eye what I may get out of either of you
without hindering me seeing my way back Ha ha Adieu adieu

Bravo said the admiral that's it go it now for it D n it it is
a do

The admiral's calmness during the latter part of the dialogue arose from
the fact that over the flunkey's shoulder and at some little distance
off he saw Jack Pringle taking off his jacket and rolling up his
sleeves in that deliberate sort of way that seemed to imply a
determination of setting about some species of work that combined the
pleasant with the useful

Jack executed many nods to and winks at the livery-servant and jerked
his thumb likewise in the direction of a pump near at hand in a manner
that spoke as plainly as possible that John was to be pumped upon

And now the conference was ended and Sir Francis's messenger turned to
go but Jack Pringle bothered him completely for he danced round him in
such a singular manner that turn which way he would there stood Jack
Pringle in some grotesque attitude intercepting him and so he edged
him on till he got him to the pump

Jack said the admiral

Ay ay sir

Don't pump on that fellow now

Ay ay sir give us a hand

Jack laid hold of him by the two ears and holding him under the pump
kicked his shins until he completely gathered himself beneath the spout
It was in vain that he shouted Murder help fire thieves Jack was
inexorable and the admiral pumped

Jack turned the fellow's head about in a very scientific manner so as
to give him a fair dose of hydropathic treatment and in a few minutes
never was human being more thoroughly saturated with moisture than was
Sir Francis Varney's servant He had left off hallooing for aid for he
found that whenever he did so Jack held his mouth under the spout
which was decidedly unpleasant so with a patience that looked like
heroic fortitude he was compelled to wait until the admiral was tired
of pumping

Very good at length he said Now Jack for fear this fellow catcher
cold be so good as to get a horsewhip and see him off the premises
with it

Ay ay sir said Jack And I say old fellow you can take back all
our blessed compliments now and say you've been flurried a little
yourself and if so be as you came here as dry as dust d  e you go
back as wet as a mop Won't it do to kick him out sir

Very well as you please Jack

Then here goes and Jack proceeded to kick the shivering animal from
the garden with a vehemence that soon convinced him of the necessity of
getting out of it as quickly as possible

How it was that Sir Francis Varney after the fearful race he had had
got home again across the fields free from all danger and back to his
own house from whence he sent so cool and insolent a message they
could not conceive

But such must certainly be the fact somehow or another he had escaped
all danger and with a calm insolence peculiar to the man he had no
doubt adopted the present mode of signifying as much to the
Bannerworths

The insolence of his servant was no doubt a matter of pre-arrangement
with that individual however he might have set about it con amore As
for the termination of the adventure that of course had not been at
all calculated upon but like most tools of other people's insolence or
ambition the insolence of the underling had received both his own
punishment and his master's

We know quite enough of Sir Francis Varney to feel assured that he would
rather consider it as a good jest than otherwise of his footman so that
with the suffering he endured at the Bannerworths and the want of
sympathy he was likely to find at home that individual had certainly
nothing to congratulate himself upon but the melancholy reminiscence of
his own cleverness

But were the mob satisfied with what had occurred in the churchyard
They were not and that night was to witness the perpetration of a
melancholy outrage such as the history of the time presents no parallel
to

The finding of a brick in the coffin of the butcher instead of the body
of that individual soon spread as a piece of startling intelligence all
over the place and the obvious deduction that was drawn from the
circumstance seemed to be that the deceased butcher was unquestionably
a vampire and out upon some expedition at the time when his coffin was
searched

How he had originally got out of that receptacle for the dead was
certainly a mystery but the story was none the worse for that Indeed
an ingenious individual found a solution for that part of the business
for as he said nothing was more natural when anybody died who was
capable of becoming a vampire than for other vampires who knew it to
dig him up and lay him out in the cold beams of the moonlight until he
acquired the same sort of vitality they themselves possessed and joined
their horrible fraternity

In lieu of a better explanation and after all it was no bad one this
theory was generally received and with a shuddering horror people
asked themselves if the whole of the churchyard were excavated how
many coffins would be found tenantless by the dead which had been
supposed by simple-minded people to inhabit them

The presence however of a body of dragoons towards evening
effectually prevented any renewed attack upon the sacred precincts of
the churchyard and it was a strange and startling thing to see that
country town under military surveillance and sentinels posted at its
principal buildings

This measure smothered the vengeance of the crowd and insured for a
time the safety of Sir Francis Varney for no considerable body of
persons could assemble for the purpose of attacking his house again
without being followed so such a step was not attempted

It had so happened however that on that very day the funeral of a
young man was to have taken place who had put up for a time at that
same inn where Admiral Bell was first introduced to the reader He had
become seriously ill and after a few days of indisposition which had
puzzled the country practitioners breathed his last

He was to have been buried in the village churchyard on the very day of
the riot and confusion incidental to the exhumation of the coffin of the
butcher and probably from that circumstance we may deduce the presence
of the clergyman in canonicals at the period of the riot

When it was found that so disorderly a mob possessed the churchyard the
idea of burying the stranger on that day was abandoned but still all
would have gone on quietly as regarded him had it not been for the
folly of one of the chamber-maids at the tavern

This woman with all the love of gossip incidental to her class had
from the first entered so fully into all the particulars concerning
vampires that she fairly might be considered to be a little deranged on
that head Her imagination had been so worked upon that she was in an
unfit state to think of anything else and if ever upon anybody a stern
and revolting superstition was calculated to produce direful effects it
was upon this woman

The town was tolerably quiet the presence of the soldiery had
frightened some and amused others and no doubt the night would have
passed off serenely had she not suddenly rushed into the street and
with bewildered accents and frantic gestures shouted 

A vampire a vampire a vampire

These words soon collected a crowd around her and then with screaming
accents which would have been quite enough to convince any reflecting
person that she had actually gone distracted upon that point she
cried 

Come into the house come into the house Look upon the dead body that
should have been in its grave it's fresher now than it was the day on
which it died and there's a colour in its cheeks A vampire a
vampire a vampire Heaven save us from a vampire

The strange infuriated maniacal manner in which these words were
uttered produced an astonishingly exciting effect among the mob
Several women screamed and some few fainted The torch was laid again
to the altar of popular feeling and the fierce flame of superstition
burnt brightly and fiercely

Some twenty or thirty persons with shouts and exclamations rushed into
the inn while the woman who had created the disturbance still continued
to rave tearing her hair and shrieking at intervals until she fell
exhausted upon the pavement

Soon from a hundred throats rose the dreadful cry of A vampire a
vampire The alarm was given throughout the whole town the bugles of
the military sounded there was a clash of arms the shrieks of women
altogether the premonitory symptoms of such a riot as was not likely to
be quelled without bloodshed and considerable disaster

It is truly astonishing the effect which one weak or vicious-minded
person can produce upon a multitude

Here was a woman whose opinion would have been accounted valueless upon
the most common-place subject and whose word would not have passed for
twopence setting a whole town by the ears by force of nothing but her
sheer brutal ignorance

It is a notorious physiological fact that after four or five days or
even a week the bodies of many persons assume an appearance of
freshness such as might have been looked for in vain immediately after
death

It is one of the most insidious processes of that decay which appears to
regret with its

          - offensive fingers To mar the lines where beauty
     lingers

But what did the chamber-maid know of physiology Probably she would
have asked if it was anything good to eat and so of course having her
head full of vampires she must needs produce so lamentable a scene of
confusion the results of which we almost sicken at detailing



 XLVIII

THE STAKE AND THE DEAD BODY


Illustration

The mob seemed from the first to have an impression that as regarded
the military force no very serious results would arise from that
quarter for it was not to be supposed that on an occasion which could
not possibly arouse any ill blood on the part of the soldiery or on
which they could have the least personal feeling they would like to get
a bad name which would stick to them for years to come

It was no political riot on which men might be supposed in consequence
of differing in opinion to have their passions inflamed so that
although the call of the civil authorities for military aid had been
acceded to yet it was hoped and indeed almost understood by the
officers that their operations would lie confined more to a
demonstration of power than anything else

Besides some of the men had got talking to the townspeople and had
heard all about the vampire story and not being of the most refined or
educated class themselves they felt rather interested than otherwise in
the affair

Under these circumstances then we are inclined to think that the
disorderly mob of that inn had not so wholesome a fear as it was most
certainly intended they should have of the redcoats Then again they
were not attacking the churchyard which in the first case was the
main point in dispute and about which the authorities had felt so very
sore inasmuch as they felt that if once the common people found out
that the sanctity of such places could be outraged with impunity they
would lose their reverence for the church that is to say for the host
of persons who live well and get fat in this country by the trade of
religion

Illustration

Consequently this churchyard was the main point of defence and it was
zealously looked to when it need not have been done so while the
public-house where there really reigned mischief was half unguarded

There are always in all communities whether large or small a number of
persons who really have or fancy they have something to gain by
disturbance These people of course care not for what pretext the
public peace is violated so long as there is a row and something like
an excuse for running into other people's houses they are satisfied

To get into a public-house under such circumstances is an unexpected
treat and thus when the mob rushed into the inn with such symptoms of
fury and excitement there went with the leaders of the disturbance a
number of persons who never thought of getting further than the bar
where they attacked the spirit-taps with an alacrity which showed how
great was their love for ardent compounds

Leaving these persons behind however we will follow those who with a
real superstition and a furious interest in the affair of the vampire
made their way towards the upper chamber determining to satisfy
themselves if there were truth in the statement so alarmingly made by
the woman who had created such an emotion

It is astonishing what people will do in crowds in comparison with the
acts that they would be able to commit individually There is usually a
calmness a sanctity a sublimity about death which irresistibly
induces a respect for its presence alike from the educated or from the
illiterate and let the object of the fell-destroyer's presence be whom
it may the very consciousness that death has claimed it for its own
invests it with a halo of respect that in life the individual could
never aspire to probably

Let us precede these furious rioters for a few moments and look upon
the chamber of the dead that chamber which for a whole week had been
looked upon with a kind of shuddering terror that chamber which had
been darkened by having its sources of light closed as if it were a
kind of disrespect to the dead to allow the pleasant sunshine to fall
upon the faded form

And every inhabitant of that house upon ascending and descending its
intricate and ancient staircases had walked with a quiet and subdued
step past that one particular door

Even the tones of voice in which they spoke to each other while they
knew that that sad remnant of mortality was in the house was quiet and
subdued as if the repose of death was but a mortal sleep and could be
broken by rude sounds

Ay even some of these very persons who now with loud and boisterous
clamour had rushed into the place had visited the house and talked in
whispers but then they were alone and men will do in throngs acts
which individually they would shrink from with compunction or
cowardice call it which we will

The chamber of death is upon the second story of the house It is a back
room the windows of which command a view of that half garden half
farm-yard which we find generally belonging to country inns

But now the shutters were closed with the exception of one small
opening that in daylight would have admitted a straggling ray of
light to fall upon the corpse Now however that the sombre shades of
evening had wrapped everything in gloom the room appeared in total
darkness so that the most of those adventurers who had ventured into
the place shrunk back until lights were procured from the lower part of
the house with which to enter the room

A dim oil lamp in a niche sufficiently lighted the staircase and by
the friendly aid of its glimmering beams they had found their way up to
the landing tolerably well and had not thought of the necessity of
having lights with which to enter the apartments until they found them
in utter darkness

These requisites however were speedily procured from the kitchen of
the inn Indeed anything that was wanted was laid hold of without the
least word of remark to the people of the place as if might from that
evening forthwith was understood to constitute right in that town

Up to this point no one had taken a very prominent part in the attack
upon the inn if attack it could be called but now the man whom chance
or his own nimbleness made the first of the throng assumed to himself
a sort of control over his companions and turning to them he said 

Hark ye my friends we'll do everything quietly and properly so I
think we'd better three or four of us go in at once arm-in-arm

Psha cried one who had just arrived with a light it's your
cowardice that speaks I'll go in first let those follow me who like
and those who are afraid may remain where they are

He at once dashed into the room and this immediately broke the spell of
fear which was beginning to creep over the others in consequence of the
timid suggestion of the man who up to that moment had been first and
foremost in the enterprise

In an instant the chamber was half filled with persons four or five of
whom carried lights so that as it was not of very large dimensions it
was sufficiently illuminated for every object in it to be clearly
visible

There was the bed smooth and unruffled as if waiting for some expected
guest while close by its side a coffin supported upon tressles over
which a sheet was partially thrown contained the sad remains of him who
little expected in life that after death he should be stigmatised as
an example of one of the ghastliest superstitions that ever found a home
in the human imagination

It was evident that some one had been in the room and that this was the
woman whose excited fancy had led her to look upon the face of the
corpse there could be no doubt for the sheet was drawn aside just
sufficiently to discover the countenance

The fact was that the stranger was unknown at the inn or probably ere
this the coffin lid would have been screwed on but it was hoped up to
the last moment as advertisements had been put into the county papers
that some one would come forward to identify and claim him

Such however had not been the case and so his funeral had been
determined upon

The presence of so many persons at once effectually prevented any
individual from exhibiting even if he felt any superstitious fears
about approaching the coffin and so with one accord they surrounded
it and looked upon the face of the dead

There was nothing repulsive in that countenance The fact was that
decomposition had sufficiently advanced to induce a relaxation of the
muscles and a softening of the fibres so that an appearance of
calmness and repose had crept over the face which it did not wear
immediately after death

It happened too that the face was full of flesh for the death had
been sudden and there had not been that wasting away of the muscles and
integuments which makes the skin cling as it were to the bone when
the ravages of long disease have exhausted the physical frame

There was unquestionably a plumpness a freshness and a sort of
vitality about the countenance that was remarkable

For a few moments there was a death-like stillness in the apartment and
then one voice broke the silence by exclaiming 

He's a vampire and has come here to die Well he knows he'd be taken
up by Sir Francis Varney and become one of the crew

Yes yes cried several voices at once a vampire a vampire

Hold a moment cried one let us find somebody in the house who has
seen him some days ago and then we can ascertain if there's any
difference in his looks

This suggestion was agreed to and a couple of stout men ran down
stairs and returned in a few moments with a trembling waiter whom they
had caught in the passage and forced to accompany them

This man seemed to think that he was to be made a dreadful example of in
some sort of way and as he was dragged into the room he trembled and
looked as pale as death

What have I done gentlemen he said I ain't a vampire Don't be
driving a stake through me I assure you gentlemen I'm only a waiter
and have been for a matter of five-and-twenty years

You'll be done no harm to said one of his captors you've only got
to answer a question that will be put to you

Oh well certainly gentlemen anything you please Coming coming as
I always say give your orders the waiter's in the room

Look upon the fare of that corpse

Certainly certainly directly

Have you ever seen it before

Seen it before Lord bless you yes a dozen of times I seed him afore
he died and I seed him arter and when the undertaker's men came I
came up with them and I seed em put him in his coffin You see I kept
an eye on em gentlemen cos knows well enough what they is A cousin
of mine was in the trade and he assures me as one of em always brings
a tooth-drawing concern in his pocket and looks in the mouth of the
blessed corpse to see if there's a blessed tooth worth pulling out

Hold your tongue said one we want none of your nonsense Do you see
any difference now in the face of the corpse to what it was some days
since

Well I don't know somehow it don't look so rum

Does it look fresher

Well somehow or another now you mention it it's very odd but it
does

Enough cried the man who had questioned him with considerable
excitement of manner Neighbours are we to have our wives and our
children scared to death by vampires

No no cried everybody

Is not this then one of that dreadful order of beings

Yes yes what's to be done

Drive a stake through the body and so prevent the possibility of
anything in the shape of a restoration

This was a terrific proposition and even those who felt most strongly
upon the subject and had their fears most awakened shrank from
carrying it into effect Others again applauded it although they
determined in their own minds to keep far enough off from the
execution of the job which they hoped would devolve upon others so
that they might have all the security of feeling that such a process had
been gone through with the supposed vampire without being in any way
committed by the dreadful act

Nothing was easier than to procure a stake from the garden in the rear
of the premises but it was one thing to have the means at hand of
carrying into effect so dreadful a proposition and another actually to
do it

For the credit of human nature we regret that even then when
civilisation and popular education had by no means made such rapid
strides as in our times they have such a proposition should be
entertained for a moment but so it was and just as an alarm was given
that a party of the soldiers had reached the inn and had taken
possession of the doorway with a determination to arrest the rioters a
strong hedge-stake had been procured and everything was in readiness
for the perpetration of the horrible deed

Even then those in the room for they were tolerably sober would have
revolted probably from the execution of so fearful an act but the
entrance of a party of the military into the lower portion of the
tavern induced those who had been making free with the strong liquors
below to make a rush up-stairs to their companions with the hope of
escaping detection of the petty larceny if they got into trouble on
account of the riot

These persons infuriated by drink were capable of anything and to
them accordingly the more sober parties gladly surrendered the
disagreeable job of rendering the supposed vampire perfectly innoxious
by driving a hedge-stake through his body a proceeding which it was
currently believed inflicted so much physical injury to the frame as
to render his resuscitation out of the question

The cries of alarm from below joined now to the shouts of those mad
rioters produced a scene of dreadful confusion

We cannot for we revolt at the office describe particularly the
dreadful outrage which was committed upon the corpse suffice it that
two or three maddened by drink and incited by the others plunged the
hedge-stake through the body and there left it a sickening and
horrible spectacle to any one who might cast his eyes upon it

With such violence had the frightful and inhuman deed been committed
that the bottom of the coffin was perforated by the stake so that the
corpse was actually nailed to its last earthly tenement

Some asserted that at that moment an audible groan came from the dead
man and that this arose from the extinguishment of that remnant of life
which remained in him on account of his being a vampire and which
would have been brought into full existence if the body had been placed
in the rays of the moon when at its full according to the popular
superstition upon that subject

Others again were quite ready to swear that at the moment the stake
was used there was a visible convulsion of all the limbs and that the
countenance before so placid and so calm became immediately distorted
as if with agony

But we have done with these horrible surmises the dreadful deed has
been committed and wild ungovernable superstition has had for a time
its sway over the ignorant and debased




 XLIX

THE MOB'S ARRIVAL AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S THE ATTEMPT TO GAIN
ADMISSION


Illustration

The soldiery had been sent for from their principal station near the
churchyard and had advanced with some degree of reluctance to quell
what they considered as nothing better nor worse than a drunken brawl at
a public-house which they really considered they ought not to be called
to interfere with

When however the party reached the spot and heard what a confusion
there was and saw in what numbers the rioters were assembling it
became evident to them that the case was of a more serious complexion
than they had at first imagined and consequently they felt that their
professional dignity was not so much compromised with their interference
with the lawless proceedings

Some of the constabulary of the town were there and to them the
soldiers promised they would hand what prisoners they took at the same
time that they made a distinct condition that they were not to be
troubled with their custody nor in any way further annoyed in the
business beyond taking care that they did not absolutely escape after
being once secured

This was all that the civil authorities of the town required and in
fact they hoped that after making prisoners of a few of the
ringleaders of the riotous proceedings the rest would disperse and
prevent the necessity of capturing them

Be it known however that both military and civil authorities were
completely ignorant of the dreadful outrage against all common decency
which had been committed within the public-house

The door was well guarded and the question now was how the rioters were
to be made to come down stairs and be captured and this was likely to
remain a question so long as no means were adopted to make them
descend So that after a time it was agreed that a couple of troopers
should march up stairs with a constable to enable him to secure any one
who seemed a principal in the riot

But this only had the effect of driving those who were in the
second-floor and saw the approach of the two soldiers whom they
thought were backed by the whole of their comrades up a narrow
staircase to a third-floor rather consisting of lofts than of actual
rooms but still for the time it was a refuge and owing to the
extreme narrowness of the approach to it which consisted of nearly a
perpendicular staircase with any degree of tact or method it might
have been admirably defended

In the hurry and scramble all the lights were left behind and when the
two soldiers and constables entered the room where the corpse had lain
they became for the first time aware of what a horrible purpose had
been carried out by the infuriated mob

The sight was one of perfect horror and hardened to scenes which might
strike other people as being somewhat of the terrific as these soldiers
might be supposed to be by their very profession they actually sickened
at the sight which the mutilated corpse presented and turned aside with
horror

These feelings soon gave way to anger and animosity against the crowd
who could be guilty of such an atrocious outrage and for the first
time a strong and interested vengeance against the mob pervaded the
breasts of those who were brought to act against it

One of the soldiers ran down stairs to the door and reported the scene
which was to be seen above A determination was instantly come to to
capture as many as possible of those who had been concerned in so
diabolical an outrage and leaving a guard of five men at the door the
remainder of the party ascended the staircase determined upon storming
the last refuge of the rioters and dragging them to justice

The report however of these proceedings that were taking place at the
inn spread quickly over the whole town and soon as large a mob of the
disorderly and the idle as the place could at all afford was assembled
outside the inn

This mob appeared for a time inertly to watch the proceedings It
seemed rather a hazardous thing to interfere with the soldiers whose
carbines look formidable and troublesome weapons

With true mob courage therefore they left the minority of their
comrades who were within the house to their fate and after a
whispered conference from one to the other they suddenly turned in a
body and began to make for the outskirts of the town

They then separated as if by common consent and straggled out into the
open country by twos and threes consolidating again into a mass when
they had got some distance off and clear of any exertions that could be
made by the soldiery to stay them

The cry then rose of Down with Sir Francis Varney slay him burn his
house death to all vampires and at a rapid pace they proceeded in
the direction of his mansion

We will leave this mob however for the present and turn our attention
to those who are at the inn and are certainly in a position of some
jeopardy Their numbers were not great and they were unarmed
certainly their best chance would have been to have surrendered at
discretion but that was a measure which if the sober ones had felt
inclined to those who were infuriated and half maddened with drink
would not have acceded to on any account

A furious resistance was therefore fairly to be expected and what
means the soldiery were likely to use for the purpose of storming this
last retreat was a matter of rather anxious conjecture

In the case of a regular enemy there would not perhaps have been much
difficulty but here the capture of certain persons and not their
destruction was the object and how that was to be accomplished by fair
means certainly was a question which nobody felt very competent to
solve

Determination however will do wonders and although the rioters
numbered over forty notwithstanding all their desertions and not above
seventeen or eighteen soldiers marched into the inn we shall perceive
that they succeeded in accomplishing their object without any
manoeuvring at all

The space in which the rioters were confined was low narrow and
inconvenient as well as dark for the lights on the staircase cast up
that height but very insufficient rays

Weapons of defence they found but very few and yet there were some
which to do them but common credit they used as effectually as
possible

These attics or lofts were used as lumber-rooms and had been so for
years so that there was a collection of old boxes broken pieces of
furniture and other matters which will in defiance of everything and
everybody collect in a house

These were formidable means of defence if not of offence down a very
narrow staircase had they been used with judgment

Some of the rioters who were only just drunk enough to be fool-hardy
collected a few of these articles at the top of the staircase and swore
they would smash anybody who should attempt to come up to them a threat
easier uttered than executed

And besides after all if their position had been ever so impregnable
they must come down eventually or be starved out

But the soldiers were not at liberty to adopt so slow a process of
overcoming their enemy and up the second-floor staircase they went
with a determination of making short work of the business

They paused a moment by word of command on the landing and then
after this slight pause the word was given to advance

Now when men will advance in spite of anything and everything it is no
easy matter to stop them and he who was foremost among the military
would as soon thought of hesitating to ascend the narrow staircase
before him when ordered so to do as paying the national debt On he
went and down came a great chest which falling against his feet
knocked him down as he attempted to scramble over it

Fire said the officer and it appeared that he had made some
arrangements as to how the order was to be obeyed for the second man
fired his carbine and then scrambled over his prostrate comrade after
which he stooped and the third fired his carbine likewise and then
hurried forward in the same manner

At the first sound of the fire arms the rioters were taken completely by
surprise they had not had the least notion of affairs getting to such a
length The smell of the powder the loud report and the sensation of
positive danger that accompanied these phenomena alarmed them most
terrifically so that in point of fact with the exception of the empty
chest that was thrown down in the way of the first soldier no further
idea of defence seemed in any way to find a place in the hearts of the
besieged

They scrambled one over the other in their eagerness to get as far as
possible from immediate danger which of course they conceived existed
in the most imminent degree the nearest to the door

Such was the state of terror into which they were thrown that each one
at the moment believed himself shot and the soldiers had overcome all
the real difficulties in getting possession of what might thus be called
the citadel of the inn before those men who had been so valorous a
short time since recovered from the tremendous fright into which they
had been thrown

We need hardly say that the carbines were loaded but with blank
cartridges for there was neither a disposition nor a necessity for
taking the lives of these misguided people

If was the suddenness and the steadiness of the attack that had done all
the mischief to their cause and now ere they recovered from the
surprise of having their position so completely taken by storm they
were handed down stairs one by one from soldier to soldier and into
the custody of the civil authorities

In order to secure the safe keeping of large a body of prisoners the
constables who were in a great minority placed handcuffs upon some of
the most capable of resistance so what with those who were thus
secured and those who were terrified into submission there was not a
man of all the lot who had taken refuge in the attics of the
public-house but was a prisoner

At the sound of fire-arms the women who were outside the inn had of
course raised a most prodigious clamour

They believed directly that every bullet must have done some most
serious mischief to the townspeople and it was only upon one of the
soldiers a non-commissioned officer who was below assuring them of
the innoxious nature of the proceeding which restored anything like
equanimity

Silence he cried what are you howling about Do you fancy that
we've nothing better to do than to shoot a parcel of fellows that are
not worth the bullets that would be lodged in their confounded
carcases

But we heard the gun said a woman

Of course you did it's the powder that makes the noise not the
bullet You'll see them all brought out safe wind and limb

This assurance satisfied the women to a certain extent and such had
been their fear that they should have had to look upon the spectacle of
death or of grievous wounds that they were comparatively quite
satisfied when they saw husbands fathers and brothers only in the
custody of the town officers

And very sheepish some of the fellows looked when they were handed down
and handcuffed and the more especially when they had been routed only
by a few blank cartridges that sixpenny worth of powder had defeated
them

They were marched off to the town gaol guarded by the military who now
probably fancied that their night's work was over and that the most
turbulent and troublesome spirits in the town had been secured

Such however was not the case for no sooner had comparative order
been restored than common observation pointed to a dull red glare in
the southern sky

In a few more minutes there came in stragglers from the open country
shouting Fire fire with all their might




 L

THE MOB'S ARRIVAL AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S THE ATTEMPT TO GAIN
ADMISSION


Illustration

All eyes were directed towards that southern sky which each moment was
becoming more and more illuminated by the lurid appearance bespeaking a
conflagration which if it was not extensive at all events was raging
fiercely

There came too upon the wind which set from that direction strange
sounds resembling shouts of triumph combined occasionally with sharper
cries indicative of alarm

With so much system and so quietly had this attack been made upon the
house of Sir Francis Varney for the consequences of it now exhibited
themselves most unequivocally that no one who had not actually
accompanied the expedition was in the least aware that it had been at
all undertaken or that anything of the kind was on the tapis

Now however it could be no longer kept a secret and as the infuriated
mob who had sought this flagrant means of giving vent to their anger
saw the flames from the blazing house rising high in the heavens they
felt convinced that further secrecy was out of the question

Accordingly in such cries and shouts as but for caution's sake they
would have indulged in from the very first they now gave utterance to
their feelings as regarded the man whose destruction was aimed at

Death to the vampire death to the vampire was the principal shout
and it was uttered in tones which sounded like those of rage and
disappointment

But it is necessary now that we have disposed of the smaller number of
rioters who committed so serious an outrage at the inn that we should
with some degree of method follow the proceedings of the larger number
who went from the town towards Sir Francis Varney's

These persons either had information of a very positive nature or a
very strong suspicion that notwithstanding the mysterious and most
unaccountable disappearance of the vampire in the old ruin he would now
be found as usual at his own residence

Perhaps one of his own servants may have thus played the traitor to him
but however it was there certainly was an air of confidence about some
of the leaders of the tumultuous assemblage that induced a general
belief that this time at least the vampire would not escape popular
vengeance for being what he was

We have before noticed that these people went out of the town at
different points and did not assemble into one mass until they were at
a sufficient distance off to be free from all fear of observation

Then some of the less observant and cautious of them began to indulge in
shouts of rage and defiance but those who placed themselves foremost
succeeded in procuring a halt and one said 

Good friends all if we make any noise it can only have one effect
and that is to warn Sir Francis Varney and enable him to escape If
therefore we cannot go on quietly I propose that we return to our
homes for we shall accomplish nothing

This advice was sufficiently and evidently reasonable to meet with no
dissension a death-like stillness ensued only broken by some two or
three voices saying in subdued tones 

That's right that's right Nobody speak

Come on then said he who had given such judicious counsel and the
dark mass of men moved towards Sir Francis Varney's house as quietly as
it was possible for such an assemblage to proceed

Indeed saving the sound of the footsteps nothing could be heard of
them at all and that regular tramp tramp would have puzzled any one
listening to it from any distance to know in which direction it was
proceeding

In this way they went on until Sir Francis Varney's house was reached
and then a whispered word to halt was given and all eyes were bent upon
the building

From but one window out of the numerous ones with which the front of the
mansion was studded did there shine the least light and from that there
came rather an uncommonly bright reflection probably arising from a
reading lamp placed close to the window

A general impression they knew not why exactly seemed to pervade
everybody that in the room from whence streamed that bright light was
Sir Francis Varney

The vampire's room said several The vampire's room That is it

Yes said he who had a kind of moral control over his comrades I
have no doubt but he is there

What's to be done asked several

Make no noise whatever but stand aside so as not to be seen from the
door when it is opened

Yes yes

I will knock for admittance and the moment it is answered I will
place this stick in such a manner within that the door cannot be closed
again Upon my saying Advance you will make a rush forward and we
shall have possession immediately of the house

All this was agreed to The mob slunk close to the walls of the house
and out of immediate observation from the hall door or from any of the
windows and then the leader advanced and knocked loudly for admission

The silence was now of the most complete character that could be
imagined Those who came there so bent upon vengeance were thoroughly
convinced of the necessity of extreme caution to save themselves even
yet from being completely foiled

They had abundant faith from experience of the resources in the way of
escape of Sir Francis Varney and not one among them was there who
considered that there was any chance of capturing him except by
surprise and when once they got hold of him they determined he should
not easily slip through their fingers

The knock for admission produced no effect and after waiting three or
four minutes it was very provoking to find such a wonderful amount of
caution and cunning completely thrown away

Try again whispered one

Well have patience I am going to try again

The man had the ponderous old-fashioned knocker in his hand and was
about to make another appeal to Sir Francis Varney's door when a
strange voice said 

Perhaps you may as well say at once what you want instead of knocking
there to no purpose

He gave a start for the voice seemed to come from the very door itself

Yet it sounded decidedly human and upon a closer inspection it was
seen that a little wicket-gate not larger than a man's face had been
opened from within

This was terribly provoking Here was an extent of caution on the part
of the garrison quite unexpected What was to be done

Well said the man who appeared at the little opening

Oh said he who had knocked I 

Well

I that is to say ahem Is Sir Francis Varney within

Well

I say is Sir Francis Varney within

Well you have said it

Ah but you have not answered it

No

Well is he at home

I decline saying so you had better all of you go back to the town
again for we are well provided with all material to resist any attack
you may be fools enough to make

As he spoke the servant shut the little square door with a bang that
made his questioner jump again Here was a dilemma




 LI

THE ATTACK UPON THE vampire'S HOUSE THE STORY OF THE ATTACK THE
FORCING OF THE DOORS AND THE STRUGGLE


Illustration

A council of war was now called among the belligerents who were
somewhat taken aback by the steady refusal of the servant to admit them
and their apparent determination to resist all endeavours on the part of
the mob to get into and obtain possession of the house It argued that
they were prepared to resist all attempts and it would cost some few
lives to get into the vampire's house This passed through the minds of
many as they retired behind the angle of the wall where the council was
to be held

Here they looked in each others face as if to gather from that the
general tone of the feelings of their companions but here they saw
nothing that intimated the least idea of going back as they came

It's all very well mates to take care of ourselves you know began
one tall brawny fellow but if we bean't to be sucked to death by a
vampire why we must have the life out of him

Ay so we must

Jack Hodge is right we must kill him and there's no sin in it for he
has no right to it he's robbed some poor fellow of his life to prolong
his own

Ay ay that's the way he does bring him out I say then see what we
will do with him

Yes catch him first said one and then we can dispose of him
afterwards I say neighbours don't you think it would be as well to
catch him first

Haven't we come on purpose

Yes but do it

Ain't we trying it

You will presently when we come to get into the house

Well what's to be done said one here we are in a fix I think and
I can't see our way out very clearly

Illustration

I wish we could get in

But how is a question I don't very well see said a large specimen of
humanity

The best thing that can be done will be to go round and look over the
whole house and then we may come upon some part where it is far easier
to get in at than by the front door

But it won't do for us all to go round that way said one a small
party only should go else they will have all their people stationed at
one point and if we can divide them we shall beat them because they
have not enough to defend more than one point at a time now we are
numerous enough to make several attacks

Oh that's the way to bother them all round they'll give in and then
the place is our own

No no said the big countryman I like to make a good rush and drive
all afore us you know what ye have to do then and you do it ye know

If you can

Ay to be sure if we can as you say but can't we that's what I want
to know

To be sure we can

Then we'll do it mate that's my mind we'll do it Come on and let's
have another look at the street-door

The big countryman left the main body and resolutely walked up to the
main avenue and approached the door accompanied by about a dozen or
less of the mob When they came to the door they commenced knocking and
kicking most violently and assailing it with all kinds of things they
could lay their hands upon

They continued at this violent exercise for some time perhaps for five
minutes when the little square hole in the door was again opened and a
voice was heard to say 

You had better cease that kind of annoyance

We want to get in

It will cost you more lives to do so than you can afford to spare We
are well armed and are prepared to resist any effort you can make

Oh it's all very well but an you won't open why we'll make you
that's all about it

This was said as the big countryman and his companions were leaving the
avenue towards the rest of the body

Then take this as an earnest of what is to follow said the man and
he discharged the contents of a blunderbuss through the small opening
and its report sounded to the rest of the mob like the report of a
field-piece

Fortunately for the party retiring the man couldn't take any aim else
it is questionable how many of the party would have got off unwounded
As it was several of them found stray slugs were lodged in various
parts of their persons and accelerated their retreat from the house of
the vampire

What luck inquired one of the mob to the others as they came back
I'm afraid you had all the honour

Ay ay we have and all the lead too replied a man as he placed his
hand upon a sore part of his person which bled in consequence of a
wound

Well what's to be done

Danged if I know said one

Give it up said another

No no have him out I'll never give in while I can use a stick They
are in earnest and so are we Don't let us be frightened because they
have a gun or two they can't have many and besides if they have we
are too many for them Besides we shall all die in our beds

Hurrah down with the vampire

So say I lads I don't want to be sucked to death when I'm a-bed
Better die like a man than such a dog's death as that and you have no
revenge then

No no he has the better of us then We'll have him out we'll burn
him that's the way we'll do it

Ay so we will only let us get in

At that moment a chosen party returned who had been round the house to
make a reconnaissance

Well well inquired the mob what can be done now where can we get
in

In several places

All right come along then the place is our own

Stop a minute they are armed at all points and we must make an attack
on all points else we may fail A party must go round to the
front-door and attempt to beat it in there are plenty of poles and
things that could be used for such a purpose

There is besides a garden-door that opens into the house a kind of
parlour a kitchen-door a window in the flower-garden and an entrance
into a store-room this place appears strong and is therefore
unguarded

The very point to make an attack

Not quite

Why not

Because it can easily be defended and rendered useless to us We must
make an attack upon all places but that and while they are being at
those points we can then enter at that place and then you will find
them desert the other places when they see us inside

Hurrah down with the vampire said the mob as they listened to this
advice and appreciated the plan

Down with the vampire

Now then lads divide and make the attack never mind their guns
they have but very few and if you rush in upon them you will soon have
the guns yourselves

Hurrah hurrah shouted the mob

The mob now moved away in different bodies each strong enough to carry
the house They seized upon a variety of poles and stones and then made
for the various doors and windows that were pointed out by those who had
made the discovery Each one of those who had formed the party of
observation formed a leader to the others and at once proceeded to the
post assigned him

The attack was so sudden and so simultaneous that the servants were
unprepared and though they ran to the doors and fired away still they
did but little good for the doors were soon forced open by the enraged
rioters who proceeded in a much more systematic operation using long
heavy pieces of timber which were carried on the shoulders of several
men and driven with the force of battering-rams which in fact they
were against the door

Bang went the battering-ram crash went the door and the whole party
rushed headlong in carried forward by their own momentum and fell
prostrate engine and all into the passage

Now then we have them exclaimed the servants who began to belabour
the whole party with blows with every weapon they could secure

Loudly did the fallen men shout for assistance and but for their
fellows who came rushing in behind they would have had but a sorry time
of it

Hurrah shouted the mob the house is our own

Not yet shouted the servants

We'll try said the mob and they rushed forward to drive the servants
back but they met with a stout resistance and as some of them had
choppers and swords there were a few wounds given and presently bang
went the blunderbuss

Two or three of the mob reeled and fell

This produced a momentary panic and the servants then had the whole of
the victory to themselves and were about to charge and clear the
passage of their enemies when a shout behind attracted their attention

That shout was caused by an entrance being gained in another quarter
whence the servants were flying and all was disorder

Hurrah hurrah shouted the mob

The servants retreated to the stairs and here united they made a
stand and resolved to resist the whole force of the rioters and they
succeeded in doing so too for some minutes Blows were given and taken
of a desperate character

Somehow there were no deadly blows received by the servants they were
being forced and beaten but they lost no life this may be accounted
for by the fact that the mob used no more deadly weapons than sticks

The servants of Sir Francis Varney on the contrary were mostly armed
with deadly weapons which however they did not use unnecessarily
They stood upon the hall steps the grand staircase with long poles or
sticks about the size of quarter-staves and with these they belaboured
those below most unmercifully

Certainly the mob were by no means cowards for the struggle to close
with their enemies was as great as ever and as firm as could well be
Indeed they rushed on with a desperation truly characteristic of John
Bull and defied the heaviest blows for as fast as one was stricken
down another occupied his place and they insensibly pressed their close
and compact front upon the servants who were becoming fatigued and
harassed

Fire again exclaimed a voice from among the servants

The mob made no retrogade movement but still continued to press
onwards and in another moment a loud report rang through the house and
a smoke hung over the heads of the mob

A long groan or two escaped some of the men who had been wounded and a
still louder from those who had not been wounded and a cry arose of 

Down with the vampire pull down destroy and burn the whole
place down with them all

A rush succeeded and a few more discharges took place when a shout
above attracted the attention of both parties engaged in this fierce
struggle They paused by mutual consent to look and see what was the
cause of that shout




 LII

THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE MOB AND SIR FRANCIS VARNEY THE MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE THE WINE CELLARS


Illustration

The shout that had so discomposed the parties who were thus engaged in a
terrific struggle came from a party above

Hurrah hurrah they shouted a number of times in a wild strain of
delight Hurrah hurrah hurrah

The fact was a party of the mob had clambered up a verandah and
entered some of the rooms upstairs whence they emerged just above the
landing near the spot where the servants were resisting in a mass the
efforts of the mob

Hurrah shouted the mob below

Hurrah shouted the mob above

There was a momentary pause and the servants divided themselves into
two bodies and one turned to face those above and the other those who
were below

A simultaneous shout was given by both parties of the mob and a sudden
rush was made by both bodies and the servants of Sir Francis Varney
were broken in an instant They were instantly separated and knocked
about a good bit but they were left to shift for themselves the mob
had a more important object in view

Down with the vampire they shouted

Down with the vampire shouted they and they rushed helter skelter
through the rooms until they came to one where the door was partially
open and they could see some person very leisurely seated

Here he is they cried

Who who

The vampire

Down with him kill him burn him

Hurrah down with the vampire

These sounds were shouted out by a score of voices and they rushed
headlong into the room

But here their violence and headlong precipitancy were suddenly
restrained by the imposing and quiet appearance of the individual who
was there seated

The mob entered the room and there was a sight that if it did not
astonish them at least it caused them to pause before the individual
who was seated there

The room was well filled with furniture and there was a curtain drawn
across the room and about the middle of it there was a table behind
which sat Sir Francis Varney himself looking all smiles and courtesy

Well dang my smock-frock said one who'd ha thought of this He
don't seem to care much about it

Well I'm d  d said another he seems pretty easy at all events
What is he going to do

Gentlemen said Sir Francis Varney rising with the blandest smiles
pray gentlemen permit me to inquire the cause of this condescension
on your part The visit is kind

The mob looked at Sir Francis and then at each other and then at Sir
Francis again but nobody spoke They were awed by this gentlemanly and
collected behaviour

If you honour me with this visit from pure affection and neighbourly
good-will I thank you

Down with the vampire said one who was concealed behind the rest
and not so much overawed as he had not seen Sir Francis

Sir Francis Varney rose to his full height a light gleamed across his
features they were strongly defined then His long front teeth too
showed most strongly when he smiled as he did now and said in a bland
voice 

Gentlemen I am at your service Permit me to say you are welcome to
all I can do for you I fear the interview will be somewhat inconvenient
and unpleasant to you As for myself I am entirely at your service

As Sir Francis spoke he bowed and folded his hands together and
stepped forwards but instead of coming onwards to them he walked
behind the curtain and was immediately hid from their view

Down with the vampire shouted one

Down with the vampire rang through the apartment and the mob now
not awed by the coolness and courtesy of Sir Francis rushed forward
and overturning the table tore down the curtain to the floor but to
their amazement there was no Sir Francis Varney present

Where is he

Where is the vampire

Where has he gone

These were cries that escaped every one's lips and yet no one could
give an answer to them

There Sir Francis Varney was not They were completely thunderstricken
They could not find out where he had gone to There was no possible
means of escape that they could perceive There was not an odd corner
or even anything that could by any possibility give even a suspicion
that even a temporary concealment could take place

They looked over every inch of flooring and of wainscoting not the
remotest trace could be discovered

Where is he

I don't know said one I can't see where he could have gone There
ain't a hole as big as a keyhole

My eye said one I shouldn't be at all surprised if he were to blow
up the whole house

You don't say go

I never heard as how vampires could do so much as that They ain't the
sort of people said another

But if they can do one thing they can do another

That's very true

And what's more I never heard as how a vampire could make himself into
nothing before yet he has done so

He may be in this room now

He may

My eyes what precious long teeth he had

Yes and had he fixed one on em in to your arm he would have drawn
every drop of blood out of your body you may depend upon that said an
old man

He was very tall

Yes too tall to be any good

I shouldn't like him to have laid hold of me though tall as he is
and then he would have lifted me up high enough to break my neck when
he let me fall

The mob routed about the room tore everything out of its place and as
the object of their search seemed to be far enough beyond their reach
their courage rose in proportion and they shouted and screamed with a
proportionate increase of noise and bustle and at length they ran about
mad with rage and vexation doing all the mischief that was in their
power to inflict

Then they became mischievous and tore the furniture from its place and
broke it in pieces and then amused themselves with breaking it up
throwing pieces at the pier-glasses in which they made dreadful holes
and when that was gone they broke up the frames

Every hole and corner of the house was searched but there was no Sir
Francis Varney to be found

The cellars the cellars shouted a voice

The cellars the cellars re-echoed nearly every pair of lips in the
whole place in another moment there was crushing and crowding to get
down into the cellars

Hurray said one as he knocked off the neck of the bottle that first
came to hand

Here's luck to vampire-hunting Success to our chase

So say I neighbour but is that your manners to drink before your
betters

So saying the speaker knocked the other's elbow while he was in the
act of lifting the wine to his mouth and thus he upset it over his face
and eyes

D n it cried the man how it makes my eyes smart Dang thee if I
could see I'd ring thy neck

Success to vampire-hunting said one

May we be lucky yet said another

I wouldn't be luckier than this said another as he too emptied a
bottle We couldn't desire better entertainment where the reckoning is
all paid

Excellent

Very good

Capital wine this

I say Huggins

Well said Huggins

What are you drinking

Wine

What wine

Danged if I know was the reply It's wine I suppose for I know it
ain't beer nor spirits so it must be wine

Are you sure it ain't bottled men's blood

Eh

Bottled blood man Who knows what a vampire drinks It may be his
wine He may feast upon that before he goes to bed of a night drink
anybody's health and make himself cheerful on bottled blood

Oh danged I'm so sick I wish I hadn't taken the stuff It may be as
you say neighbour and then we be cannibals

Or vampires

There's a pretty thing to think of

By this time some were drunk some were partially so and the remainder
were crowding into the cellars to get their share of the wine

The servants had now slunk away they were no longer noticed by the
rioters who having nobody to oppose them no longer thought of
anything save the searching after the vampire and the destruction of
the property Several hours had been spent in this manner and yet they
could not find the object of their search

There was not a room or cupboard or a cellar that was capable of
containing a cat that they did not search besides a part of the
rioters keeping a very strict watch on the outside of the house and all
about the grounds to prevent the possibility of the escape of the
vampire

There was a general cessation of active hostilities at that moment a
reaction after the violent excitement and exertion they had made to get
in Then the escape of their victim and the mysterious manner in which
he got away was also a cause of the reaction and the rioters looked in
each others countenances inquiringly

Above all the discovery of the wine-cellar tended to withdraw them from
violent measures but this could not last long there must be an end to
such a scene for there never was a large body of men assembled for an
evil purpose who ever were for any length of time peaceable

To prevent the more alarming effects of drunkenness some few of the
rioters after having taken some small portion of the wine became from
the peculiar flavour it possessed imbued with the idea that it was
really blood and forthwith commenced an instant attack upon the wine
and liquors and they were soon mingling in one stream throughout the
cellars

This destruction was loudly declaimed against by a large portion of the
rioters who were drinking but before they could make any efforts to
save the liquor the work of destruction had not only been begun but
was ended and the consequence was the cellars were very soon evacuated
by the mob




 LIII

THE DESTRUCTION OF SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S HOUSE BY FIRE THE ARRIVAL OF
THE MILITARY AND A SECOND MOB


Illustration

Thus many moments had not elapsed ere the feelings of the rioters became
directed into a different channel from that in which it had so lately
flowed When urged about the house and grounds for the vampire they
became impatient and angry at not finding him Many believed that he was
yet about the house while many were of opinion that he had flown away
by some mysterious means only possessed by vampires and such like
people

Fire the house and burn him out said one

Fire the house

Burn the den now arose in shouts from all present and then the mob
were again animated by the love of mischief that seemed to be the
strongest feelings that animated them

Burn him out burn him out were the only words that could be heard
from any of the mob The words ran through the house like wildfire
nobody thought of anything else and all were seen running about in
confusion

There was no want of good will on the part of the mob to the
undertaking far from it and they proceeded in the work con amore
They worked together with right good will and the result was soon seen
by the heaps of combustible materials that were collected in a short
time from all parts of the house

All the old dry wood furniture that could be found was piled up in a
heap and to these were added a number of faggots and also some
shavings that were found in the cellar

All right exclaimed one man in exultation

Yes replied a second all right all right Set light to it and he
will be smoked out if not burned

Let us be sure that all are out of the house suggested one of the
bystanders

Ay ay shouted several give them all a chance Search through the
house and give them a warning

Very well give me the light and then when I come back I will set
light to the fire at once and then I shall know all is empty and so
will you too

This was at once agreed to by all with acclamations and the light
being handed to the man he ascended the stairs crying out in a loud
voice 

Come out come out the house is on fire

Fire fire fire shouted the mob as a chorus every now and then at
intervals

In about ten minutes more there came a cry of all right the house is
empty from up the stairs and the man descended in haste to the hall

Make haste lads and fire away for I see the red coats are leaving
the town

Hurra hurra shouted the infuriated mob Fire fire fire the house
Burn out the vampire Burn down the house burn him out and see if he
can stand fire

Amidst all this tumult there came a sudden blaze upon all around for
the pile had been fired

Hurra shouted the mob hurra and they danced like maniacs round
the fire looking in fact like so many wild Indians dancing round
their roasting victims or some demons at an infernal feast

The torch had been put to twenty different places and the flames united
into one and suddenly shot up with a velocity and roared with a sound
that caused many who were present to make a precipitate retreat from the
hall

This soon became a necessary measure of self-preservation and it
required no urging to induce them to quit a place that was burning
rapidly and even furiously

Get the poles and firewood get faggots shouted some of the mob and
lo it was done almost by magic They brought the faggots and wood piled
up for winter use and laid them near all the doors and especially the
main entrance Nay every gate or door belonging to the outhouses was
brought forward and placed upon the fire which now began to reach the
upper stories

Hurra fire Hurra fire

And a loud shout of triumph came from the mob as they viewed the
progress of the flames as they came roaring and tearing through the
house doors and the windows

Each new victory of the element was a signal to the mob for a cheer and
a hearty cheer too came from them

Where is the vampire now exclaimed one

Ha where is he said another

If he be there said the man pointing to the flames I reckon he's
got a warm berth of it and at the same time very little water to boil
in his kettle

Ha ha what a funny old man is Bob Mason he's always poking fun he'd
joke if his wife were dying

There is many a true word spoken in jest suggested another and to
my mind Bob Mason wouldn't be very much grieved if his wife were to
die

Die said Bob she and I have lived and quarrelled daily a matter of
five-and-thirty years and if that ain't enough to make a man sick of
being married and of his wife hand me that's all I say I am tired

This was said with much apparent sincerity and several laughed at the
old man's heartiness

It's all very well said the old man it's all very well to laugh
about matters you don't understand but I know it isn't a joke not a
bit on it I tells you what it is neighbour I never made but one grand
mistake in all my life

And what was that

To tie myself to a woman

Why you'd get married to-morrow if your wife were to die to-day said
one

If I did I hope I may marry a vampire I should have something then to
think about I should know what's o'clock But as for my old woman
lord lord I wish Sir Francis Varney had had her for life I'll warrant
when the next natural term of his existence came round again he
wouldn't be in no hurry to renew it if he did I should say that
vampires had the happy lot of managing women which I haven't got

No nor anybody else

A loud shout now attracted their attention and upon looking in the
quarter whence it came they descried a large body of people coming
towards them from one end of the mob could be seen a long string of red
coats

The red coats shouted one

The military shouted another

It was plain the military who had been placed in the town to quell
disturbances had been made acquainted with the proceedings at Sir
Francis Varney's house and were now marching to relieve the place and
to save the property

They were as we have stated accompanied by a vast concourse of people
who came out to see what they were going to see and seeing the flames
at Sir Francis Varney's house they determined to come all the way and
be present

The military seeing the disturbance in the distance and the flames
issuing from the windows made the best of their way towards the scene
of tumult with what speed they could make

Here they come said one

Yes just in time to see what is done

Yes they can go back and say we have burned the vampire's house
down hurra

Hurra shouted the mob in prolonged accents and it reached the ears
of the military

The officer urged the men onwards and they responded to his words by
exerting themselves to step out a little faster

Oh they should have been here before this it's no use now they are
too late

Yes they are too late

I wonder if the vampire can breathe through the smoke and live in
fire said one

I should think he must be able to do so if he can stand shooting as
we know he can you can't kill a vampire but yet he must be consumed
if the fire actually touches him but not unless he can bear almost
anything

So he can

Hurra shouted the mob as a tall flame shot through the top windows
of the house

The fire had got the ascendant now and no hopes could be entertained
however extravagant of saving the smallest article that had been left
in the mansion

Hurra shouted the mob with the military who came up with them

Hurra shouted the others in reply

Quick march said the officer and then in a loud commanding tone
he shouted Clear the way there clear the way

Ay there's room enough for you said old Mason what are you making
so much noise about

There was a general laugh at the officer who took no notice of the
words but ordered his men up before the burning pile which was now an
immense mass of flame

The mob who had accompanied the military now mingled with the mob that
had set the house of Sir Francis Varney on fire ere the military had
come up with them

Halt cried out the officer and the men obedient to the word of
command halted and drew up in a double line before the house

There were then some words of command issued and some more given to
some of the subalterns and a party of men under the command of a
sergeant was sent off from the main body to make a circuit of the
house and grounds

The officer gazed for some moments upon the burning pile without
speaking and then turning to the next in command he said in low
tones as he looked upon the mob 

We have come too late

Yes much

The house is now nearly gutted

It is

And those who came crowding along with us are inextricably mingled with
the others who have been the cause of all this mischief there's no
distinguishing them one from another

And if you did you could not say who had done it and who had not you
could prove nothing

Exactly

I shall not attempt to take prisoners unless any act is perpetrated
beyond what has been done

It is a singular affair

Very

This Sir Francis Varney is represented to be a courteous gentlemanly
man said the officer

No doubt about it but he's beset by a parcel of people who do not mind
cutting a throat if they can get an opportunity of doing so

And I expect they will

Yes when there is a popular excitement against any man he had better
leave this part at once and altogether It is dangerous to tamper with
popular prejudices no man who has any value for his life ought to do
so It is a sheer act of suicide




 LIV

THE BURNING OF VARNEY'S HOUSE A NIGHT SCENE POPULAR SUPERSTITION


Illustration

The officer ceased to speak and then the party whom he had sent round
the house and grounds returned and gained the main body orderly enough
and the sergeant went forward to make his report to his superior
officer

After the usual salutation he waited for the inquiry to be put to him
as to what he had seen

Well Scott what have you done

I went round the premises sir according to your instructions but saw
no one either in the vicinity of the house or in the grounds around
it

No strangers eh

No sir none

You saw nothing at all likely to lead to any knowledge as to who it was
that has caused this catastrophe

No sir

Have you learnt anything among the people who are the perpetrators of
this fire

No sir

Well then that will do unless there is anything else that you can
think of

Nothing further sir unless it is that I heard some of them say that
Sir Francis Varney has perished in the flames

Good heavens

So I heard sir

That must be impossible and yet why should it be so Go back Scott
and bring me some person who can give me some information upon this
point

The sergeant departed toward the people who looked at him without any
distrust for he came single-handed though they thought he came with
the intention of learning what they knew of each other and so stroll
about with the intention of getting up accusations against them But
this was not the case the officer didn't like the work well enough
he'd rather have been elsewhere

Illustration

At length the sergeant came to one man whom he accosted and said to
him 

Do you know anything of yonder fire

Yes I do know it is a fire

Yes and so do I

My friend said the sergeant when a soldier asks a question he does
not expect an uncivil answer

But a soldier may ask a question that may have an uncivil end to it

He may but it is easy to say so

I do say so then now

Then I'll not trouble you any more

The sergeant moved on a pace or two more and then turning to the mob
he said 

Is there any one among you who can tell me anything concerning the fate
of Sir Francis Varney

Burnt

Did you see him burnt

No but I saw him

In the flames

No before the house was on fire

In the house

Yes and he has not been seen to leave it since and we conclude he
must have been burned

Will you come and say as much to my commanding officer It is all I
want

Shall I be detained

No

Then I will go said the man and he hobbled out of the crowd towards
the sergeant I will go and see the officer and tell him what I know
and that is very little and can prejudice no one

Hurrah said the crowd when they heard this latter assertion for at
first they began to be in some alarm lest there should be something
wrong about this and some of them get identified as being active in the
fray

The sergeant led the man back to the spot where the officer stood a
little way in advance of his men

Well Scott he said what have we here

A man who has volunteered a statement sir

Oh Well my man can you say anything concerning all this disturbance
that we have here

No sir

Then what did you come here for

I understood the sergeant to want some one who could speak of Sir
Francis Varney

Well

I saw him

Where

In the house

Exactly but have you not seen him out of it

Not since nor any one else I believe

Where was he

Upstairs where he suddenly disappeared and nobody can tell where he
may have gone to But he has not been seen out of the house since and
they say he could not have gone bodily out if they had not seen him

He must have been burnt said the officer musingly he could not
escape one would imagine without being seen by some one out of such a
mob

Oh dear no for I am told they placed a watch at every hole window
or door however high and they saw nothing of him not even fly out

Fly out I'm speaking of a man

And I of a vampire said the man carelessly

A vampire Pooh pooh

Oh no Sir Francis Varney is a vampire There can be no sort of doubt
about it You have only to look at him and you will soon be satisfied
of that See his great sharp teeth in front and ask yourself what they
are for and you will soon find the answer They are to make holes with
in the bodies of his victims through which he can suck their blood

The officer looked at the man in astonishment for a few moments as if
he doubted his own ears and then he said 

Are you serious

I am ready to swear to it

Well I have heard a great deal about popular superstition and thought
I had seen something of it but this is decidedly the worst case that
ever I saw or heard of You had better go home my man than by your
presence countenance such a gross absurdity

For all that said the man Sir Francis Varney is a vampire a
blood-sucker a human blood-sucker

Get away with you said the officer and do not repeat such folly
before any one

The man almost jumped when he heard the tone in which this was spoken
for the officer was both angry and contemptuous when he heard the words
of the man

These people he added turning to the sergeant are ignorant in the
extreme One would think we had got into the country of vampires
instead of a civilised community

The day was going down now the last rays of the setting sun glimmered
upwards and still shone upon the tree-tops The darkness of night was
still fast closing around them The mob stood a motley mass of human
beings wedged together dark and sombre gazing upon the mischief that
had been done the work of their hands The military stood at ease
before the burning pile and by their order and regularity presented a
contrast to the mob as strongly by their bright gleaming arms as by
their dress and order

The flames now enveloped the whole mansion There was not a window or a
door from which the fiery element did not burst forth in clouds and
forked flames came rushing forth with a velocity truly wonderful

The red glare of the flames fell upon all objects around for some
distance the more especially so as the sun had sunk and a bank of
clouds rose from beneath the horizon and excluded all his rays there
was no twilight and there was as yet no moon

The country side was enveloped in darkness and the burning house could
be seen for miles around and formed a rallying-point to all men's eyes

The engines that were within reach came tearing across the country and
came to the fire but they were of no avail There was no supply of
water save from the ornamental ponds These they could only get at by
means that were tedious and unsatisfactory considering the emergency of
the case

The house was a lone one and it was being entirely consumed before they
arrived and therefore there was not the remotest chance of saving the
least article Had they ever such a supply of water nothing could have
been effected by it

Thus the men stood idly by passing their remarks upon the fire and the
mob

Those who stood around and within the influence of the red glare of the
flames looked like so many demons in the infernal regions watching the
progress of lighting the fire which we are told by good Christians is
the doom of the unfortunate in spirit and the woefully unlucky in
circumstances

It was a strange sight that and there were many persons who would
without doubt have rather been snug by their own fire-side than they
would have remained there but it happened that no one felt inclined to
express his inclination to his neighbour and consequently no one said
anything on the subject

None would venture to go alone across the fields where the spirit of
the vampire might for all they knew to the contrary be waiting to
pounce upon them and worry them

No no no man would have quitted that mob to go back alone to the
village they would sooner have stood there all night through That was
an alternative that none of the number would very willingly accept

The hours passed away and the house that had been that morning a noble
and well-furnished mansion was now a smouldering heap of ruins The
flames had become somewhat subdued and there was now more smoke than
flames

The fire had exhausted itself There was now no more material that could
serve it for fuel and the flames began to become gradually enough
subdued

Suddenly there was a rush and then a bright flame shot upward for an
instant so bright and so strong that it threw a flash of light over
the country for miles but it was only momentary and it subsided

The roof which had been built strong enough to resist almost anything
after being burning for a considerable time suddenly gave way and came
in with a tremendous crash and then all was for a moment darkness

After this the fire might be said to be subdued it having burned itself
out and the flames that could now be seen were but the result of so
much charred wood that would probably smoulder away for a day or two
if left to itself to do so A dense mass of smoke arose from the ruins
and blackened the atmosphere around and told the spectators the work
was done




 LV

THE RETURN OF THE MOB AND MILITARY TO THE TOWN THE MADNESS OF THE
MOB THE GROCER'S REVENGE


Illustration

On the termination of the conflagration or rather the fall of the
roof with the loss of grandeur in the spectacle men's minds began to
be free from the excitement that chained them to the spot watching the
progress of that element which has been truly described as a very good
servant but a very bad master and of the truth of this every one must
be well satisfied

There was now remaining little more than the livid glare of the hot and
burning embers and this did not extend far for the walls were too
strongly built to fall in from their own weight they were strong and
stout and intercepted the little light the ashes would have given out

The mob now began to feel fatigued and chilly It had been standing and
walking about many hours and the approach of exhaustion could not be
put off much longer especially as there was no longer any great
excitement to carry it off

The officer seeing that nothing was to be done collected his men
together and they were soon seen in motion He had been ordered to stop
any tumult that he might have seen and to save any property But there
was nothing to do now all the property that could have been saved was
now destroyed and the mob were beginning to disperse and creep towards
their own houses

The order was then given for the men to take close order and keep
together and the word to march was given which the men obeyed with
alacrity for they had no good-will in stopping there the whole of the
night

The return to the village of both the mob and the military was not
without its vicissitudes accidents of all kinds were rife amongst them
the military however taking the open paths soon diminished the
distance and that too with little or no accidents save such as might
have been expected from the state of the fields after they had been so
much trodden down of late

Not so the townspeople or the peasantry for by way of keeping up their
spirits and amusing themselves on their way home they commenced
larking as they called it which often meant the execution of practical
jokes and these sometimes were of a serious nature

The night was dark at that hour especially so when there was a number
of persons traversing about so that little or nothing could be seen

The mistakes and blunders that were made were numerous In one place
there were a number of people penetrating a path that led only to a
hedge and deep ditch indeed it was a brook very deep and muddy

Here they came to a stop and endeavoured to ascertain its width but the
little reflected light they had was deceptive and it did not appear so
broad as it was

Oh I can jump it exclaimed one

And so can I said another I have done so before and why should I
not do so now

This was unanswerable and as there were many present at least a dozen
were eager to jump

If thee can do it I know I can said a brawny countryman so I'll do
it at once

The sooner the better shouted some one behind or you'll have no
room for a run here's a lot of em coming up push over as quickly as
you can

Thus urged the jumpers at once made a rush to the edge of the ditch
and many jumped and many more from the prevailing darkness did not
see exactly where the ditch was and taking one or two steps too many
found themselves up above the waist in muddy water

Nor were those who jumped much better off for nearly all jumped short
or fell backwards into the stream and were dragged out in a terrible
state

Oh lord oh lord exclaimed one poor fellow dripping wet and
shivering with cold I shall die oh the rheumatiz there'll be a
pretty winter for me I'm half dead

Hold your noise said another and help me to get the mud out of my
eye I can't see

Never mind added a third considering how you jump I don't think
you want to see

This comes a hunting vampires

Oh it's all a judgment who knows but he may be in the air it is
nothing to laugh at as I shouldn't be surprised if he were only think
how precious pleasant

However pleasant it may be to you remarked one it's profitable to a
good many

How so

Why see the numbers of things that will be spoiled coats torn hats
crushed heads broken and shoes burst Oh it's an ill-wind that blows
nobody any good

So it is but you may benefit anybody you like so you don't do it at
my expence

In one part of a field where there were some stiles and gates a big
countryman caught a fat shopkeeper with the arms of the stile a terrible
poke in the stomach while the breath was knocked out of the poor man's
stomach and he was gasping with agony the fellow set to laughing and
said to his companions who were of the same class 

I say Jim look at the grocer he hasn't got any wind to spare I'd
run him for a wager see how he gapes like a fish out of water

The poor shopkeeper felt indeed like a fish out of water and as he
afterwards declared he felt just as if he had had a red hot clock weight
thrust into the midst of his stomach and there left to cool

However the grocer would be revenged upon his tormentor who had now
lost sight of him but the fat man after a time recovering his wind
and the pain in his stomach becoming less intense he gathered himself
up

My name ain't Jones he muttered if I don't be one to his one for
that I'll do something that shall make him remember what it is to
insult a respectable tradesman I'll never forgive such an insult It is
dark and that's why it is he has dared to do this

Filled with dire thoughts and a spirit of revenge he looked from side
to side to see with what he could effect his object but could espy
nothing

It's shameful he muttered what would I give for a little retort
I'd plaster his ugly countenance

As he spoke he placed his hands on some pales to rest himself when he
found that they stuck to them the pales had that day been newly
pitched

A bright idea now struck him

If I could only get a handful of this stuff he thought I should be
able to serve him out for serving me out I will cost what it may I'm
resolved upon that I'll not have my wind knocked out and my inside set
on fire for nothing No no I'll be revenged on him

With this view he felt over the pales and found that he could scrape
off a little only but not with his hands indeed it only plastered
them he therefore marched about for something to scrape it off with

Ah I have a knife a large pocket knife that will do that is the
sort of thing I want

He immediately commenced feeling for it but had scarcely got his hand
into his pocket when he found there would be a great difficulty in
either pushing it in further or withdrawing it altogether for the pitch
made it difficult to do either and his pocket stuck to his hands like a
glove

D n it said the grocer who would have thought of that here's a
pretty go curse that fellow he is the cause of all this I'll be
revenged upon him if it's a year hence

The enraged grocer drew his hand out but was unable to effect his
object in withdrawing the knife also but he saw something shining he
stooped to pick it up exclaiming as he did so in a gratified tone of
voice

Ah here's something that will do better

As he made a grasp at it he found he had inserted his hand into
something soft

God bless me what now

He pulled his hand hastily away and found that it stuck slightly and
then he saw what it was

Ay ay the very thing Surely it must have been placed here on purpose
by the people

The fact was he had placed his hand into a pot of pitch that had been
left by the people who had been at work at pitching the pales but had
been attracted by the fire at Sir Francis Varney's and to see which
they had left their work and the pitch was left on a smouldering peat
fire so that when Mr Jones the grocer accidentally put his hand into
it he found it just warm

When he made this discovery he dabbed his hand again into the pitch-pot
exclaiming 

In for a penny in for a pound

And he endeavoured to secure as large a handful of the slippery and
sticky stuff as he could and this done he set off to come up with the
big countryman who had done him so much indignity and made his stomach
uncomfortable

He soon came up with him for the man had stopped rather behind and was
larking as it is called with some men to whom he was a companion

He had slipped down a bank and was partially sitting down on the soft
mud In his bustle the little grocer came down with a slide close to
the big countryman

Ah ah my little grocer said the countryman holding out his hand to
catch him and drawing him towards himself You will come and sit down
by the side of your old friend

As he spoke he endeavoured to pull Mr Jones down too but that
individual only replied by fetching the countryman a swinging smack
across the face with the handful of pitch

There take that and now we are quits we shall be old friends after
this eh Are you satisfied You'll remember me I'll warrant

As the grocer spoke he rubbed his hands over the face of the fallen
man and then rushed from the spot with all the haste he could make

The countryman sat a moment or two confounded cursing and swearing
and spluttering vowing vengeance believing that it was mud only that
had been plastered over his face but when he put his hands up and
found out what it was he roared and bellowed like a town-bull

He cried out to his companions that his eyes were pitched but they only
laughed at him thinking he was having some foolish lark with them

It was next day before he got home for he wandered about all night and
it took him a week to wash the pitch off by means of grease and ever
afterwards he recollected the pitching of his face nor did he ever
forget the grocer

Thus it was the whole party returned a long while after dark across the
fields with all the various accidents that were likely to befal such an
assemblage of people

The vampire hunting cost many of them dear for clothes were injured on
all sides hats lost and shoes missing in a manner that put some of the
rioters to much inconvenience Soon afterwards the military retired to
their quarters and the townspeople at length became tranquil and
nothing more was heard or done that night




 LVI

THE DEPARTURE OF THE BANNERWORTHS FROM THE HALL THE NEW ABODE JACK
PRINGLE PILOT


Illustration

During that very evening on which the house of Sir Francis Varney was
fired by the mob another scene and one of different character was
enacted at Bannerworth Hall where the owners of that ancient place were
departing from it

It was towards the latter part of the day that Flora Bannerworth Mrs
Bannerworth and Henry Bannerworth were preparing themselves to depart
from the house of their ancestors The intended proprietor was as we
have already been made acquainted with the old admiral who had taken
the place somewhat mysteriously considering the way in which he usually
did business

The admiral was walking up and down the lawn before the house and
looking up at the windows every now and then and turning to Jack
Pringle he said 

Jack you dog

Ay ay sir

Mind you convoy these women into the right port do you hear and no
mistaking the bearings do you hear

Ay ay sir

These crafts want care and you are pilot commander and all so mind
and keep your weather eye open

Ay ay sir I knows the craft well enough and I knows the roads too
there'll be no end of foundering against the breakers to find where they
lie

No no Jack you needn't do that but mind your bearings Jack mind
your bearings

Never fear I know em well enough my eyes ain't laid up in ordinary
yet

Eh What do you mean by that you dog eh

Nothing only I can see without helps to read or glasses either so I
know one place from another

There was now some one moving within and the admiral followed by Jack
Pringle entered the Hall Henry Bannerworth was there They were all
ready to go when the coach came for them which the admiral had ordered
for them

Jack you lubber where are you

Ay ay sir here am I

Go and station yourself up in some place where you can keep a good
look-out for the coach and come and report when you see it

Ay ay sir said Jack and away he went from the room and stationed
himself up in one of the trees that commanded a good view of the main
road for some distance

Admiral Bell said Henry here we are trusting implicitly to you
and in doing so I am sure I am doing right

You will see that said the admiral All's fair and honest as yet
and what is to come will speak for itself

I hope you won't suffer from any of these nocturnal visits said
Henry

I don't much care about them but old Admiral Bell don't strike his
colours to an enemy however ugly he may look No no it must be a
better craft than his own that'll take him and one who won't run away
but that will grapple yard-arm and yard-arm you know

Why admiral you must have seen many dangers in your time and be used
to all kinds of disturbances and conflicts You have had a life of
experience

Yes and experience has come pretty thick sometimes I can tell you
when it comes in the shape of Frenchmen's broadsides

I dare say then it must be rather awkward

Death by the law said the admiral to stop one of them with your
head I assure you I dare not make the attempt myself though I have
often seen it done

I dare say but here are Flora and my mother

As he spoke Flora and her mother entered the apartment

Well admiral we are all ready and though I may feel somewhat sorry
at leaving the old Hall yet it arises from attachment to the place and
not any disinclination to be beyond the reach of these dreadful alarms

And I too shall be by no means sorry said Flora I am sure it is
some gratification to know we leave a friend here rather than some
others who would have had the place if they could have got it by any
means

Ah that's true enough Miss Flora said the admiral but we'll run
the enemy down yet depend upon it But once away you will be free from
these terrors and now as you have promised do not let yourselves be
seen any where at all

You have our promises admiral and they shall be religiously kept I
can assure you

Boat ahoy ahoy shouted Jack

What boat said the admiral surprised and then he muttered
Confound you for a lubber Didn't I tell you to mind your bearings you
dog-fish you

Ay ay sir and so I did

You did

Yes here they are Squint over the larboard bulk-heads as they call
walls and then atween the two trees on the starboard side of the
course then straight ahead for a few hundred fathoms when you come to
a funnel as is smoking like the crater of Mount Vesuvius and then in a
line with that on the top of the hill comes our boat

Well said the admiral that'll do Now go open the gates and keep a
bright look out and if you see anybody near your watch why douse their
glim

Ay ay sir said Jack and he disappeared

Rather a lucid description said Henry as he thought of Jack's report
to the admiral

Oh it's a seaman's report I know what he means it's quicker and
plainer than the land lingo to my ears and Jack can't talk any other
you see

By this time the coach came into the yard and the whole party descended
into the court-yard where they came to take leave of the old place

Farewell admiral

Good bye said the admiral I hope the place you are going to will be
such as please you I hope it will

I am sure we shall endeavour to be pleased with it and I am pretty
sure we shall

Good bye

Farewell Admiral Bell said Henry

You remember your promises

I do Good bye Mr Chillingworth

Good bye said Mr Chillingworth who came up to bid them farewell a
pleasant journey and may you all be the happier for it

You do not come with us

No I have some business of importance to attend to else I should have
the greatest pleasure in doing so But good bye we shall not be long
apart I dare say

I hope not said Henry

The door of the carriage was shut by the admiral who looked round
saying 

Jack Jack Pringle where are you you dog

Here am I said Jack

Where have you been to

Only been for pigtail said Jack I forgot it and couldn't set sail
without it

You dog you didn't I tell you to mind your bearings

So I will said Jack fore and aft fore and aft admiral

You had better said the admiral who however relaxed into a broad
grin which he concealed from Jack Pringle

Jack mounted the coach-box and away it went just as it was getting
dark The old admiral had locked up all the rooms in the presence of
Henry Bannerworth and when the coach had gone out of sight Mr
Chillingworth came back to the Hall where he joined the admiral

Well he said they are gone Admiral Bell and we are alone we have
a clear stage and no favour

The two things of all others I most desire Now they will be strangers
where they are going to and that will be something gained I will
endeavour to do some thing if I get yard-arm and yard-arm with these
pirates I'll make em feel the weight of true metal I'll board
'em d  e I'll do everything

Everything that can be done

Ay ay

                                   

The coach in which the family of the Bannerworths were carried away
continued its course without any let or hindrance and they met no one
on their road during the whole drive The fact was nearly everybody was
at the conflagration at Sir Francis Varney's house

Flora knew not which way they were going and after a time all trace
of the road was lost Darkness set in and they all sat in silence in
the coach

At length after some time had been spent thus Flora Bannerworth turned
to Jack Pringle and said 

Are we near or have we much further to go

Not very much ma'am said Jack All's right however ship in the
direct course and no breakers ahead no lookout necessary however
there's a land-lubber aloft to keep a look out

As this was not very intelligible and Jack seemed to have his own
reasons for silence they asked him no further questions but in about
three-quarters of an hour during which time the coach had been driving
through the trees they came to a standstill by a sudden pull of the
check-string from Jack who said 

Hilloa take in sails and drop anchor

Is this the place

Yes here we are said Jack we're in port now at all events and
he began to sing 

    The trials and the dangers of the voyage is past

when the coach door opened and they all got out and looked about them
where they were

Up the garden if you please ma'am as quick as you can the night air
is very cold

Flora and her mother and brother took the hint which was meant by Jack
to mean that they were not to be seen outside They at once entered a
pretty garden and then they came to a very neat and picturesque
cottage They had no time to look up at it as the door was immediately
opened by an elderly female who was intended to wait upon them

Soon after Jack Pringle and the coachman entered the passage with the
small amount of luggage which they had brought with them This was
deposited in the passage and then Jack went out again and after a few
minutes there was the sound of wheels which intimated that the coach
had driven off

Jack however returned in a few minutes afterwards having secured the
wicket-gate at the end of the garden and then entered the house
shutting the door carefully after him

Flora and her mother looked over the apartments in which they were shown
with some surprise It was in everything such as they could wish
indeed though it could not be termed handsomely or extravagantly
furnished or that the things were new yet there was all that
convenience and comfort could require and some little of the luxuries

Well said Flora this is very thoughtful of the admiral The place
will really be charming and the garden too delightful

Mustn't be made use of just now said Jack if you please ma'am
them's the orders at present

Very well said Flora smiling I suppose Mr Pringle we must obey
them

Jack Pringle if you please said Jack My commands only temporary I
ain't got a commission




 LVII

THE LONELY WATCH AND THE ADVENTURE IN THE DESERTED HOUSE


Illustration

It is now quite night and so peculiar and solemn a stillness reigns in
and about Bannerworth Hall and its surrounding grounds that one might
have supposed it a place of the dead deserted completely after sunset
by all who would still hold kindred with the living There was not a
breath of air stirring and this circumstance added greatly to the
impression of profound repose which the whole scene exhibited

The wind during the day had been rather of a squally character but
towards nightfall as is often usual after a day of such a character it
had completely lulled and the serenity of the scene was unbroken even
by the faintest sigh from a wandering zephyr

The moon rose late at that period and as is always the case at that
interval between sunset and the rising of that luminary which makes the
night so beautiful the darkness was of the most profound character

It was one of those nights to produce melancholy reflections a night on
which a man would be apt to review his past life and to look into the
hidden recesses of his soul to see if conscience could make a coward of
him in the loneliness and stillness that breathed around

It was one of those nights in which wanderers in the solitude of nature
feel that the eye of Heaven is upon them and on which there seems to be
a more visible connection between the world and its great Creator than
upon ordinary occasions

The solemn and melancholy appear places once instinct with life when
deserted by those familiar forms and faces that have long inhabited
them There is no desert no uninhabited isle in the far ocean no wild
barren pathless tract of unmitigated sterility which could for one
moment compare in point of loneliness and desolation to a deserted city

Strip London mighty and majestic as it is of the busy swarm of
humanity that throng its streets its suburbs its temples its public
edifices and its private dwellings and how awful would be the walk of
one solitary man throughout its noiseless thoroughfares

Illustration

If madness seized not upon him ere he had been long the sole survivor of
a race it would need be cast in no common mould

And to descend from great things to smaller from the huge leviathan
city to one mansion far removed from the noise and bustle of
conventional life we may imagine the sort of desolation that reigned
through Bannerworth Hall when for the first time after nearly a
hundred and fifty years of occupation it was deserted by the
representatives of that family so many members of which had lived and
died beneath its roof The house and everything within without and
around it seemed actually to sympathize with its own desolation and
desertion

It seemed as if twenty years of continued occupation could not have
produced such an effect upon the ancient edifice as had those few hours
of neglect and desertion

And yet it was not as if it had been stripped of those time-worn and
ancient relics of ornament and furnishing that so long had appertained
to it No nothing but the absence of those forms which had been
accustomed quietly to move from room to room and to be met here upon a
staircase there upon a corridor and even in some of the ancient
panelled apartments which give it an air of dreary repose and
listlessness

The shutters too were all closed and that circumstance contributed
largely to the production of that gloomy effect which otherwise could
not have ensued

In fact what could be done without attracting very special observation
was done to prove to any casual observer that the house was untenanted

But such was not really the case In that very room where the much
dreaded Varney the vampire had made one of his dreaded appearances to
Flora Bannerworth and her mother sat two men

It was from that apartment that Flora had discharged the pistol which
had been left to her by her brother and the shot from which it was
believed by the whole family had most certainly taken effect upon the
person of the vampire

It was a room peculiarly accessible from the gardens for it had long
French windows opening to the very ground and but a stone step
intervened between the flooring of the apartment and a broad gravel walk
which wound round that entire portion of the house

It was in this room then that two men sat in silence and nearly in
darkness

Before them and on a table were several articles of refreshment as
well of defence and offence according as their intentions might be

There were a bottle and three glasses and lying near the elbow of one
of the men was a large pair of pistols such as might have adorned the
belt of some desperate character who wished to instil an opinion of his
prowess into his foes by the magnitude of his weapons

Close at hand by the same party lay some more modern fire arms as
well as a long dirk with a silver mounted handle

The light they had consisted of a large lantern so constructed with a
slide that it could be completely obscured at a moment's notice but
now as it was placed the rays that were allowed to come from it were
directed as much from the window of the apartment as possible and fell
upon the faces of the two men revealing them to be Admiral Bell and Dr
Chillingworth

It might have been the effect of the particular light in which he sat
but the doctor looked extremely pale and did not appear at all at his
ease

The admiral on the contrary appeared in as placable a state of mind as
possible and had his arms folded across his breast and his head shrunk
down between his shoulders as if he had made up his mind to something
that was to last a long time and therefore he was making the best of
it

I do hope said Mr Chillingworth after a long pause that our
efforts will be crowned with success you know my dear sir that I have
always been of your opinion that there was a great deal more in this
matter than met the eye

To be sure said the admiral and as to our efforts being crowned
with success why I'll give you a toast doctor may the morning's
reflection provide for the evening's amusement'

Ha ha said Chillingworth faintly I'd rather not drink any more
and you seem admiral to have transposed the toast in some way I
believe it runs may the evening's amusement bear the morning's
reflection'

Transpose the devil said the admiral what do I care how it runs I
gave you my toast and as to that you mention it's another one
altogether and a sneaking shore-going one too but why don't you
drink

Why my dear sir medically speaking I am strongly of opinion that
when the human stomach is made to contain a large quantity of alcohol
it produces bad effects upon the system Now I've certainly taken one
glass of this infernally strong Hollands and it is now lying in my
stomach like the red-hot heater of a tea-urn

Is it put it out with another then

Ay I'm afraid that would not answer but do you really think admiral
that we shall effect anything by waiting here and keeping watch and
ward not under the most comfortable circumstances this first night of
the Hall being empty

Well I don't know that we shall said the admiral but when you
really want to steal a march upon the enemy there is nothing like
beginning betimes We are both of opinion that Varney's great object
throughout has been by some means or another to get possession of the
house

Yes true true

We know that he has been unceasing in his endeavours to get the
Bannerworth family out of it that he has offered them their own price
to become its tenant and that the whole gist of his quiet and placid
interview with Flora in the garden was to supply her with a new set of
reasons for urging her mother and brother to leave Bannerworth Hall
because the old ones were certainly not found sufficient

True true most true said Mr Chillingworth emphatically You
know sir that from the first time you broached that view of the
subject to me how entirely I coincided with you

Of course you did for you are a honest fellow and a right-thinking
fellow though you are a doctor and I don't know that I like doctors
much better than I like lawyers they're only humbugs in a different
sort of way But I wish to be liberal there is such a thing as an
honest lawyer and d  e you're an honest doctor

Of course I'm much obliged admiral for your good opinion I only wish
it had struck me to bring something of a solid nature in the shape of
food to sustain the waste of the animal economy during the hours we
shall have to wait here

Don't trouble yourself about that said the admiral Do you think I'm
a donkey and would set out on a cruise without victualling my ship I
should think not Jack Pringle will be here soon and he has my orders
to bring in something to eat

Well said the doctor that's very provident of you admiral and I
feel personally obliged but tell me how do you intend to conduct the
watch

What do you mean

Why I mean if we sit here with the window fastened so as to prevent
our light from being seen and the door closed how are we by any
possibility to know if the house is attacked or not

Hark'ee my friend said the admiral I've left a weak point for the
enemy

A what admiral

A weak point I've taken good care to secure everything but one of the
windows on the ground floor and that I've left open or so nearly open
that it will look like the most natural place in the world to get in at
Now just inside that window I've placed a lot of the family crockery
I'll warrant if anybody so much as puts his foot in you'll hear the
smash and d  e there it is

There was a loud crash at this moment followed by a succession of
similar sounds but of a lesser degree and both the admiral and Mr
Chillingworth sprung to their feet

Come on cried the former here'll be a precious row take the
lantern

Mr Chillingworth did so but he did not seem possessed of a great deal
of presence of mind for before they got out of the room he twice
accidentally put on the dark slide and produced a total darkness

D n said the admiral don't make it wink and wink in that way hold
it up and run after me as hard as you can

I'm coming I'm coming said Mr Chillingworth

It was one of the windows of a long room containing five fronting the
garden which the admiral had left purposely unguarded and it was not
far from the apartment in which they had been sitting so that
probably not half a minute's time elapsed between the moment of the
first alarm and their reaching the spot from whence it was presumed to
arise

The admiral had armed himself with one of the huge pistols and he
dashed forward with all the vehemence of his character towards the
window where he knew he had placed the family crockery and where he
fully expected to meet the reward of his exertion by discovering some
one lying amid its fragments

In this however he was disappointed for although there was evidently
a great smash amongst the plates and dishes the window remained closed
and there was no indication whatever of the presence of any one

Well that's odd said the admiral I balanced them up amazingly
careful and two of em edgeways d -e a fly would have knocked them
down

Mew said a great cat emerging from under a chair

Curse you there you are said the admiral Put out the light put
out the light here we're illuminating the whole house for nothing

With a click went the darkening slide over the lantern and all was
obscurity

At that instant a shrill clear whistle came from the garden




 LVIII

THE ARRIVAL OF JACK PRINGLE MIDNIGHT AND THE vampire THE MYSTERIOUS
HAT


Illustration

Bless me what is that said Mr Chillingworth what a very singular
sound

Hold your noise said the admiral did you never hear that before

No how should I

Lor bless the ignorance of some people that's a boatswain's call

Oh it is said Mr Chillingworth is he going to call again

D  e I tell ye it's a boatswain's call

Well then d  e if it comes to that said Mr Chillingworth what
does he call here for

The admiral disdained an answer but demanding the lantern he opened
it so that there was a sufficient glimmering of light to guide him and
then walked from the room towards the front door of the Hall

He asked no questions before he opened it because no doubt the signal
was preconcerted and Jack Pringle for it was he indeed who had
arrived at once walked in and the admiral barred the door with the
same precision with which it was before secured

Well Jack he said did you see anybody

Ay ay sir said Jack

Why ye don't mean that where

Where I bought the grub a woman 

D  e you're a fool Jack

You're another

Hilloa ye scoundrel what d'ye mean by talking to me in that way is
this your respect for your superiors

Ship's been paid off long ago said Jack and I ain't got no
superiors I ain't a marine or a Frenchman

Why you're drunk

I know it put that in your eye

There's a scoundrel Why you know-nothing-lubber didn't I tell you to
be careful and that everything depended upon secrecy and caution and
didn't I tell you above all this to avoid drink

To be sure you did

And yet you come here like a rum cask

Yes now you've had your say what then

You'd better leave him alone said Mr Chillingworth it's no use
arguing with a drunken man

Harkye admiral said Jack steadying himself as well as he could
I've put up with you a precious long while but I won't no longer
you're so drunk now that you keeping bobbing up and down like the
mizen gaff in a storm that's my opinion tol de rol

Let him alone let him alone urged Mr Chillingworth

The villain said the admiral he's enough to ruin everything now
who would have thought that but it's always been the way with him for a
matter of twenty years he never had any judgment in his drink When it
was all smooth sailing and nothing to do and the fellow might have got
an extra drop on board which nobody would have cared for he's as sober
as a judge but whenever there's anything to do that wants a little
cleverness confound him he ships rum enough to float a seventy-four

Are you going to stand anything to drink said Jack my old buffer
Do you recollect where you got your knob scuttled off Beyrout how you
fell on your latter end and tried to recollect your church cateckis you
old brute I's ashamed of you Do you recollect the brown girl you
bought for thirteen bob and a tanner at the blessed Society Islands
and sold her again for a dollar to a nigger seven feet two in his
natural pumps you're a nice article you is to talk of marines and
swabs and shore-going lubbers blow yer Do you recollect the little
Frenchman that told ye he'd pull your blessed nose and I advised you to
soap it do you recollect Sall at Spithead as you got in at a port hole
of the state cabin all but her behind

Death and the devil said the admiral breaking from the grasp of Mr
Chillingworth

Ay said Jack you'll come to em both one of these days old cock
and no mistake

I'll have his life I'll have his life roared the admiral

Nay nay sir said Mr Chillingworth catching the admiral round the
waist My dear sir recollect now if I may venture to advise you
Admiral Bell there's a lot of that fiery hollands you know in the next
room set firm down to that and finish him off I'll warrant him he'll
be quiet enough

What's that you say cried Jack hollands who's got any next to
rum and Elizabeth Baker if I has an affection it's hollands

Jack said the admiral

Ay ay sir said Jack instinctively

Come this way

Jack staggered after him and they all reached the room where the
admiral and Mr Chillingworth had been sitting before the alarm

There said the admiral putting the light upon the table and
pointing to the bottle what do you think of that

I never thinks under such circumstances said Jack Here's to the
wooden walls of old England

He seized the bottle and putting its neck into his mouth for a few
moments nothing was heard but a gurgling sound of the liquor passing
down his throat his head went further and further back until at last
over he went chair and bottle and all and lay in a helpless state of
intoxication on the floor

So far so good said the admiral He's out of the way at all
events

I'll just loosen his neckcloth said Mr Chillingworth and then
we'll go and sit somewhere else and I should recommend that if
anywhere we take up our station in that chamber once Flora's where
the mysterious panelled portrait hangs that bears so strong a
resemblance to Varney the vampire

Hush said the admiral What's that

They listened for a moment intently and then distinctly upon the
gravel path outside the window they heard a footstep as if some person
were walking along not altogether heedlessly but yet without any very
great amount of caution or attention to the noise he might make

Hist said the doctor Not a word They come

What do you say they for said the admiral

Because something seems to whisper me that Mr Marchdale knows more of
Varney the vampire than ever he has chosen to reveal Put out the
light

Yes yes that'll do The moon has risen see how it streams through
the chinks of the shutters

No no it's not in that direction or our light would have betrayed
us Do you not see the beams come from that half glass-door leading to
the greenhouse

Yes and there's the footstep again or another

Tramp tramp came a footfall again upon the gravel path and as before
died away upon their listening ears

What do you say now said Mr Chillingworth are there not two

If they were a dozen said the admiral although we have lost one of
our force I would tackle them Let's creep on through the rooms in the
direction the footsteps went

My life on it said Mr Chillingworth as they left the apartment if
this be Varney he makes for that apartment where Flora slept and which
he knows how to get admission to I've studied the house well admiral
and to get to that window any one from here outside must take a
considerable round Come on we shall be beforehand

A good idea a good idea Be it so

Just allowing themselves sufficient light to guide them on the way from
the lantern they hurried on with as much precipitation as the
intricacies of the passage would allow nor halted till they had reached
the chamber were hung the portrait which bore so striking and remarkable
a likeness to Varney the vampire

They left the lamp outside the door so that not even a straggling beam
from it could betray that there were persons on the watch and then as
quietly as foot could fall they took up their station among the
hangings of the antique bedstead which has been before alluded to in
this work as a remarkable piece of furniture appertaining to that
apartment

Do you think said the admiral we've distanced them

Certainly we have It's unlucky that the blind of the window is down

Is it By Heaven there's a d  d strange-looking shadow creeping over
it

Mr Chillingworth looked almost with suspended breath Even he could not
altogether get rid of a tremulous feeling as he saw that the shadow of
a human form apparently of very large dimensions was on the outside
with the arms spread out as if feeling for some means of opening the
window

It would have been easy now to have fired one of the pistols direct upon
the figure but somehow or another both the admiral and Mr
Chillingworth shrank from that course and they felt much rather
inclined to capture whoever might make his appearance only using their
pistols as a last resource than gratuitously and at once to resort to
violence

Who should you say that was whispered the admiral

Varney the vampire

D  e he's ill-looking and big enough for anything there's a noise

There was a strange cracking sound at the window as if a pane of glass
was being very stealthily and quietly broken and then the blind was
agitated slightly confusing much the shadow that was cast upon it as
if the hand of some person was introduced for the purpose of effecting a
complete entrance into the apartment

He's coming in whispered the admiral

Hush for Heaven's sake said Mr Chillingworth you will alarm him
and we shall lose the fruit of all the labour we have already bestowed
upon the matter but did you not say something admiral about lying
under the window and catching him by the leg

Why yes I did

Go and do it then for as sure as you are a living man his leg will
be in in a minute

Here goes said the admiral I never suggest anything which I'm
unwilling to do myself

Whoever it was that now was making such strenuous exertions to get into
the apartment seemed to find some difficulty as regarded the fastenings
of the window and as this difficulty increased the patience of the
party as well as his caution deserted him and the casement was rattled
with violence

With a far greater amount of caution than any one from a knowledge of
his character would have given him credit for the admiral crept forward
and laid himself exactly under the window

The depth of wood-work from the floor to the lowest part of the
window-frame did not exceed above two feet so that any one could
conveniently step in from the balcony outride on to the floor of the
apartment which was just what he who was attempting to effect an
entrance was desirous of doing

It was quite clear that be he who he might mortal or vampire he had
some acquaintance with the fastening of the window for now he succeeded
in moving it and the sash was thrown open

The blind was still an obstacle but a vigorous pull from the intruder
brought that down on the prostrate admiral and then Mr Chillingworth
saw by the moonlight a tall gaunt figure standing in the balcony as
if just hesitating for a moment whether to get head first or feet first
into the apartment

Had he chosen the former alternative he would need indeed to have been
endowed with more than mortal powers of defence and offence to escape
capture but his lucky star was in the ascendancy and he put his foot
in first

He turned his side to the apartment and as he did so the blight
moonlight fell upon his face enabling Mr Chillingworth to see without
the shadow of a doubt that it was indeed Varney the vampire who was
thus stealthily making his entrance into Bannerworth Hall according to
the calculation which had been made by the admiral upon that subject
The doctor scarcely knew whether to be pleased or not at this discovery
it was almost a terrifying one sceptical as he was upon the subject of
vampires and he waited breathless for the issue of the singular and
perilous adventure

No doubt Admiral Bell deeply congratulated himself upon the success
which was about to crown his stratagem for the capture of the intruder
be he who he might and he writhed with impatience for the foot to come
sufficiently near him to enable him to grasp it

His patience was not severely tried for in another moment it rested
upon his chest

Boarders a hoy shouted the admiral and at once he laid hold of the
trespasser Yard-arm to yard-arm I think I've got you now Here's a
prize doctor he shall go away without his leg if he goes away now Eh
what the light d  e he has Doctor the light the light Why
what's this Hilloa there

Dr Chillingworth sprang into the passage and procured the light in
another moment he was at the side of the admiral and the lantern slide
being thrown back he saw at once the dilemma into which his friend had
fallen

There he lay upon his back grasping with the vehemence of an embrace
that had in it much of the ludicrous a long boot from which the
intruder had cleverly slipped his leg leaving it as a poor trophy in
the hands of his enemies

Why you've only pulled his boot off said the doctor and now he's
gone for good for he knows what we're about and has slipped through
your fingers

Admiral Bell sat up and looked at the boot with a rueful countenance

Done again he said

Yes you are done said the doctor why didn't you lay hold of the
leg while you were about it instead of the boot Admiral are these
your tactics

Don't be a fool said the admiral put out the light and give me the
pistols or blaze away yourself into the garden a chance shot may do
something It's no use running after him a stern chase is a long chase
but fire away

As if some parties below had heard him give the word two loud reports
from the garden immediately ensued and a crash of glass testified to
the fact that some deadly missile had entered the room

Murder said the doctor and he fell flat upon his back I don't like
this at all it's all in your line admiral but not in mine

All's right my lad said the admiral now for it

He saw lying in the moonlight the pistols which he and the doctor had
brought into the room and in another moment he to use his own words
returned the broadside of the enemy

D n it he said this puts me in mind of old times Blaze away you
thieves while I load broadside to broadside It's your turn now I
scorn to take an advantage What the devil's that

Something very large and very heavy came bang against the window
sending it all into the room and nearly smothering the admiral with the
fragments Another shot was then fired and in came something else
which hit the wall on the opposite side of the room rebounding from
thence on to the doctor who gave a yell of despair

After that all was still the enemy seemed to be satisfied that they had
silenced the garrison And it took the admiral a great deal of kicking
and plunging to rescue himself from some superincumbent mass that was
upon him which seemed to him to be a considerable sized tree

Call this fair fighting he shouted getting a man's legs and arms
tangled up like a piece of Indian matting in the branches of a tree
Doctor I say hilloa where are you

I don't know said the doctor but there's somebody getting into the
balcony now we shall be murdered in cold blood

Where's the pistols

Fired off of course you did it yourself

Bang came something else into the room which from the sound it made
closely resembled a brick and after that somebody jumped clean into the
centre of the floor and then after rolling and writhing about in a
most singular manner slowly got up and with various preliminary
hiccups said 

Come on you lubbers many of you as like I'm the tar for all
weathers

Why d  e said the admiral it's Jack Pringle

Yes it is said Jack who was not sufficiently sober to recognise the
admiral's voice I sees as how you've heard of me Come on all of
you

Why Jack you scoundrel roared the admiral how came you here
Don't you know me I'm your admiral you horse-marine

Eh said Jack Ay ay sir how came you here

How came you you villain

Boarded the enemy

The enemy who you boarded was us and hang me if I don't think you
haven't been pouring broadsides into us while the enemy were scudding
before the wind in another direction

Lor said Jack

Explain you scoundrel directly explain

Well that's only reasonable said Jack and giving a heavier lurch
than usual he sat down with a great bounce upon the floor You see
it's just this here when I was a coming of course I heard just as I
was a going that ere as made me come all in consequence of somebody a
going or for to come you see admiral

Doctor cried the admiral in a great rage just help me out of this
entanglement of branches and I'll rid the world from an encumbrance by
smashing that fellow

Smash yourself said Jack You know you're drunk

My dear admiral said Mr Chillingworth laying hold of one of his
legs and pulling it very hard which brought his face into a lot of
brambles we're making a mess of this business

Murder shouted the admiral you are indeed Is that what you call
pulling me out of it You've stuck me fast

I'll manage it said Jack I've seed him in many a scrape and I've
seed him out You pull me doctor and I'll pull him Yo hoy

Jack laid hold of the admiral by the scuff of the neck and the doctor
laid hold of Jack round the waist the consequence of which was that he
was dragged out from the branches of the tree which seemed to have been
thrown into the room and down fell both Jack and the doctor

At this instant there was a strange hissing sound heard below the
window then there was a sudden loud report as if a hand-grenade had
gone off A spectral sort of light gleamed into the room and a tall
gaunt-looking figure rose slowly up in the balcony

Beware of the dead said a voice Let the living contend with the
living the dead with the dead Beware

The figure disappeared as did also the strange spectral-looking light
A death-like silence ensued and the cold moonbeams streamed in upon the
floor of the apartment as if nothing had occurred to disturb the
wrapped repose and serenity of the scene




 LIX

THE WARNING THE NEW PLAN OF OPERATION THE INSULTING MESSAGE FROM
VARNEY


Illustration

So much of the night had been consumed in these operations that by the
time they were over and the three personages who lay upon the floor of
what might be called the haunted chamber of Bannerworth Hall even had
they now been disposed to seek repose would have had a short time to do
so before the daylight would have streamed in upon them and roused them
to the bustle of waking existence

It may be well believed what a vast amount of surprise came over the
three persons in that chamber at the last little circumstance that had
occurred in connection with the night's proceedings

There was nothing which had preceded that that did not resemble a
genuine attack upon the premises but about that last mysterious
appearance with its curious light there was quite enough to bother the
admiral and Jack Pringle to a considerable effect whatever might be the
effect upon Mr Chillingworth whose profession better enabled him to
comprehend chemically what would produce effects that no doubt
astonished them amazingly

What with his intoxication and the violent exercise he had taken Jack
was again thoroughly prostrate while the admiral could not have looked
more astonished had the evil one himself appeared in propria persona
and given him notice to quit the premises

He was however the first to speak and the words he spoke were
addressed to Jack to whom he said 

Jack you lubber what do you think of all that

Jack however was too far gone even to say Ay ay sir and Mr
Chillingworth slowly getting himself up to his feet approached the
admiral

It's hard to say so much Admiral Bell he said but it strikes me
that whatever object this Sir Francis Varney or Varney the vampire
has in coming into Bannerworth Hall it is at all events of sufficient
importance to induce him to go any length and not to let even a life to
stand in the way of its accomplishment

Well it seems so said the admiral for I'll be hanged if I can make
head or tail of the fellow

If we value our personal safety we shall hesitate to continue a
perilous adventure which I think can end only in defeat if not in
death

But we don't value our personal safety said the admiral We've got
into the adventure and I don't see why we shouldn't carry it out It
may be growing a little serious but what of that For the sake of that
young girl Flora Bannerworth as well as for the sake of my nephew
Charles Holland I will see the end of this affair let it be what it
may but mind you Mr Chillingworth if one man chooses to go upon a
desperate service that's no reason why he should ask another to do so

I understand you said Mr Chillingworth but having commenced the
adventure with you I am not the man to desert you in it We have
committed a great mistake

A mistake how

Why we ought to have watched outside the house instead of within it
There can be no doubt that if we had lain in wait in the garden we
should have been in a better position to have accomplished our object

Well I don't know doctor but it seems to me that if Jack Pringle
hadn't made such a fool of himself we should have managed very well
and I don't know now how he came to behave in the manner he did

Nor I said Mr Chillingworth But at all events so far as the
result goes it is quite clear that any further watching in this house
for the appearance of Sir Francis Varney will now be in vain He has
nothing to do now but to keep quiet until we are tired out a fact
concerning which he can easily obtain information and then he
immediately without trouble walks into the premises to his own
satisfaction

But what the deuce can he want upon the premises

That question admiral induces me to think that we have made another
mistake We ought not to have attempted to surprise Sir Francis Varney
in coming into Bannerworth Hall but to catch him as he came out

Illustration

Well there's something in that said the admiral This is a pretty
night's business to be sure However it can't be helped it's done
and there's an end on't And now as the morning is near at hand I
certainly must confess I should like to get some breakfast although I
don't like that we should all leave the house together

Why said Mr Chillingworth as we have now no secret to keep with
regard to our being here because the principal person we wished to keep
it from is aware of it I think we cannot do better than send at once
for Henry Bannerworth tell him of the non-success of the effort we have
made in his behalf and admit him at once into our consultation of what
is next to be done

Agreed agreed I think that without troubling him we might have
captured this Varney but that's over now and as soon as Jack Pringle
chooses to wake up again I'll send him to the Bannerworths with a
message

Ay ay sir said Jack suddenly all's right

Why you vagabond said the admiral I do believe you've been
shamming

Shamming what

Being drunk to be sure

Lor couldn't do it said Jack I'll just tell you how it was I
wakened up and found myself shut in somewhere and as I couldn't get
out of the door I thought I'd try the window and there I did get out
Well perhaps I wasn't quite the thing but I sees two people in the
garden a looking up at this ere room and to be sure I thought it was
you and the doctor Well it warn't no business of mine to interfere so
I seed one of you climb up the balcony as I thought and then after
which come down head over heels with such a run that I thought you
must have broken your neck Well after that you fired a couple of shots
in and then after that I made sure it was you admiral

And what made you make sure of that

Why because you scuttled away like an empty tar-barrel in full tide

Confound you you scoundrel

Well then confound you if it comes to that I thought I was doing
you good sarvice and that the enemy was here when all the while it
turned out as you was and the enemy wasn't and the enemy was outside
and you wasn't

But who threw such a confounded lot of things into the room

Why I did of course I had but one pistol and when I fired that
off I was forced to make up a broadside with what I could

Was there ever such a stupid said the admiral doctor doctor you
talked of us making two mistakes but you forgot a third and worse one
still and that was the bringing such a lubberly son of a sea-cook into
the place as this fellow

You're another said Jack and you knows it

Well well said Mr Chillingworth it's no use continuing it
admiral Jack in his way did I dare say what he considered for the
best

I wish he'd do then what he considers for the worst next time

Perhaps I may said Jack and then you will be served out above a
bit What ud become of you I wonder if it wasn't for me I'm as good
as a mother to you you knows that you old babby

Come come admiral said Mr Chillingworth come down to the
garden-gate it is now just upon daybreak and the probability is that
we shall not be long there before we see some of the country people who
will get us anything we require in the shape of refreshment and as for
Jack he seems quite sufficiently recovered now to go to the
Bannerworths'

Oh I can go said Jack as for that the only thing as puts me out
of the way is the want of something to drink My constitution won't
stand what they call temperance living or nothing with the chill off

Go at once said the admiral and tell Mr Henry Bannerworth that we
are here but do not tell him before his sister or his mother If you
meet anybody on the road send them here with a cargo of victuals It
strikes me that a good comfortable breakfast wouldn't be at all amiss
doctor

How rapidly the day dawns remarked Mr Chillingworth as he walked
into the balcony from whence Varney the vampire had attempted to make
good his entrance to the Hall

Just as he spoke and before Jack Pringle could get half way over to the
garden gate there came a tremendous ring at the bell which was
suspended over it

A view of that gate could not be commanded from the window of the
haunted apartment so that they could not see who it was that demanded
admission

As Jack Pringle was going down at any rate they saw no necessity for
personal interference and he proved that there was not by presently
returning with a note which he said had been thrown over the gate by a
lad who then scampered off with all the speed he could make

The note exteriorly was well got up and had all the appearance of
great care having been bestowed upon its folding and sealing

It was duly addressed to Admiral Bell Bannerworth Hall and the word
immediate was written at one corner

The admiral after looking at it for some time with very great wonder
came at last to the conclusion that probably to open it would be the
shortest way of arriving at a knowledge of who had sent it and he
accordingly did so

The note was as follows 

    My dear sir Feeling assured that you cannot be surrounded
    with those means and appliances for comfort in the Hall in its
    now deserted condition which you have a right to expect and so
    eminently deserve I flatter myself that I shall receive an
    answer in the affirmative when I request the favour of your
    company to breakfast as well as that of your learned friend
    Mr Chillingworth

    In consequence of a little accident which occurred last evening
    to my own residence I am ad interim until the county build
    it up for me again staying at a house called Walmesley Lodge
    where I shall expect you with all the impatience of one
    soliciting an honour and hoping that it will be conferred upon
    him

    I trust that any little difference of opinion on other subjects
    will not interfere to prevent the harmony of our morning's meal
    together

    Believe me to be my dear sir with the greatest possible
    consideration your very obedient humble servant

    FRANCIS VARNEY

The admiral gasped again and looked at Mr Chillingworth and then at
the note and then at Mr Chillingworth again as if he was perfectly
bewildered

That's about the coolest piece of business said Mr Chillingworth
that ever I heard of

Hang me said the admiral if I sha'n't like the fellow at last It
is cool and I like it because it is cool Where's my hat where's my
stick

What are you going to do

Accept his invitation to be sure and breakfast with him and my
learned friend as he calls you I hope you'll come likewise I'll take
the fellow at his word By fair means or by foul I'll know what he
wants here and why he persecutes this family for whom I have an
attachment and what hand he has in the disappearance of my nephew
Charles Holland for as sure as there's a Heaven above us he's at the
bottom of that affair Where is this Walmesley Lodge

Just in the neighbourhood but 

Come on then come on

But really admiral you don't mean to say you'll breakfast
with with 

A vampire Yes I would and will and mean to do so Here Jack you
needn't go to Mr Bannerworth's yet Come my learned friend let's take
Time by the forelock




 LX

THE INTERRUPTED BREAKFAST AT SIR FRANCIS VARNEY'S


Illustration

Notwithstanding all Mr Chillingworth could say to the contrary the
admiral really meant to breakfast with Sir Francis Varney

The worthy doctor could not for some time believe but that the admiral
must be joking when he talked in such a strain but he was very soon
convinced to the contrary by the latter actually walking out and once
more asking him Mr Chillingworth if he meant to go with him or not

This was conclusive so the doctor said 

Well admiral this appears to me rather a mad sort of freak but as I
have begun the adventure with you I will conclude it with you

That's right said the admiral I'm not deceived in you doctor so
come along Hang these vampires I don't know how to tackle them
myself I think after all Sir Francis Varney is more in your line than
line is in mine

How do you mean

Why couldn't you persuade him he's ill and wants some physic That
would soon settle him you know

Settle him said Mr Chillingworth I beg to say that if I did give
him any physic the dose would be much to his advantage but however
my opinion is that this invitation to breakfast is after all a mere
piece of irony and that when we get to Walmesley Lodge we shall not
see anything of him on the contrary we shall probably find it's a
hoax

I certainly shouldn't like that but still it's worth the trying The
fellow has really behaved himself in such an extraordinary manner that
if I can make terms with him I will and there's one thing you know
doctor that I think we may say we have discovered

And what may that be Is it not to make too sure of a vampire even
when you have him by the leg

No that ain't it though that's a very good thing in its way but it
is just this that Sir Francis Varney whoever he is and whatever he is
is after Bannerworth Hall and not the Bannerworth family If you
recollect Mr Chillingworth in our conversation I have always
insisted upon that fact

You have and it seems to me to be completely verified by the
proceedings of the night There then admiral is the great
mystery what can he want at Bannerworth Hall that makes him take such a
world of trouble and run so many fearful risks in trying to get at it

That is indeed the mystery and if he really means this invitation to
breakfast I shall ask him plumply and tell him at the same time that
possibly his very best way to secure his object will be to be candid
vampire as he is

But really admiral you do not still cling to that foolish
superstition of believing that Sir Francis Varney is in reality a
vampire

I don't know and I can't say if anybody was to give me a description
of a strange sort of fish that I had never seen I wouldn't take upon
myself to say there wasn't such a thing nor would you doctor if you
had really seen the many odd ones that I have encountered at various
times

Well well admiral I'm certainly not belonging to that school of
philosophy which declares the impossible to be what it don't understand
there may be vampires and there may be apparitions for all I know to
the contrary I only doubt these things because I think if they were
true that as a phenomena of nature they would have been by this time
established by repeated instances without the possibility of doubt or
cavil

Well there's something in that but how far have we got to go now

No further than to yon enclosure where you see those park-like looking
gates and that cedar-tree stretching its dark-green foliage so far into
the road that is Walmesley Lodge whither you have been invited

And you my learned friend recollect that you were invited too so
that you are no intruder upon the hospitality of Varney the vampire

I say admiral said Mr Chillingworth when they reached the gates
you know it is not quite the thing to call a man a vampire at his own
breakfast-table so just oblige me by promising not to make any such
remark to Sir Francis

A likely thing said the admiral he knows I know what he is and he
knows I'm a plain man and a blunt speaker however I'll be civil to
him and more than that I can't promise I must wring out of him if I
can what has become of Charles Holland and what the deuce he really
wants himself

Well well come to no collision with him while we're his guests

Not if I can help it

The doctor rang at the gate bell of Walmesley Lodge and was in a few
moments answered by a woman who demanded their business

Is Sir Francis Varney here said the doctor

Oh ah yes she replied you see his house was burnt down for
something or other I'm sure I don't know what by some people I'm sure
I don't know who so as the lodge was to let we have took him in till
he can suit himself

Ah that's it is it said the admiral tell him that Admiral Bell
and Dr Chillingworth are here

Very well said the woman you may walk in

Thank ye you're vastly obliging ma'am Is there anything going on in
the breakfast line

Well yes I am getting him some breakfast but he didn't say as he
expected company

The woman opened the garden gate and they walked up a trimly laid out
garden to the lodge which was a cottage-like structure in external
appearance although within it boasted of all the comforts of a
tolerably extensive house

She left them in a small room leading from the hall and was absent
about five minutes then she returned and merely saying that Sir
Francis Varney presented his compliments and desired them to walk up
stairs she preceded them up a handsome flight which led to the first
floor of the lodge

Up to this moment Mr Chillingworth had expected some excuse for
notwithstanding all he had heard and seen of Sir Francis Varney he
could not believe that any amount of impudence would suffice to enable
him to receive people as his guests with whom he must feel that he was
at such positive war

It was a singular circumstance and perhaps the only thing that
matched the cool impertinence of the invitation was the acceptance of
it under the circumstances by the admiral

Sir Francis Varney might have intended it as a jest but if he did so
in the first instance it was evident he would not allow himself to be
beaten with his own weapons

The room into which they were shown was a longish narrow one a very
wide door gave them admission to it at the end nearest the staircase
and at its other extremity there was a similar door opening into some
other apartments of the house

Sir Francis Varney sat with his back towards this second door and a
table with some chairs and other articles of furniture were so
arranged before him that while they seemed but to be carelessly placed
in the position they occupied they really formed a pretty good barrier
between him and his visitors

The admiral however was too intent upon getting a sight of Varney to
notice any preparation of this sort and he advanced quickly into the
room

And there indeed was the much dreaded troublesome persevering and
singular looking being who had caused such a world of annoyance to the
family of the Bannerworths as well as disturbing the peace of the whole
district which had the misfortune to have him as an inhabitant

If anything he looked thinner taller and paler than usual and there
seemed to be a slight nervousness of manner about him as he slowly
inclined his head towards the admiral which was not quite intelligible

Well said Admiral Bell you invited me to breakfast and my learned
friend here we are

No two human beings said Varney could be more welcome to my
hospitality than yourself and Dr Chillingworth I pray you to be
seated What a pleasant thing it is after the toils and struggles of
this life occasionally to sit down in the sweet companionship of such
dear friends

He made a hideous face as he spoke and the admiral looked as if he were
half inclined to quarrel at that early stage of the proceedings

Dear friends he said well well it's no use squabbling about a
word or two but I tell you what it is Mr Varney or Sir Francis
Varney or whatever your d  d name is 

Hold my dear sir said Varney after breakfast if you please after
breakfast

He rang a hand-bell as he spoke and the woman who had charge of the
house brought in a tray tolerably covered with the materials for a
substantial morning's meal She placed it upon the table and certainly
the various articles that smoked upon it did great credit to her
culinary powers

Deborah said Sir Varney in a mild sort of tone keep on continually
bringing things to eat until this old brutal sea ruffian has satiated
his disgusting appetite

The admiral opened his eyes an enormous width and looking at Sir
Francis Varney he placed his two fists upon the table and drew a long
breath

Did you address those observations to me he said at length you
blood-sucking vagabond

Eh said Sir Francis Varney looking over the admiral's head as if he
saw something interesting on the wall beyond

My dear admiral said Mr Chillingworth come away

I'll see you d  d first said the admiral Now Mr vampire no
shuffling did you address those observations to me

Deborah said Sir Francis Varney in silvery tones you can remove
this tray and bring on the next

Not if I know it said the admiral I came to breakfast and I'll have
it after breakfast I'll pull your nose ay if you were fifty vampires
I'd do it

Dr Chillingworth said Varney without paying the least attention to
what the admiral said you don't eat my dear sir you must be fatigued
with your night's exertions A man of your age you know cannot be
supposed to roll and tumble about like a fool in a pantomime with
impunity Only think what a calamity it would be if you were laid up
Your patients would all get well you know

Sir Francis Varney said Mr Chillingworth we're your guests we
come here at your invitation to partake of a meal You have wantonly
attacked both of us I need not say that by so doing you cast a far
greater slur upon your own taste and judgment than you can upon us

Admirably spoken said Sir Francis Varney giving his hands a clap
together that made the admiral jump again Now old Bell I'll fight
you if you think yourself aggrieved while the doctor sees fair play

Old who shouted the admiral

Bell Bell is not your name Bell a family cognomen I presume on
account of the infernal clack clack without any sense in it that is
the characteristic of your race

You'll fight me said the admiral jumping up

Yes if you challenge me

By Jove I do of course

Then I accept it and the challenged party you know well or ought to
know can make his own terms in the encounter

Make what terms you please I care not what they are Only say you will
fight and that's sufficient

It is well said Sir Francis Varney in a solemn tone

Nay nay interrupted Mr Chillingworth this is boyish folly

Hold your row said the admiral and let's hear what he's got to
say

In this mansion said Sir Francis Varney for a mansion it is
although under the unpretending name of a lodge in this mansion there
is a large apartment which was originally fitted up by a scientific
proprietor of the place for the purpose of microscopic and other
experiments which required a darkness total and complete such a
darkness as seems as if it could be felt palpable thick and obscure
as the darkness of the tomb and I know what that is

The devil you do said this admiral It's damp too ain't it

The room

No the grave

Oh uncommonly after autumnal rains But to resume this room is
large lofty and perfectly empty

Well

I propose that we procure two scythes

Two what

Scythes with their long handles and their convenient holding places

Well I'll be hanged What next do you propose

You may be hanged The next is that with these scythes we be both of
us placed in the darkened room and the door closed and doubly locked
upon us for one hour and that then and there we do our best each to cut
the other in two If you succeed in dismembering me you will have won
the day but I hope from my superior agility here Sir Francis jumped
upon his chair and sat upon the back of it to get the better of you
How do you like the plan I have proposed Does it meet your wishes

Curse your impudence said the admiral placing his elbows upon the
table and resting his chin in astonishment upon his two hands

Nay interrupted Sir Francis you challenged me and besides you'll
have an equal chance you know that If you succeed in striking me
first down I go whereas it I succeed in striking you first down you
go

As he spoke Sir Francis Varney stretched out his foot and closed a
small bracket which held out the flap of the table on which the admiral
was leaning and accordingly down the admiral went tea-tray and all

Mr Chillingworth ran to help him up and when they both recovered
their feet they found they were alone




 LXI

THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUICIDE AT BANNERWORTH
HALL


Illustration

Hilloa where the deuce is he said the admiral Was there ever such a
confounded take-in

Well I really don't know said Mr Chillingworth but it seems to me
that he must have gone out of that door that was behind him I begin do
you know admiral to wish 

What

That we had never come here at all and I think the sooner we get out
of it the better

Yes but I am not going to be hoaxed and humbugged in this way I will
have satisfaction but not with those confounded scythes and things he
talks about in the dark room Give me broad daylight and no favour
yardarm and yardarm broadside and broadside hand-grenades and
marling-spikes

Well but that's what he won't do Now admiral listen to me

Well go on what next

Come away at once

Oh you said that before

Yes but I'm going to say something else Look round you Don't you
think this a large scientific-looking room

What of that

Why what if suppose it was to become as dark as the grave and Varney
was to enter with his scythe that he talks of and begin mowing about
our legs

The devil Come along

The door at which they entered was at this moment opened and the old
woman made her appearance

Please sir she said here's a Mr Mortimer in a loud voice Oh
Sir Francis ain't here Where's he gone gentlemen

To the devil said the admiral Who may Mr Mortimer be

There walked past the woman a stout portly-looking man well dressed
but with a very odd look upon his face in consequence of an obliquity
of vision which prevented the possibility of knowing which way he was
looking

I must see him he said I must see him

Mr Chillingworth started back as if in amazement

Good God he cried you here

Confusion said Mortimer are you Dr   Dr  


The same Hush there is no occasion to betray that is to state my
secret

And mine too said Chillingworth But what brings you here

I cannot and dare not tell you Farewell

He turned abruptly and was leaving the room but he ran against some
one at the entrance and in another moment Henry Bannerworth heated and
almost breathless by evident haste made his appearance

Hilloa bravo cried the admiral the more the merrier Here's a
combined squadron Why how came you here Mr Henry Bannerworth

Bannerworth said Mortimer is that young man's name Bannerworth

Yes said Henry Do you know me sir

No no only I I must be off Does anybody know anything of Sir
Francis Varney

We did know something of him said the admiral a little while ago
but he's taken himself off Don't you do so likewise If you've got
anything to say stop and say it like an Englishman

Stuff stuff said Mortimer impatiently What do you all want here

Why Sir Francis Varney said Henry and I care not if the whole
world heard it is the persecutor of my family

How in what way

He has the reputation of a vampire he has hunted me and mine from
house and home

Indeed

Yes cried Dr Chillingworth and by some means or another he seems
determined to get possession of Bannerworth Hall

Well gentlemen said Mortimer I promise you that I will inquire
into this Mr Chillingworth I did not expect to meet you Perhaps the
least we say to each other is after all the better

Let me ask but one question said Dr Chillingworth imploringly

Ask it

Did he live after 

Hush he did

You always told me to the contrary

Yes I had an object the game is up Farewell and gentlemen as I am
making my exit let me do so with a sentiment Society at large is
divided into two great classes

And what may they be said the admiral

Those who have been hanged and those who have not Adieu

He turned and left the room and Mr Chillingworth sunk into a chair
and said in a low voice 

It's uncommonly true and I've found out an acquaintance among the
former

-D n it you seem all mad said the admiral I can't make out what
you are about How came you here Mr Henry Bannerworth

By mere accident I heard said Henry that you were keeping watch and
ward in the Hall Admiral it was cruel and not well done of you to
attempt such an enterprise without acquainting me with it Did you
suppose for a moment that I who had the greatest interest in this
affair would have shrunk from danger if danger there be or lacked
perseverance if that quality were necessary in carrying out any plan by
which the safety and honour of my family might be preserved

Nay now my young friend said Mr Chillingworth

Nay sir but I take it ill that I should have been kept out of this
affair and it should have been sedulously as it were kept a secret
from me

Let him go on as he likes said the admiral boys will be boys After
all you know doctor it's my affair and not yours Let him say what
he likes where's the odds It's of no consequence

I do not expect Admiral Bell said Henry that it is to you but it
is to me

Psha

Respecting you sir as I do 

Gammon

I must confess that I did expect 

What you didn't get therefore there's an end of that Now I tell you
what Henry Sir Francis Varney is within this house at least I have
reason to suppose so

Then exclaimed Henry impetuously I will wring from him answers to
various questions which concern my peace and happiness

Please gentlemen said the woman Deborah making her appearance Sir
Francis Varney has gone out and he says I'm to show you all the door
as soon as it is convenient for you all to walk out of it

I feel convinced said Mr Chillingworth that it will be a useless
search now to attempt to find Sir Francis Varney here Let me beg of you
all to come away and believe me that I do not speak lightly or with a
view to get you from here when I say that after I have heard something
from you Henry which I shall ask you to relate to me painful though
it may be I shall be able to suggest some explanation of many things
which appear at present obscure and to put you in a course of freeing
you from the difficulties which surround you which Heaven knows I
little expected I should have it in my power to propose to any of you

I will follow your advice Mr Chillingworth said Henry for I have
always found that it has been dictated by good feeling as well as
correct judgment Admiral Bell you will oblige me much by coming away
with me now and at once

Well remarked the admiral if the doctor has really something to
say it alters the appearance of things and of course I have no
objection

Upon this the whole three of them immediately left the place and it
was evident that Mr Chillingworth had something of an uncomfortable
character upon his mind He was unusually silent and reserved and when
he did speak he seemed rather inclined to turn the conversation upon
indifferent topics than to add anything more to what he had said upon
the deeply interesting one which held so foremost a place in all their
minds

How is Flora now he asked of Henry since her removal

Anxious still said Henry but I think better

That is well I perceive that naturally we are all three walking
towards Bannerworth Hall and perhaps it is as well that on that spot
I should ask of you Henry to indulge me with a confidence such as
under ordinary circumstances I should not at all feel myself justified
in requiring of you

To what does it relate said Henry You may be assured Mr
Chillingworth that I am not likely to refuse my confidence to you whom
I have so much reason to respect as an attached friend of myself and my
family

You will not object likewise I hope added Mr Chillingworth to
extend that confidence to Admiral Bell for as you well know a truer
and more warm-hearted man than he does not exist

What do you expect for that doctor said the admiral

There is nothing said Henry that I could relate at all that I
should shrink from relating to Admiral Bell

Well my boy said the admiral and all I can reply to that is you
are quite right for there can be nothing that you need shrink from
telling me so far as regards the fact of trusting me with it goes

I am assured of that

A British officer once pledging his word prefers death to breaking
it Whatever you wish kept secret in the communication you make to me
say so and it will never pass my lips

Why sir the fact is said Henry that what I am about to relate to
you consists not so much of secrets as of matters which would be painful
to my feelings to talk of more than may be absolutely required

I understand you

Let me for a moment said Mr Chillingworth put myself right I do
not suspect Mr Henry Bannerworth that you fancy I ask you to make a
recital of circumstances which must be painful to you from any idle
motive But let me declare that I have now a stronger impulse which
induces me to wish to hear from your own lips those matters which
popular rumour may have greatly exaggerated or vitiated

It is scarcely possible remarked Henry sadly that popular rumour
should exaggerate the facts

Indeed

No They are unhappily of themselves in their bare truthfulness so
full of all that can be grievous to those who are in any way connected
with them that there needs no exaggeration to invest them with more
terror or with more of that sadness which must ever belong to a
recollection of them in my mind

In suchlike discourse as this the time was passed until Henry
Bannerworth and his friends once more reached the Hall from which he
with his family had so recently removed in consequence of the fearful
persecution to which they had been subjected

They passed again into the garden which they all knew so well and then
Henry paused and looked around him with a deep sigh

In answer to an inquiring glance from Mr Chillingworth he said 

Is it not strange now that I should have only been away from here a
space of time which may be counted by hours and yet all seems changed
I could almost fancy that years had elapsed since I had looked at it

Oh remarked the doctor time is always by the imagination measured
by the number of events which are crowded into a given space of it and
not by its actual duration Come into the house there you will find all
just as you left it Henry and you can tell us your story at leisure

The air said Henry about here is fresh and pleasant Let us sit
down in the summer-house yonder and there I will tell you all It has a
local interest too connected with the tale

This was agreed to and in a few moments the admiral Mr
Chillingworth and Henry were seated in the same summer-house which had
witnessed the strange interview between Sir Francis Varney and Flora
Bannerworth in which he had induced her to believe that he felt for the
distress he had occasioned her and was strongly impressed with the
injustice of her sufferings

Henry was silent for some few moments and then he said with a deep
sigh as he looked mournfully around him 

Illustration

It was on this spot that my father breathed his last and hence have I
said that it has a local interest in the tale I have to tell which
makes it the most fitting place in which to tell it

Oh said the admiral he died here did he

Yes where you are now sitting

Very good I have seen many a brave man die in my time and I hope to
see a few more although I grant you the death in the heat of
conflict and fighting for our country is a vastly different thing to
some shore-going mode of leaving the world

Yes said Henry as if pursuing his own meditations rather than
listening to the admiral Yes it was from this precise spot that my
father took his last look at the ancient house of his race What we can
now see of it he saw of it with his dying eyes and many a time I have
sat here and fancied the world of terrible thoughts that must at such a
moment have come across his brain

You might well do so said the doctor

You see added Henry that from here the fullest view you have of any
of the windows of the house is of that of Flora's room as we have
always called it because for years she had had it as her chamber and
when all the vegetation of summer is in its prime and the vine which
you perceive crawls over this summer-house is full of leaf and fruit
the view is so much hindered that it is difficult without making an
artificial gap in the clustering foliage to see anything but the
window

So I should imagine replied Mr Chillingworth

You doctor added Henry who know much of my family need not be
told what sort of man my father was

No indeed

But you Admiral Bell who do not know must be told and however
grievous it may be to me to have to say so I must inform you that he
was not a man who would have merited your esteem

Well said the admiral you know my boy that can make no difference
as regards you in anybody's mind who has got the brains of an owl
Every man's credit character and honour to my thinking is in his own
most special keeping and let your father be what he might or who he
might I do not see that any conduct of his ought to raise upon your
cheek the flush of shame or cost you more uneasiness than ordinary good
feeling dictates to the errors and feelings of a fellow creature

If all the world said Henry would take such liberal and
comprehensive views as you do admiral it would be much happier than it
is but such is not the case and people are but too apt to blame one
person for the evil that another has done

Ah but said Mr Chillingworth it so happens that those are the
people whose opinions are of the very least consequence

There is some truth in that said Henry sadly but however let me
proceed since I have to tell the tale I could wish it over My father
then Admiral Bell although a man not tainted in early life with vices
became by the force of bad associates and a sort of want of
congeniality and sentiment that sprang up between him and my mother
plunged into all the excesses of his age

These excesses were all of that character which the most readily lay
hold strongly of an unreflecting mind because they all presented
themselves in the garb of sociality

The wine cup is drained in the name of good fellowship money which is
wanted for legitimate purposes is squandered under the mask of a noble
and free generosity and all that the small imaginations of a number of
persons of perverted intellects could enable them to do has been done
from time to time to impart a kind of lustre to intemperance and all
its dreadful and criminal consequences

My father having once got into the company of what he considered wits
and men of spirit soon became thoroughly vitiated He was almost the
only one of the set among whom he passed what he considered his highly
convivial existence who was really worth anything pecuniarily
speaking There were some among them who might have been respectable
men and perchance carved their way to fortune as well as some others
who had started in life with good patrimonies but he my father at the
time he became associated with them was the only one as I say who to
use a phrase I have heard myself from his lips concerning them had got
a feather to fly with

The consequence of this was that his society merely for the sake of
the animal gratification of drinking at his expense was courted and he
was much flattered all of which he laid to the score of his own merits
which had been found out and duly appreciated by these bon vivants
while he considered that the grave admonitions of his real friends
proceeded from nothing in the world but downright envy and malice

Such a state of things as this could not last very long The associates
of my father wanted money as well as wine so they introduced him to the
gaming-table and he became fascinated with the fearful vice to an
extent which predicted his own destruction and the ruin of every one who
was in any way dependent upon him

He could not absolutely sell Bannerworth Hall unless I had given my
consent which I refused but he accumulated debt upon debt and from
time to time stripped the mansion of all its most costly contents

With various mutations of fortune he continued this horrible and
baneful career for a long time until at last he found himself utterly
and irretrievably ruined and he came home in an agony of despair being
so weak and utterly ruined in constitution that he kept his bed for
many days

It appeared however that something occurred at this juncture which
gave him actually or all events awakened a hope that he should possess
some money and be again in a position to try his fortune at the
gaming-table

He rose and fortifying himself once more with the strong stimulant of
wine and spirits he left his home and was absent for about two months

What occurred to him during that time we none of us ever knew but late
one night he came home apparently much flurried in manner and seeming
as if something had happened to drive him half mad

He would not speak to any one but he shut himself up the whole of the
night in the chamber where hangs the portrait that bears so strong a
resemblance to Sir Francis Varney and there he remained till the
morning when he emerged and said briefly that he intended to leave the
country

He was in a most fearful state of nervousness and my mother tells me
that he shook like one in an ague and started at every little sound
that occurred in the house and glared about him so wildly that it was
horrible to see him or to sit in the same apartment with him

She says that the whole morning passed on in this way till a letter
came to him the contents of which appeared to throw him into a perfect
convulsion of terror and he retired again to the room with the
portrait where he remained some hours and then he emerged looking
like a ghost so dreadfully pale and haggard was he

He walked into the garden here and was seen to sit down in this
summer-house and fix his eyes upon the window of that apartment

Henry paused for a few moments and then he added 

You will excuse me from entering upon any details of what next ensued
in the melancholy history My father here committed suicide He was
found dying and all I he words he spoke were The money is hidden'
Death claimed his victim and with a convulsive spasm he resigned his
spirit leaving what he had intended to say hidden in the oblivion of
the grave

That was an odd affair said the admiral

It was indeed We have all pondered deeply and the result was that
upon the whole we were inclined to come to an opinion that the words he
so uttered were but the result of the mental disturbance that at such a
moment might well be supposed to be ensuing in the mind and that they
related really to no foregone fact any more than some incoherent words
uttered by a man in a dream might be supposed to do

It may be so

I do not mean remarked Mr Chillingworth for one moment to attempt
to dispute Henry the rationality of such an opinion as you have just
given utterance to but you forget that another circumstance occurred
which gave a colour to the words used by your father

Yes I know to what you allude

Be so good as to state it to the admiral

I will On the evening of that same day there came a man here who in
seeming ignorance of what had occurred although by that time it was
well known to all the neighbourhood asked to see my father

Upon being told that he was dead he started back either with well
acted or with real surprise and seemed to be immensely chagrined He
then demanded to know if he had left any disposition of his property
but he got no information and departed muttering the most diabolical
oaths and curses that can be imagined He mounted his horse for he had
ridden to the Hall and his last words were as I am told 

'Where in the name of all that's damnable can he have put the
money'

And did you never find out who this man was asked the admiral

Never

It is an odd affair

It is said Mr Chillingworth and full of mystery The public mind
was much taken up at the time with some other matters or it would have
made the death of Mr Bannerworth the subject of more prolific comment
than it did As it was however a great deal was said upon the subject
and the whole comity was in a state of commotion for weeks afterwards

Yes said Henry it so happened that about that very time a murder
was committed in the neighbourhood of London which baffled all the
exertions of the authorities to discover the perpetrators of It was the
murder of Lord Lorne

Oh I remember said the admiral the newspapers were full of it for
a long time

They were and so as Mr Chillingworth says the more exciting
interest which that affair created drew off public attention in a great
measure from my father's suicide and we did not suffer so much from
public remark and from impertinent curiosity as might have been
expected

And in addition said Mr Chillingworth and he changed colour a
little as he spoke there was an execution shortly afterwards

Yes said Henry there was

The execution of a man named Angerstein added Mr Chillingworth for
a highway robbery attended with the most brutal violence

True all the affairs of that period of time are strongly impressed
upon my mind said Henry but you do not seem well Mr
Chillingworth

Oh yes I am quite well you are mistaken

Both the admiral and Henry looked scrutinizingly at the doctor who
certainly appeared to them to be labouring under some great mental
excitement which he found it almost beyond his power to repress

I tell you what it is doctor said the admiral I don't pretend and
never did to see further through a tar-barrel than my neighbours but I
can see far enough to feel convinced that you have got something on your
mind and that it somehow concerns this affair

Is it so said Henry

I cannot if I would said Mr Chillingworth and I may with truth
add that I would not if I could hide from you that I have something
on my mind connected with this affair but let me assure you it would be
premature of me to tell you of it

Premature be d  d said the admiral out with it

Nay nay dear sir I am not now in a position to say what is passing
through my mind

Alter your position then and be blowed cried Jack Pringle suddenly
stepping forward and giving the doctor such a push that he nearly went
through one of the sides of the summer-house

Why you scoundrel cried the admiral how came you here

On my legs said Jack Do you think nobody wants to know nothing but
yourself I'm as fond of a yarn as anybody

But if you are said Mr Chillingworth you had no occasion to come
against me as if you wanted to move a house

You said as you wasn't in a position to say something as I wanted to
hear so I thought I'd alter it for you

Is this fellow said the doctor shaking his head as he accosted the
admiral the most artful or stupid

A little of both said Admiral Bell a little of both doctor He's a
great fool and a great scamp

The same to you said Jack you're another I shall hate you
presently if you go on making yourself so ridiculous Now mind I'll
only give you a trial of another week or so and if you don't be more
purlite in your d n language I'll leave you

Away strolled Jack with his hands in his pockets towards the house
while the admiral was half choked with rage and could only glare after
him without the ability to say a word

Under any other circumstances than the present one of trouble and
difficulty and deep anxiety Henry Bannerworth must have laughed at
these singular little episodes between Jack and the admiral but his
mind was now by far too much harassed to permit him to do so

Let him go let him go my dear sir said Mr Chillingworth to the
admiral who showed some signs of an intention to pursue Jack he no
doubt has been drinking again

I'll turn him off the first moment I catch him sober enough to
understand me said the admiral

Well well do as you please but now let me ask a favour of both of
you

What is it

That you will leave Bannerworth Hall to me for a week

What for

I hope to make some discoveries connected with it which shall well
reward you for the trouble

It's no trouble said Henry and for myself I have amply sufficient
faith both in your judgment and in your friendship doctor to accede
to any request which you may make to me

And I said the admiral Be it so be it so For one week you say

Yes for one week I hope by the end of that time to have achieved
something worth the telling you of and I promise you that if I am at
all disappointed in my expectation that I will frankly and freely
communicate to you all I know and all I suspect

Then that's a bargain

It is

And what's to be done at once

Why nothing but to take the greatest possible care that Bannerworth
Hall is not left another hour without some one in it and in order that
such should be the case I have to request that you two will remain here
until I go to the town and make preparations for taking quiet
possession of it myself which I will do in the course of two hours at
most

Don't be longer said the admiral for I am so desperately hungry
that I shall certainly begin to eat somebody if you are

Depend upon me

Very well said Henry you may depend we will wait here until you
come back

The doctor at once hurried from the garden leaving Henry and the
admiral to amuse themselves as best they might with conjectures as to
what he was really about until his return




 LXII

THE MYSTERIOUS MEETING IN THE RUIN AGAIN THE vampire'S ATTACK UPON THE
CONSTABLE


Illustration

It is now necessary that we return once more to that mysterious ruin in
the intricacies of which Varney when pursued by the mob had succeeded
in finding a refuge which defied all the exertions which were made for
his discovery Our readers must be well aware that connected with that
ruin are some secrets of great importance to our story and we will
now at the solemn hour of midnight take another glance at what is
doing within its recesses

At that solemn hour it is not probable that any one would seek that
gloomy place from choice Some lover of the picturesque certainly might
visit it but such was not the inciting cause of the pilgrimage with
those who were soon to stand within its gloomy precincts

Other motives dictated their presence in that spot motives of rapine
peradventure of murder itself

As the neighbouring clocks sounded the hour of twelve and the faint
strokes were borne gently on the wind to that isolated ruin there might
have been seen a tall man standing by the porch of what had once been a
large doorway to some portion of the ruin

His form was enveloped in a large cloak which was of such ample
material that he seemed well able to wrap it several times around him
and then leave a considerable portion of it floating idly in the gentle
wind

He stood as still as calm and as motionless as a statue for a
considerable time before any degree of impatience began to show itself

Then he took from his pocket a large antique watch the white face of
which just enabled him to see what the time was and in a voice which
had in it some amount of petulance and anger he said 

Not come yet and nearly half an hour beyond the time What can have
detained him This is indeed trifling with the most important moments
of a man's existence

Even as he spoke he heard from some distance off the sound of a
short quick footstep He bent forwards to listen and then in a tone
of satisfaction he said 

He comes he comes

But he who thus waited for some confederate among these dim and old grey
ruins advanced not a step to meet him On the contrary such seemed the
amount of cold-blooded caution which he possessed that the nearer the
man who was evidently advancing got to the place the further back did
he who had preceded him shrink into the shadow of the dim and crumbling
walls which had for some years now past seemed to bend to the passing
blast and to be on the point of yielding to the destroying hand of
time

And yet surely he needed not have been so cautious Who was likely at
such an hour as that to come to the ruins but one who sought it by
appointment

And moreover the manner of the advancing man should have been quite
sufficient to convince him who waited that so much caution was
unnecessary but it was a part and parcel of his nature

About three minutes more sufficed to bring the second man to the ruin
and he at once and fearlessly plunged into its recesses

Who comes said the first man in a deep hollow voice

He whom you expect was the reply

Good he said and at once he now emerged from his hiding-place and
they stood together in the nearly total darkness with which the place
was enshrouded for the night was a cloudy one and there appeared not a
star in the heavens to shed its faint light upon the scene below

For a few moments they were both silent for he who had last arrived had
evidently made great exertions to reach the spot and was breathing
laboriously while he who was there first appeared from some natural
taciturnity of character to decline opening the conversation

At length the second comer spoke saying 

I have made some exertion to get here to my time and yet I am beyond
it as you are no doubt aware

Yes yes

Well such would not have been the case but yet I stayed to bring you
some news of importance

Indeed

It is so This place which we have now for some time had as a quiet
and perfectly eligible one of meeting is about to be invaded by one of
those restless troublesome spirits who are never happy but when they
are contriving something to the annoyance of others who do not interfere
with them

Explain yourself more fully

I will At a tavern in the town there has happened some strange scenes
of violence in consequence of the general excitement into which the
common people have been thrown upon the dreadful subject of vampires

Well

The consequence is that numerous arrests have taken place and the
places of confinement for offenders against the laws are now full of
those whose heated and angry imaginations have induced them to take
violent steps to discover the reality or the falsehood of rumours which
so much affected them their wives and their families that they feared
to lie down to their night's repose

The other laughed a short hollow restless sort of laugh which had not
one particle of real mirth in it

Go on go on he said What did they do

Immense excesses have been committed but what made me first of all
stay beyond my time was that I overheard a man declare his intentions
this night from twelve till the morning and for some nights to come
to hold watch and ward for the vampire

Indeed

Yes He did but stay at the earnest solicitation of his comrades to
take yet another glass ere he came upon his expedition

He must be met The idiot what business is it of his

There are always people who will make everything their business
whether it be so or not

There are Let us retire further into the recesses of the ruin and
there consider as well what is to be done regarding more important
affairs as with this rash intruder here

They both walked for some twenty paces or so right into the ruin and
then he who had been there first said suddenly to his companion 

I am annoyed although the feeling reaches no further than annoyance
for I have a natural love of mischief to think that my reputation has
spread so widely and made so much noise

Your reputation as a vampire Sir Francis Varney you mean

Yes but there is no occasion for you to utter my name aloud even here
where we are alone together

It came out unawares

Unawares Can it be possible that you have so little command over
yourself as to allow a name to come from your lips unawares

Sometimes

I am surprised

Well it cannot be helped What do you now propose to do

Nay you are my privy councillor Have you no deep-laid artful project
in hand Can you not plan and arrange something which may yet have the
effect of accomplishing what at first seemed so very simple but which
has from one unfortunate circumstance and another become full of
difficulty and pregnant with all sorts of dangers

I must confess I have no plan

I listen with astonishment

Nay now you are jesting

When did you ever hear of me jesting

Not often I admit But you have a fertile genius and I have always
myself found it easier to be the executive than to plan an elaborate
course of action for others

Then you throw it all on me

I throw a weight naturally enough upon the shoulders which I think
the best adapted to sustain it

Be it so then be it so

You are I presume from what you say provided with a scheme of action
which shall present better hopes of success at less risk I hope Look
what great danger we have already passed through

Yes we have

I pray you avoid that in the next campaign

It is not the danger that annoys and troubles me but it is that
notwithstanding it the object is as far off as ever from being
attained

And not only so but as is invariably the case under such
circumstances we have made it more difficult of execution because we
have put those upon their guard thoroughly who are the most likely to
oppose us

We have we have

And placed the probability of success afar off indeed

And yet I have set my life upon the cast and I will stand the hazard
I tell you I will accomplish this object or I will perish in the
attempt

You are too enthusiastic

Not at all Nothing has been ever done the execution of which was
difficult without enthusiasm I will do what I intend or Bannerworth
Hall shall become a heap of ruins where fire shall do its worst work of
devastation and I will myself find a grave in the midst

Well I quarrel with no man for chalking out the course he intends to
pursue but what do you mean to do with the prisoner below here

Kill him

What

I say kill him Do you not understand me

I do indeed

When everything else is secured and when the whole of that which I so
much court and which I will have is in my possession I will take his
life or you shall Ay you are just the man for such a deed A
smooth-faced specious sort of roan are you and you like not danger
There will be none in taking the life of a man who is chained to the
floor of a dungeon

I know not why said the other you take a pleasure on this
particular night of all others in saying all you can which you think
will be offensive to me

Now how you wrong me This is the reward of confidence

I don't want such confidence

Why you surely don't want me to flatter you

No but 

Psha Hark you That admiral is the great stumbling-block in my way I
should ere this have had undisturbed possession of Bannerworth Hall but
for him He must be got out of the way somehow

A short time will tire him out of watching He is one of those men of
impulse who soon become wearied of inaction

Ay and then the Bannerworths return to the Hall

It may be so

I am certain of it We have been out-generalled in this matter
although I grant we did all that men could do to give us success

In what way would you get rid of this troublesome admiral

I scarcely know A letter from his nephew might if well put together
get him to London

I doubt it I hate him mortally He has offended me more than once most
grievously

I know it He saw through you

I do not give him so much credit He is a suspicious man and a vain
and a jealous one

And yet he saw through you Now listen to me You are completely at
fault and have no plan of operations whatever in your mind What I want
you to do is to disappear from the neighbourhood for a time and so
will I As for our prisoner here below I cannot see what else can be
done with him than than 

Than what Do you hesitate

I do

Then what is it you were about to say

I cannot but feel that all we have done hitherto as regards this young
prisoner of ours has failed He has with a determined obstinacy set
at naught as well you know all threats

He has

He has refused to do one act which could in any way aid me in my
objects In fact from the first to the last he has been nothing but an
expense and an encumbrance to us both

All that is strictly true

And yet although you as well as I know of a marvellously ready way
of getting rid of such encumbrances I must own that I shrink with more
than a feeling of reluctance from the murder of the youth

You contemplated it then asked the other

No I cannot be said to have contemplated it That is not the proper
sort of expression to use

What is then

To contemplate a deed seems to me to have some close connexion to the
wish to do it

And you have no such wish

I have no such wish and what is more I will not do it

Then that is sufficient and the only question that remains for you to
confide is what you will do It is far easier in all enterprises to
decide upon what we will not do than upon what we will For my own part
I must say that I can perceive no mode of extricating ourselves from
this involvement with anything like safety

Then it must be done with something like danger

As you please

You say so and your words bear a clear enough signification but from
your tone I can guess how much you are dissatisfied with the aspect of
affairs

Dissatisfied

Yes I say dissatisfied Be frank and own that which it is in vain to
conceal from me I know you too well arch hypocrite as you are and
fully capable of easily deceiving many you cannot deceive me

I really cannot understand you

Then I will take care that you shall

How

Listen I will not have the life of Charles Holland taken

Who wishes to take it

You

There indeed you wrong me Unless you yourself thought that such an
act was imperatively called for by the state of affairs do you think
that I would needlessly bring down upon my head the odium as well as the
danger of such a deed No no Let him live if you are willing he may
live a thousand years for all I care

'Tis well I am mark me not only willing but I am determined that he
shall live so far as we are concerned I can respect the courage that
even when he considered that his life was at stake enabled him to say
no to a proposal which was cowardly and dishonourable although it went
far to the defeat of my own plans and has involved me in much trouble

Hush hush

What is it

I fancy I hear a footstep

Indeed that were a novelty in such a place as this

And yet not more than I expected Have you forgotten what I told you
when I reached here to-night after the appointed hour

Truly I had for the moment Do you think then that the footstep which
now meets our ears is that of the adventurer who boasted that he could
keep watch for the vampire

In faith do I What is to be done with such a meddling fool

He ought certainly to be taught not to be so fond of interfering with
other people's affairs

Certainly

Perchance the lesson will not be wholly thrown away upon others It may
be worth while to take some trouble with this poor valiant fellow and
let him spread his news so as to stop any one else from being equally
venturous and troublesome

A good thought

Shall it be done

Yes if you will arrange that which shall accomplish such a result

Be it so The moon rises soon

It does

Ah already I fancy I see a brightening of the air as if the mellow
radiance of the queen of night were already quietly diffusing itself
throughout the realms of space Come further within the ruins

They both walked further among the crumbling walls and fragments of
columns with which the place abounded As they did so they paused now
and then to listen and more than once they both heard plainly the sound
of certain footsteps immediately outside the once handsome and spacious
building

Varney the vampire who had been holding this conversation with no
other than Marchdale smiled as he in a whispered voice told the
latter what to do in order to frighten away from the place the foolhardy
man who thought that by himself he should be able to accomplish
anything against the vampire

It was indeed a hair-brained expedition for whether Sir Francis
Varney was really so awful and preternatural a being as so many
concurrent circumstances would seem to proclaim or not he was not a
likely being to allow himself to be conquered by anyone individual let
his powers or his courage be what they might

What induced this man to become so ventursome we shall now proceed to
relate as well as what kind of reception he got in the old ruins
which since the mysterious disappearance of Sir Francis Varney within
their recesses had possessed so increased a share of interest and
attracted so much popular attention and speculation




 LXIII

THE GUESTS AT THE INN AND THE STORY OF THE DEAD UNCLE


Illustration

As had been truly stated by Mr Marchdale who now stands out in his
true colours to the reader as the confidant and abettor of Sir Francis
Varney there had assembled on that evening a curious and a gossipping
party at the inn where such dreadful and such riotous proceedings had
taken place which in their proper place we have already duly and at
length recorded

It was not very likely that on that evening or for many and many an
evening to come the conversation in the parlour of the inn would be
upon any other subject than that of the vampire

Indeed the strange mysterious and horrible circumstances which had
occurred bade fair to be gossipping stock in trade for many a year

Never before had a subject presenting so many curious features arisen
Never within the memory of that personage who is supposed to know
everything had there occurred any circumstance in the county or set of
circumstances which afforded such abundant scope for conjecture and
speculation

Everybody might have his individual opinion and be just as likely to be
right as his neighbours and the beauty of the affair was that such was
the interest of the subject itself that there was sure to be a kind of
reflected interest with every surmise that at all bore upon it

Illustration

On this particular night when Marchdale was prowling about gathering
what news he could in order that he might carry it to the vampire a
more than usually strong muster of the gossips of the town took place

Indeed all of any note in the talking way were there with the
exception of one and he was in the county gaol being one of the
prisoners apprehended by the military when they made the successful
attack upon the lumber-room of the inn after the dreadful desecration
of the dead which had taken place

The landlord of the inn was likely to make a good thing of it for
talking makes people thirsty and he began to consider that a vampire
about once a-year would be no bad thing for the Blue Lion

It's shocking said one of the guests it's shocking to think of
Only last night I am quite sure I had such a fright that it added at
least ten years to my age

A fright said several

I believe I speak English I said a fright

Well but had it anything to do with the vampire

Everything

Oh do tell us do tell us all about it How was it Did he come to
you Go on Well well

The first speaker became immediately a very important personage in the
room and when he saw that he became at once a very important
personage in his own eyes likewise and before he would speak another
word he filled a fresh pipe and ordered another mug of ale

It's no use trying to hurry him said one

No he said it isn't I'll tell you in good time what a dreadful
circumstance has made me sixty-three to-day when I was only fifty-three
yesterday

Was it very dreadful

Rather You wouldn't have survived it at all

Indeed

No Now listen I went to bed at a quarter after eleven as usual I
didn't notice anything particular in the room

Did you peep under the bed

No I didn't Well as I was a-saying to bed I went and I didn't
fasten the door because being a very sound sleeper in case there was
a fire I shouldn't hear a word of it if I did

No said another I recollect once 

Be so good as allow me to finish what I know before you begin to
recollect anything if you please As I was saying I didn't lock the
door but I went to bed Somehow or another I did not feel at all
comfortable and I tossed about first on one side and then on the
other but it was all in vain I only got every moment more and more
fidgetty

And did you think of the vampire said one of the listeners

I thought of nothing else till I heard my clock which is on the
landing of the stairs above my bed-room begin to strike twelve

Ah I like to hear a clock sound in the night said one it puts one
in mind of the rest of the world and lets one know one isn't all
alone

Very good The striking of the clock I should not at all have objected
to but it was what followed that did the business

What what

Fair and softly fair and softly Just hand me a light Mr Sprigs if
you please I'll tell you all gentlemen in a moment or two

With the most provoking deliberation the speaker re-lit his pipe which
had gone out while he was talking and then after a few whiffs to
assure himself that its contents had thoroughly ignited he resumed 

No sooner had the last sound of it died away than I heard something on
the stairs

Yes yes

It was as if some man had given his foot a hard blow against one of the
stairs and he would have needed to have had a heavy boot on to do it I
started up in bed and listened as you may well suppose not in the most
tranquil state of mind and then I heard an odd gnawing sort of noise
and then another dab upon one of the stairs

How dreadful

It was What to do I knew not or what to think except that the
vampire had by some means got in at the attic window and was coming
down stairs to my room That seemed the most likely Then there was
another groan and then another heavy step and as they were evidently
coming towards my door I felt accordingly and got out of bed not
knowing hardly whether I was on my head or my heels to try and lock my
door

Ah to be sure

Yes that was all very well if I could have done it but a man in such
a state of mind as I was in is not a very sharp hand at doing anything
I shook from head to foot The room was very dark and I couldn't for a
moment or two collect my senses sufficient really to know which way the
door lay

What a situation

It was Dab dab dab came these horrid footsteps and there was I
groping about the room in an agony I heard them coming nearer and
nearer to my door Another moment and they must have reached it when
my hand struck against the lock

What an escape

No it was not

No

No indeed The key was on the outside and you may well guess I was
not over and above disposed to open the door to get at it

No no

I felt regularly bewildered I can tell you it seemed to me as if the
very devil himself was coming down stairs hopping all the way upon one
leg

How terrific

I felt my senses almost leaving me but I did what I could to hold the
door shut just as I heard the strange step come from the last stair on
to the landing Then there was a horrid sound and some one began trying
the lock of my door

What a moment

Yes I can tell you it was a moment Such a moment as I don't wish to
go through again I held the door as close as I could and did not
speak I tried to cry out help and murder but I could not my tongue
stuck to the roof of my mouth and my strength was fast failing me

Horrid horrid

Take a drop of ale

Thank you Well I don't think this went on above two or three minutes
and all the while some one tried might and main to push open the door
My strength left me all at once I had only time to stagger back a step
or two and then as the door opened I fainted away

Well well

Ah you wouldn't have said well if you had been there I can tell
you

No but what become of you What happened next How did it end What
was it

Why what exactly happened next after I fainted I cannot tell you but
the first thing I saw when I recovered was a candle

Yes yes

And then a crowd of people

Ah ah

And then Dr Web

Gracious

And Mrs Bulk my housekeeper I was in my own bed and when I opened
my eyes I heard Dr Webb say 

'He will be better soon Can no one form any idea of what it is all
about Some sudden fright surely could alone have produced such an
effect'

'The Lord have mercy upon me said I

Upon this everybody who had been called in got round the bed and
wanted to know what had happened but I said not a word of it but
turning to Mrs Bulk I asked her how it was she found out I had
fainted

'Why sir says she I was coming up to bed as softly as I could
because I knew you had gone to rest some time before The clock was
striking twelve and as I went past it some of my clothes I suppose
caught the large weight but it was knocked off and down the stairs it
rolled going with such a lump from one to the other and I couldn't
catch it because it rolled so fast that I made sure you would be
awakened so I came down to tell you what it was and it was some time
before I could get your room door open and when I did I found you out
of bed and insensible'

There was a general look of disappointment when this explanation was
given and one said 

Then it was not the vampire

Certainly not

And after all only a clock weight

That's about it

Why didn't you tell us that at first

Because that would have spoilt the story

There was a general murmur of discontent and after a few moments one
man said with some vivacity 

Well although our friend's vampire has turned out after all to be
nothing but a confounded clock-weight there's no disputing the fact
about Sir Francis Varney being a vampire and not a clock-weight

Very true very true

And what's to be done to rid the town of such a man

Oh don't call him a man

Well a monster

Ah that's more like I tell you what sir if you had got a light
when you first heard the noise in your room and gone out to see what it
was you would have spared yourself much fright

Ah no doubt it's always easy afterwards to say if you had done this
and if you had done the other so and so would have been the effect but
there is something about the hour of midnight that makes men tremble

Well said one who had not yet spoken I don't see why twelve at
night should be a whit more disagreeable than twelve at day

Don't you

Not I

Now for instance many a party of pleasure goes to that old ruin where
Sir Francis Varney so unaccountably disappeared in broad daylight But
is there any one here who would go to it alone and at midnight

Yes

Who

I would

What and after what has happened as regards the vampire in connection
with it

Yes I would

I'll bet you twenty shilling you won't

And I and I cried several

Well gentlemen said the man who certainly shewed no signs of fear
I will go and not only will I go and take all your bets but if I do
meet the vampire then I'll do my best to take him prisoner

And when will you go

To-night he cried and he sprang to his feet hark ye all I don't
believe one word about vampires I'll go at once it's getting late and
let any one of you in order that you may be convinced I have been to
the place give me any article which I will hide among the ruins and
tell you where to find it to-morrow in broad daylight

Well said one that's fair Tom Eccles Here's a handkerchief of
mine I should know it again among a hundred others

Agreed I'll leave it in the ruins

The wagers were fairly agreed upon several handkerchiefs were handed to
Tom Eccles and at eleven o'clock he fairly started through the murky
darkness of the night to the old ruin where Sir Francis Varney and
Marchdale were holding their most unholy conference

It is one thing to talk and to accept wagers in the snug parlour of an
inn and another to go alone across a tract of country wrapped in the
profound stillness of night to an ancient ruin which in addition to the
natural gloom which might well be supposed to surround it has
superadded associations which are anything but of a pleasant character

Tom Eccles as he was named was one of those individuals who act
greatly from impulse He was certainly not a coward and perhaps
really as free from superstition as most persons but he was human and
consequently he had nerves and he had likewise an imagination

He went to his house first before he started on his errand to the ruins
It was to get a horse-pistol which he had and which he duly loaded and
placed in his pocket Then he wrapped himself up in a great-coat and
with the air of a man quite determined upon something desperate he left
the town

The guests at the inn looked after him as he walked from the door of
that friendly establishment and some of them as they saw his resolved
aspect began to quake for the amount of the wagers they had laid upon
his non-success

However it was resolved among them that they would stay until
half-past twelve in the expectation of his return before they
separated

To while away the time he who had been so facetious about his story of
the clock-weight volunteered to tell what happened to a friend of his
who went to take possession of some family property which he became
possessed of as heir-at-law to an uncle who had died without a will
having an illegitimate family unprovided for in every shape

Ah nobody cares for other people's illegitimate children and if
their parents don't provide for them why the workhouse is open for
them just as if they were something different from other people

So they are if their parents don't take care of them and provide for
them nobody else will as you say neighbour except when they have a
Fitz put to their name which tells you they are royal bastards and of
course unlike anybody else's

But go on let's know all about it we  hear what he has got to
say at all at this rate

Well as I was saying or about to say the nephew as soon as he heard
his uncle was dead comes and claps his seal upon everything in the
house

But could he do so inquired one of the guests

I don't see what was to hinder him replied a third He could do so
certainly

But there was a son and as I take it a son's nearer than a nephew
any day

But the son is illegitimate

Legitimate or illegitimate a son's a son don't bother me about
distinction of that sort why now there was old Weatherbit 

Order order

Let's hear the tale

Very good gentlemen I'll go on if I ain't to be interrupted but
I'll say this that an illegitimate son is no son in the eyes of the
law or at most he's an accident quite and ain't what he is and so
can't inherit

Well that's what I call making matters plain said one of the guests
who took his pipe from his mouth to make room for the remark now that
is what I likes

Well as I have proved then resumed the speaker the nephew was the
heir and into the house he would come A fine affair it was too the
illegitimates looking the colour of sloes but he knew the law and
would have it put in force

Law's law you know

Uncommonly true that and the nephew stuck to it like a cobbler to his
last he said they should go out and they did go out and say what
they would about their natural claims he would not listen to them but
bundled them out and out in a pretty short space of time

It was trying to them mind you to leave the house they had been born
in with very different expectations to those which now appeared to be
their fate Poor things they looked ruefully enough and well they
might for there was a wide world for them and no prospect of a warm
corner

Well as I was saying he had them all out and the house clear to
himself

Now said he I have an open field and no favour I don't care for
no Eh what

There was a sudden knocking he thought the door and went and opened
it but nothing was to be seen

Oh I see somebody next door and if it wasn't it don't matter
There's nobody here I'm alone and there's plenty of valuables in the
house That is what I call very good company I wouldn't wish for
better

He turned about looked over room after room and satisfied himself that
he was alone that the house was empty

At every room he entered he paused to think over the value what it was
worth and that he was a very fortunate man in having dropped into such
a good thing

Ah there's the old boy's secretary too his bureau there'll be
something in that that will amuse me mightily but I don't think I shall
sit up late He was a rum old man to say the least of it a very odd
sort of man

With that he gave himself a shrug as if some very uncomfortable feeling
had come over him

I'll go to bed early and get some sleep and then in daylight I can
look after these papers They won't be less interesting in the morning
than they are now

There had been some rum stories about the old man and now the nephew
seemed to think he might have let the family sleep on the premises for
that night yes at that moment he could have found it in his heart to
have paid for all the expense of their keep had it been possible to
have had them back to remain the night

But that wasn't possible for they would not have done it but sooner
have remained in the streets all night than stay there all night like
so many house-dogs employed by one who stepped in between them and
their father's goods which were their inheritance but for one trifling
circumstance a mere ceremony

The night came on and he had lights True it was he had not been down
stairs only just to have a look He could not tell what sort of a place
it was there were a good many odd sort of passages that seemed to end
nowhere and others that did

There were large doors but they were all locked and he had the keys
so he didn't mind but secured all places that were not fastened

He then went up stairs again and sat down in the room where the bureau
was placed

I'll be bound said one of the guests he was in a bit of a stew
notwithstanding all his brag

Oh I don't believe said another that anything done that is
dangerous or supposed to be dangerous by the bravest man is any way
wholly without some uncomfortable feelings They may not be strong
enough to prevent the thing proposed to be done from being done but
they give a disagreeable sensation to the skin

You have felt it then

Ha ha ha

Why at that time I slept in the churchyard for a wager I must say I
felt cold all over as if my skin was walking about me in an
uncomfortable manner

But you won your wager

I did

And of course you slept there

To be sure I did

And met with nothing

Nothing save a few bumps against the gravestones

Those were hard knocks I should say

They were I assure you but I lay there and slept there and won my
wager

Would you do it again

No

And why not

Because of the rheumatism

You caught that

I did I would give ten times my wager to get rid of them I have them
very badly

Come order order the tale let's hear the end of that since it has
begun

With all my heart Come neighbour

Well as I said he was fidgetty but yet he was not a man to be very
easily frightened or overcome for he was stout and bold

When he shut himself up in the room he took out a bottle of some good
wine and helped himself to drink it was good old wine and he soon
felt himself warmed and comforted He could have faced the enemy

If one bottle produces such an effect he muttered what will two
do

This was a question that could only be solved by trying it and this he
proceeded to do

But first he drew a brace of long barrelled pistols from his coat
pocket and taking a powder-flask and bullets from his pocket also he
loaded them very carefully

There said he are my bull-dogs and rare watch-dogs they are They
never bark but they bite Now if anybody does come it will be all up
with them Tricks upon travellers ain't a safe game when I have these
and now for the other bottle

He drew the other bottle and thought if anything it was better than
the first He drank it rather quick to be sure and then he began to
feel sleepy and tired

I think I shall go to bed he said that is if I can find my way
there for it does seem to me as if the door was travelling Never mind
it will make a call here again presently and then I'll get through

So saying he arose Taking the candle in his hand he walked with a
better step than might have been expected under the circumstance True
it was the candle wagged to and fro and his shadow danced upon the
wall but still when he got to the bed he secured his door put the
light in a safe place threw himself down and was fast asleep in a few
moments or rather he fell into a doze instantaneously

How long he remained in this state he knew not but he was suddenly
awakened by a loud bang as though something heavy and flat had fallen
upon the floor such for instance as a door or anything of that sort
He jumped up rubbed his eyes and could even then hear the
reverberations through the house

What is that he muttered what is that

He listened and thought he could hear something moving down stairs and
for a moment he was seized with an ague fit but recollecting I
suppose that there were some valuables down stairs that were worth
fighting for he carefully extinguished the light that still burned and
softly crept down stairs

When he got down stairs he thought he could hear some one scramble up
the kitchen stairs and then into the room where the bureau was
Listening for a moment to ascertain if there were more than one and
then feeling convinced there was not he followed into the parlour when
he heard the cabinet open by a key

This was a new miracle and one he could not understand and then he
heard the papers begin to rattle and rustle so drawing out one of the
pistols he cocked it and walked in

The figure instantly began to jump about it was dressed in white in
grave-clothes He was terribly nervous and shook so he feared to fire
the pistol but at length he did and the report was followed by a fall
and a loud groan

This was very dreadful very dreadful but all was quiet and he lit the
candle again and approached the body to examine it and ascertain if he
knew who it was A groan came from it The bureau was open and the
figure clutched firmly a will in his hand

The figure was dressed in grave-clothes and he started up when he saw
the form and features of his own uncle the man who was dead who
somehow or other had escaped his confinement and found his way up
here He held his will firmly and the nephew was so horrified and
stunned that he threw down the light and rushed out of the room with a
shout of terror and never returned again

                                   

The narrator concluded and one of the guests said 

And do you really believe it No no to be sure not

You don't Why should I My friend was out of all hand one of the
greatest liars I ever came near and why therefore should I believe
him I don't on my conscience believe one word of it

It was now half-past twelve and as Tom Eccles came not back and the
landlord did not feel disposed to draw any more liquor they left the
inn and retired to their separate houses in a great state of anxiety to
know the fate of their respective wagers




 LXIV

THE VAMPIRE IN THE MOONLIGHT THE FALSE FRIEND


Illustration

Part of the distance being accomplished towards the old ruins Tom
Eccles began to feel that what he had undertaken was not altogether such
child's-play as he had at first imagined it to be Somehow or another
with a singular and uncomfortable sort of distinctness there came
across his mind every story that he had remembered of the wild and the
wonderful All the long-since forgotten tales of superstition that in
early childhood he had learned came now back upon him suggesting to
his mind a thousand uncomfortable fancies of the strangest description

It was not likely that when once a man under such circumstances got
into such a frame of mind he would readily get out of it again while
he continued surrounded by such scenes as had first called them into
existence

No doubt had he turned about and faced the inn again instead of the
old ruins he would soon have shaken off these thick coming fancies
but such a result was no to be expected so long as he kept on towards
the dismal place he had pledged himself to reach

As he traversed meadow after meadow he began to ask himself some
questions which he found that he could not answer exactly in a
consolatory manner under the present state of things

Among these question was the very pertinent one of It's no argument
against vampires because I don't see the use of em is it This he
was compelled to answer as he had put it and when in addition he
began to recollect that without the shadow of a doubt Sir Francis
Varney the supposed vampire had been chased across the fields to that
very ruin whither he was bound and had then and there disappeared he
certainly found himself in decidedly uncomfortable and most unpromising
situation

No he said no Hang it I won't go back now to be made the
laughing-stock of the whole town which I should be Come what may of
it I will go on as I have commenced so I shall put on as stout a heart
as I can

Then having come to this resolve he strove might and main to banish
from his mind those disagreeable reminiscences that had been oppressing
him to turn his attention to subjects of a different complexion

During the progress of making this endeavour which was rather futile
he came within sight of the ruins Then he slackened his pace a little
telling himself with a pardonable self-deceit that it was common
ordinary caution only which induced him to do so and nothing at all in
the shape of fear

Time enough he remarked to be afraid when I see anything to be
afraid of which I don't see as yet So as all's right I may as well
put a good face upon the matter

He tried to whistle a tune but it turned out only a melancholy failure
so he gave that up in despair and walked on until he got within a
hundred yards or thereabouts of the old ruins

He thus proceeded and bending his ear close to the ground he listened
attentively for several minutes Somehow he fancied that a strange
murmuring sound came to his ears but he was not quite sure that it
proceeded from the ruins because it was just that sort of sound that
might come from a long way off being mellowed by distance although
perhaps loud enough at its source

Well well he whispered to himself it don't matter much after all
Go I must and hide the handkerchiefs somewhere or else be laughed at
besides losing my wages The former I don't like and the latter I
cannot afford

Thus clinching the matter by such knock-down arguments he walked on
until he was almost within the very shadow of the ruins and probably
it was at this juncture that his footsteps may have been heard by
Marchdale and Sir Francis Varney

Then he paused again but all was profoundly still and he began to
think that the strange sort of murmuring noise which he had heard must
have come from far off and not at all from any person or persons within
the ruins

Let me see he said to himself I have five handkerchiefs to hide
among the old ruins somewhere and the sooner I do so the better
because then I will get away for as regards staying here to watch
Heaven knows how long for Sir Francis Varney I don't intend to do it
upon second thoughts and second thoughts they say are generally best

With the most careful footsteps now as if he were treading upon some
fragile substance which he feared to injure he advanced until he was
fairly within the precincts of the ancient place which now bore so ill
a reputation

He then made to himself much the same remark that Sir Francis Varney had
made to Marchdale with respect to the brightening up of the sky in
consequence of its being near the time for the moon to rise from the
horizon and he saw more clearly around him although he could not find
any good place to hide the handkerchiefs in

I must and will he said hide them securely for it would indeed
be remarkably unpleasant after coming here and winning my wages to
have the proofs that I had done so taken away by some chance visitor to
the place

He at length saw a tolerably large stone which stood in a slant
position up against one of the walls Its size attracted him He
thought if his strength was sufficient to move it that it would be a
good thing to do so and to place the handkerchiefs beneath it for at
all events it was so heavy that it could not be kicked aside and no
one without some sort of motive to do so beyond the mere love of
labour would set about moving it from its position

I may go further and fare worse he said to himself so here shall
all the handkerchiefs lie to afford a proof that I have been here

He packed them into a small compass and then stooped to roll aside the
heavy stone when at the moment before he could apply his strength to
that purpose he heard some one in his immediate neighbourhood
say Hist

This was so sudden and so utterly unexpected that he not only ceased
his exertions to move the stone but he nearly fell down in his
surprise

Hist hist said the voice again

What what gasped Tom Eccles what are you Hush hush hush

The perspiration broke out upon his brow and he leaned against the wall
for support as he managed to say faintly 

Well hush what then Hist

Well I hear you Where are you

Here at hand Who are you

Tom Eccles Who are you A friend Have you seen anything

No I wish I could I should like to see you if I could I'm
coming

There was a slow and cautious footstep and Marchdale advanced to where
Tom Eccles was standing

Come now said the latter when he saw the dusky-looking form
stalking towards him till I know you better I'll be obliged to you to
keep off I am well armed Keep your distance be you friend or foe

Armed exclaimed Marchdale and he at once paused Yes I am

But I am a friend I have no sort of objection frankly to tell you my
errand I am a friend of the Bannerworth family and have kept watch
here now for two nights in the hopes of meeting with Varney the
vampire

The deuce you have and pray what may your name be Marchdale

If you be Mr Marchdale I know you by sight for I have seen you with
Mr Henry Bannerworth several times Come out from among the shadows
and let us have a look at you but till you do don't come within arm's
length of me I am not naturally suspicious but we cannot be too
careful

Oh certainly certainly The silver edge of the moon is now just
peeping up from the east and you will be able to see me well if you
step from the shadow of the wall by which you now are

This was a reasonable enough proposition and Tom Eccles at once acceded
to it by stepping out boldly into the partial moonlight which now
began to fall upon the open meadows tinting the grass with a silvery
refulgence and rendering even minute objects visible The moment he saw
Marchdale he knew him and advancing frankly to him he said 

I know you sir well

And what brings you here A wager for one thing and a wish to see
the vampire for another

Indeed Yes I must own I have such a wish along with a still
stronger one to capture him if possible and as there are now two of
us why may we not do it

As for capturing him said Marchdale I should prefer shooting
him You would

I would indeed I have seen him once shot down and he is now I have
no doubt as well as ever What were you doing with that huge stone I
saw you bending over I have some handkerchiefs to hide here as a
proof that I have to-night really been to this place

Oh I will show you a better spot where there is a crevice in which
you can place them with perfect safety Will you walk with me into the
ruins Willingly

It's odd enough remarked Marchdale after he had shown Tom Eccles
where to hide the handkerchiefs that you and I should both be here
upon so similar an errand I'm very glad of it It robs the place of
its gloom and makes it ten times more endurable than it otherwise would
be What do you propose to do if you see the vampire

I shall try a pistol bullet on him You say you are armed Yes

With pistols One Here it is

A huge weapon loaded well of course Oh yes I can depend upon
it but I did not intend to use it unless assailed

'Tis well What is that What what

Don't you see anything there Come farther back Look look At the
corner of that wall there I am certain there is the flutter of a human
garment There is there is

Hush Keep close It must be the vampire Give me my pistol What
are you doing with it

Only ramming down the charge more firmly for you Take it If that be
Varney the vampire I shall challenge him to surrender the moment he
appears and if he does not I will fire upon him and do you do so
likewise Well I I don't know

You have scruples I certainly have

Well well don't you fire then but leave it to me There
look look Now have you any doubt There he goes in his cloak It
is it is   Varney by Heavens cried Tom Eccles

Illustration

Surrender shouted Marchdale

At the instant Sir Francis Varney sprang forward and made off at a
rapid pace across the meadows

Fire after him fire cried Marchdale or he will escape My pistol
has missed fire He will be off

On the impulse of the moment and thus urged by the voice and the
gesture of his companion Tom Eccles took aim as well as he could and
fired after the retreating form of Sir Francis Varney His conscience
smote him as he heard the report and saw the flash of the large pistol
amid the half sort of darkness that was still around

The effect of the shot was then to him painfully apparent He saw Varney
stop instantly then make a vain attempt to stagger forward a little
and finally fall heavily to the earth with all the appearance of one
killed upon the spot

You have hit him said Marchdale you have hit him Bravo I
have hit him

Yes a capital shot by Jove I am very sorry

Sorry sorry for ridding the world of such a being What was in your
pistol A couple of slugs

Well they have made a lodgment in him that's quite clear Let's go up
and finish him at once He seems finished

I beg your pardon there When the moonbeams fall upon him he'll get up
and walk away as if nothing was the matter Will he cried Tom with
animation will he

Certainly he will Thank God for that Now hark you Mr Marchdale
I should not have fired if you had not at the moment urged me to do so
Now I shall stay and see if the effect which you talk of will ensue
and although it may convince me that he is a vampire and that there are
such things he may go off scot free for me

Go off Yes I don't want to have even a vampire's blood upon my
hands

You are exceedingly delicate Perhaps I am it's my way though I
have shot him not you mind so in a manner of speaking he belongs to
me Now mark me I won't have him touched any more to-night unless
you think there's a chance of making a prisoner of him without
violence

There he lies you can go and make a prisoner of him at once dead as
he is and if you take him out of the moonlight 

I understand he won't recover Certainly not

But as I want him to recover that don't suit me Well I cannot
but honour your scruples although I do not actually share in them but
I promise you that since such is your wish I will take no steps
against the vampire but let us come up to him and see if he be really
dead or only badly wounded

Tom Eccles hang back a little from this proposal but upon being urged
again by Marchdale and told that he need not go closer than he chose
he consented and the two of them approached the prostrate form of Sir
Francis Varney which lay upon its face in the faint moonlight which
each moment was gathering strength and power

He lies upon his face said Marchdale Will you go and turn him
over Who I God forbid I should touch him

Well well I will Come on

They halted within a couple of yards of the body Tom Eccles would not
go a step farther so Marchdale advanced alone and pretended to be
with great repugnance examining for the wound

He is quite dead he said but I cannot see the hurt I think he
turned his head as I fired

Did he Let us see

Marchdale lifted up the head and disclosed such a mass of
clotted-looking blood that Tom Eccles at once took to his heels nor
stopped until he was nearly as far off as the ruins Marchdale followed
him more slowly and when he came up to him he said 

The slugs have taken effect on his face I know it I know it Don't
tell me

He looks horrible And I am a murderer

Psha You look upon this matter too seriously Think of who and what he
was and then you will soon acquit yourself of being open to any such
charge I am bewildered Mr Marchdale and cannot now know whether
he be a vampire or not If he be not I have murdered most
unjustifiably a fellow-creature

Well but if he be Why even then I do not know but that I ought to
consider myself as guilty He is one of God's creatures if he were ten
times a vampire

Well you really do take a serious view of the affair Not more
serious than it deserves

And what do you mean to do I shall remain here to await the result
of what you tell me will ensue if he be a real vampire Even now the
moonbeams are full upon him and each moment increasing in intensity
Think you he will recover

I do indeed Then here will I wait

Since that is you resolve I will keep you company We shall easily
find some old stone in the ruins which will serve us for a seat and
there at leisure we can keep our eyes upon the dead body and be able to
observe if it make the least movement

This plan was adopted and they sat down just within the ruins but in
such a place that they had a full view of the dead body as it appeared
to be of Sir Francis Varney upon which the sweet moonbeams shone full
and clear

Tom Eccles related how he was incited to come upon his expedition but
he might have spared himself that trouble as Marchdale had been in a
retired corner of the inn parlour before he came to his appointment with
Varney and heard the business for the most part proposed

Half-an-hour certainly not more might have elapsed when suddenly Tom
Eccles uttered an exclamation partly of surprise and partly of
terror 

He moves he moves he cried Look at the vampire's body

Marchdale affected to look with an all-absorbing interest and there was
Sir Francis Varney raising slowly one arm with the hand outstretched
towards the moon as if invoking that luminary to shed more of its beams
upon him Then the body moved slowly like some one writhing in pain
and yet unable to move from the spot on which it lay From the head to
the foot the whole frame seemed to be convulsed and now and then as
the ghastly object seemed to be gathering more strength the limbs were
thrown out with a rapid and a frightful looking violence

It was truly to one who might look upon it as a reality and no juggle
a frightful sight to see and although Marchdale of course tolerably
well preserved his equanimity only now and then for appearance sake
affecting to be wonderfully shocked poor Tom Eccles was in such a state
of horror and fright that he could not if he would have flown from the
spot so fascinated was he by the horrible spectacle

This was a state of things which continued for many minutes and then
the body showed evident symptoms of so much returning animation that it
was about to rise from his gory bed and mingle once again with the
living

Behold said Marchdale behold Heaven have mercy upon us

It is as I said the beams of the moon have revived the vampire You
perceive now that there can be no doubt Yes yes I see him I see
him

Sir Francis Varney now as if with a great struggle rose to his feet
and looked up at the bright moon for some moments with such an air and
manner that it would not have required any very great amount of
imagination to conceive that he was returning to it some sort of
thanksgiving for the good that it had done to him

He then seemed for some moments in a state of considerable indecision as
to which way he should proceed He turned round several times Then he
advanced a step or two towards the house but apparently his resolution
changed again and casting his eyes upon the ruins he at once made
towards them

This was too much for the philosophy as well as for the courage of Tom
Eccles It was all very well to look on at some distance and observe
the wonderful and inexplicable proceedings of the vampire but when he
showed symptoms of making a nearer acquaintance it was not to be borne

Why he's coming here said Tom He seems so indeed remarked
Marchdale

Do you mean to stay I think I shall

You do do you Yes I should much like to question him and as we
are two to one I think we really can have nothing to fear

Do you I'm altogether of a different opinion A man who has more lives
than a cat don't much mind at what odds he fights You may stay if you
like You do not mean to say that you will desert me

I don't see a bit how you call it deserting you if we had come out
together on this adventure I would have stayed it out with you but as
we came separate and independent we may as well go back so Well
but 

Good morning cried Tom and he at once took to his heels towards the
town without staying to pay any attention to the remonstrances of
Marchdale who called after him in vain

Sir Francis Varney probably had Tom Eccles not gone off so rapidly
would have yet taken another thought and gone in another direction than
that which led him to the ruins and Tom if he had had his senses fully
about him as well as all his powers of perception would have seen that
the progress of the vampire was very slow while he continued to
converse with Marchdale and that it was only when he went off at good
speed that Sir Francis Varney likewise thought it prudent to do so

Is he much terrified said Varney as he came up to Marchdale Yes
most completely

This then will make a good story in the town It will indeed and
not a little enhance your reputation

Well well it don't much matter now but if by terrifying people I can
purchase for myself anything like immunity for the past I shall be
satisfied I think you may now safely reckon that you have done so
This man who has fled with so much precipitation had courage

Unquestionably Or else he would have shrunk from coming here at
all

True but his courage and presence arose from his strong doubts as to
the existence of such beings as vampires Yes and now that he is
convinced his bravery has evaporated along with his doubts and such a
tale as he has now to tell will be found sufficient to convert even the
most sceptical in the town

I hope so And yet it cannot much avail you

Not personally but I must confess that I am not dead to all human
opinions and I feel some desire of revenge against those dastards who
by hundreds have hunted me burnt down my mansion and sought my
destruction That I do not wonder at

I would fain leave among them a legacy of fear Such fear as shall
haunt them and their children for years to come I would wish that the
name of Varney the vampire should be a sound of terror for
generations It will be so

It shall And now then for a consideration of what is to be done
with our prisoner What is your resolve upon that point

I have considered it while I was lying upon yon green sward waiting for
the friendly moonbeams to fall upon my face and it seems to me that
there is no sort of resource but to   Kill him

No no What then

To set him free Nay have you considered the immense hazard of
doing so Think again I pray you think again I am decidedly of opinion
that he more than suspects who are his enemies and in that case you
know what consequences would ensue besides have we not enough already
to encounter Why should we add another young bold determined spirit
to the band which is already arrayed against us

You talk in vain Marchdale I know to what it all tends you have a
strong desire for the death of this young man No there you wrong
me I have no desire for his death for its own sake but where great
interests are at stake there must be sacrifices made

So there must therefore I will make a sacrifice and let this young
prisoner free from his dungeon If such be your determination I know
well it is useless to combat with it When do you purpose giving him his
freedom

I will not act so heedlessly as that your principles of caution shall
blame me I will attempt to get from him some promise that he will not
make himself an active instrument against me Perchance too as
Bannerworth Hall which he is sure to visit wears such an air of
desertion I may be able to persuade him that the Bannerworth family as
well as his uncle have left this part of the country altogether so
that without making any inquiry for them about the neighbourhood he
may be induced to leave at once That would be well

Good your prudence approves of the plan and therefore it shall be
done I am rather inclined to think said Marchdale with a slight
tone of sarcasm that if my prudence did not approve of the plan it
would still be done

Most probably said Varney calmly Will you release him to-night

It is morning now and soon the soft grey light of day will tint the
east I do not think I will release him till sunset again now Has he
provision to last him until then He has

Well then two hours after sunset I will come here and release him
from his weary bondage and now I must go to find some place in which to
hide my proscribed head As for Bannerworth Hall I will yet have it in
my power I have sworn to do so I will keep my oath The
accomplishment of our purpose I regret to say seems as far off as
ever

Not so not so As I before remarked we must disappear for a time so
as to lull suspicion There will then arise a period when Bannerworth
Hall will neither be watched as it is now nor will it be inhabited a
period before the Bannerworth family has made up its mind to go back to
it and when long watching without a result has become too tiresome to
be continued at all then we can at once pursue our object Be it
so

And now Marchdale I want more money More money

Yes you know well that I have had large demands of late But I
certainly had an impression that you were possessed by the death of
some one with very ample means

Yes but there is a means by which all is taken from me I have no real
resources but what are rapidly used up so I must come upon you
again I have already completely crippled myself as regards money
matters in this enterprise and I do certainly hope that the fruits will
not be far distant If they be much longer delayed I shall really not
know what to do However come to the lodge where you have been staying
and then I will give you to the extent of my ability whatever sum you
think your present exigencies require

Come on then at once I would certainly of course rather leave this
place now before daybreak Come on I say come on

Sir Francis Varney and Marchdale walked for some time in silence across
the meadows It was evident that there was not between these associates
the very best of feelings Marchdale was always smarting under an
assumption of authority over him on the part of Sir Francis Varney
while the latter scarcely cared to conceal any portion of the contempt
with which he regarded his hypocritical companion

Some very strong band of union indeed must surely bind these two
strange persons together It must be something of a more than common
nature which induces Marchdale not only to obey the behests of his
mysterious companion but to supply him so readily with money as we
perceive he promises to do

And as regards Varney the vampire he too must have some great
object in view to induce him to run such a world of risk and take so
much trouble as he was doing with the Bannerworth family

What his object is and what is the object of Marchdale will now that
we have progressed so far in our story soon appear and then much that
is perfectly inexplicable will become clear and distinct and we shall
find that some strong human motives are at the bottom of it all




 LXV

VARNEY'S VISIT TO THE DUNGEON OF THE LONELY PRISONER IN THE RUINS


Illustration

Evident it was that Marchdale was not near so scrupulous as Sir Francis
Varney in what he chose to do He would without hesitation have
sacrificed the life of that prisoner in the lonely dungeon whom it
would be an insult to the understanding of our readers not to presume
that they had long ere this established in their minds to be Charles
Holland

His own safety seemed to be the paramount consideration with Marchdale
and it was evident that he cared for nothing in comparison with that
object

It says much however for Sir Francis Varney that he did not give in
to such a blood-thirsty feeling but rather chose to set the prisoner
free and run all the chances of the danger to which he might expose
himself by such a course of conduct than to insure safety
comparatively by his destruction

Sir Francis Varney is evidently a character of strangely mixed feelings
It is quite evident that he has some great object in view which he
wishes to accomplish almost at any risk but it is equally evident at
the same time that he wishes to do so with the least possible injury to
others or else he would never have behaved as he had done in his
interview with the beautiful and persecuted Flora Bannerworth or now
suggested the idea of setting Charles Holland free from the dreary
dungeon in which he had been so long confined

We are always anxious and willing to give every one credit for the good
that is in them and hence we are pleased to find that Sir Francis
Varney despite his singular and apparently preternatural capabilities
has something sufficiently human about his mind and feelings to induce
him to do as little injury as possible to others in the pursuit of his
own objects

Of the two vampire as he is we prefer him much to the despicable and
hypocritical Marchdale who under the pretence of being the friend of
the Bannerworth family would freely have inflicted upon them the most
deadly injuries

It was quite clear that he was most dreadfully disappointed that Sir
Francis Varney would not permit him to take the life of Charles
Holland and it was with a gloomy and dissatisfied air that he left the
ruins to proceed towards the town after what we may almost term the
altercation he had had with Varney the vampire upon that subject

It must not be supposed that Sir Francis Varney however was blind to
the danger which must inevitably accrue from permitting Charles Holland
once more to obtain his liberty

What the latter would be able to state would be more than sufficient to
convince the Bannerworths and all interested in their fortunes that
something was going on of a character which however supernatural it
might seem to be still seemed to have some human and ordinary objects
for its ends

Sir Francis Varney thought over all this before he proceeded according
to his promise to the dungeon of the prisoner but it would seem as if
there was considerable difficulty even to an individual of his long
practice in all kinds of chicanery and deceit in arriving at any
satisfactory conclusion as to a means of making Charles Holland's
release a matter of less danger to himself than it would be likely to
be if unfettered by obligation he was at once set free

At the solemn hour of midnight while all was still that is to say on
the night succeeding the one on which he had had the interview with
Marchdale we have recorded Sir Francis Varney alone sought the silent
ruins He was attired as usual in his huge cloak and indeed the
chilly air of the evening warranted such protection against its numerous
discomforts

Had any one seen him however that evening they would have observed an
air of great doubt and irresolution upon his brow as if he were
struggling with some impulses which he found it extremely difficult to
restrain

I know well he muttered as he walked among the shadow of the ruins
that Marchdale's reasoning is coldly and horribly correct when he says
that there is danger in setting this youth free but I am about to
leave this place and not to show myself for some time and I cannot
reconcile myself to inflicting upon him the horror of a death by
starvation which must ensue

It was a night of more than usual dullness and as Sir Francis Varney
removed the massy stone which hid the narrow and tortuous entrance to
the dungeons a chilly feeling crept over him and he could not help
supposing that even then Marchdale might have played him false and
neglected to supply the prisoner food according to his promise

Hastily he descended to the dungeons and with a step which had in it
far less of caution than had usually characterised his proceedings he
proceeded onwards until he reached that particular dungeon in which our
young friend to whom we wished so well had been so long confined from
the beautiful and cheering light of day and from all that his heart's
best affections most cling to

Speak said Sir Francis Varney as he entered the dungeon If the
occupant of this dreary place live let him answer one who is as much
his friend as he has been his enemy

I have no friend said Charles Holland faintly unless it be one who
would come and restore me to liberty

And how know you that I am not he

Your voice sounds like that of one of my persecutors Why do you not
place the climax to your injuries by at once taking away life I should
be better pleased that you would do so than that I should wear out the
useless struggle of existence in so dreary and wretched an abode as
this

Young man said Sir Francis Varney I have come to you on a greater
errand of mercy than probably you will ever give me credit for There
is one who would too readily have granted your present request and who
would at once have taken that life of which you profess to be so
wearied but which may yet present to you some of its sunniest and most
beautiful aspects

Your tones are friendly said Charles but yet I dread some new
deception That you are one of those who consigned me by stratagem and
by brute force to this place of durance I am perfectly well assured
and therefore any good that may be promised by you presents itself to
me in a very doubtful character

I cannot be surprised said Sir Francis Varney at such sentiments
arising from your lips but nevertheless I am inclined to save you
You have been detained here because it was supposed by being so a
particular object would be best obtained by your absence That object
however has failed notwithstanding and I do not feel further inclined
to protract your sufferings Have you any guess as to the parties who
have thus confined you I am unaccustomed to dissemble and
therefore I will say at once that I have a guess

In which way does it tend 

Against Sir Francis Varney called the vampire

Does it not strike you that this may be a dangerous candour It may
or it may not be I cannot help it I know I am at the mercy of my foes
and I do not believe that anything I can say or do will make my
situation worse or better

You are much mistaken there In other hands than mine it might make it
much worse but it happens to be one of my weaknesses that I am charged
with candour and that I admire boldness of disposition Indeed and
yet can behave in the manner you have done towards me

Yes There are more things in heaven and on earth than are dreamt of in
your philosophy I am the more encouraged to set you free because if I
procure from you a promise which I intend to attempt I am inclined to
believe that you will keep it I shall assuredly keep whatever
promise I may make Propound your conditions and if they be such as
honour and honesty will permit me to accede to I will do so willingly
and at once Heaven knows I am weary enough of this miserable
imprisonment

Will you promise me then if I set you free not to mention your
suspicions that it is to Sir Francis Varney you owe this ill turn and
not to attempt any act of vengeance against him as a retaliation for
it I cannot promise so much as that Freedom indeed would be a
poor boon if I were not permitted freely to converse of some of the
circumstances connected with my captivity

You object I do to the former of your propositions but not to the
latter I will promise not to go at all out of my way to execute any
vengeance upon you but I will not promise that I will not communicate
the circumstances of my forced absence from them to those friends whose
opinion I so much value and to return to whom is almost as dear to me
as liberty itself

Sir Francis Varney was silent for a few moments and then he said in a
tone of deep solemnity 

There are ninety-nine persons out of a hundred who would take your life
for the independence of your tongue but I am as the hundredth one who
looks with a benevolent eye at your proceedings Will you promise me if
I remove the fetters which now bind your limbs that you will make no
personal attack upon me for I am weary of personal contention and I
have no disposition to endure it Will you make me this promise I
promise I will

Without another word but trusting implicitly to the promise which had
been given to him Sir Francis Varney produced a small key from his
pocket and unlocked with it a padlock which confined the chains about
the prisoner

With ease Charles Holland was then enabled to shake them off and then
for the first time for some weeks he rose to his feet and felt all
the exquisite relief of being comparatively free from bondage

This is delightful indeed he said

It is said Sir Francis Varney it is but a foretaste of the
happiness you will enjoy when you are entirely free You see that I have
trusted you

You have trusted me as you might trust me and you perceive that I have
kept my word

You have and since you decline to make me the promise which I would
fain have from you to the effect that you would not mention me as one
of the authors of your calamity I must trust to your honour not to
attempt revenge for what you have suffered

That I will promise There can be but little difficulty to any generous
mind in giving up such a feeling In consequence of your sparing me what
you might still further have inflicted I will let the past rest and as
if it had never happened really to me and speak of it to others but as
a circumstance which I wish not to revert to but prefer should be
buried in oblivion

It is well and now I have a request to make of you which perhaps
you will consider the hardest of all

Name it I feel myself bound to a considerable extent to comply with
whatever you may demand of me that is not contrary to honourable
principle

Then it is this that comparatively free as you are and in a
condition as you are to assert your own freedom you will not do so
hastily or for a considerable period in fact I wish and expect that
you should wait yet awhile until it shall suit me to say that it is my
pleasure that you shall be free

That is indeed a hard condition to man who feels as you yourself
remark that he can assert his freedom It is one which I have still a
hope you will not persevere in

Nay young man I think that I have treated you with generosity to
make you feel that I am not the worst of foes you could have had All I
require of you is that you should wait here for about an hour It is
now nearly one o'clock will you wait until you hear it strike two
before you actually make a movement to leave this place

Charles Holland hesitated for some moments and then he said 

Do not fancy that I am not one who appreciates the singular trust you
have reposed in me and however repugnant to me it may be to remain
here a voluntary prisoner I am inclined to do so if it be but to
convince you that the trust you have reposed in me is not in vain and
that I can behave with equal generosity to you as you can to me

Be it so said Sir Francis Varney I shall leave you with a full
reliance that you will keep your word and now farewell When you think
of me fancy me rather one unfortunate than criminal and tell yourself
that even Varney the vampire had some traits in his character which
although they might not raise your esteem at all events did not loudly
call for your reprobation

I shall do so Oh Flora Flora I shall look upon you once again
after believing and thinking that I had bidden you a long and last
adieu My own beautiful Flora it is joy indeed to think that I shall
look upon that face again which to my perception is full of all the
majesty of loveliness

Sir Francis Varney looked coldly on while Charles uttered this
enthusiastic speech

Remember he said till two o'clock and he walked towards the door
of the dungeon You will have no difficulty in finding your way out
from this place Doubtless you already perceive the entrance by which I
gained admission

Had I been free said Charles and had the use of my limbs I should
long ere this have worked my way to life and liberty

'Tis well Goodnight

Varney walked from the place and just closed the door behind him With
a slow and stately step he left the ruins and Charles Holland found
himself once more alone but in a much more enviable condition than for
many weeks he could have called his

FLORA BANNERWORTH'S APPARENT INCONSISTENCY THE ADMIRAL'S CIRCUMSTANCES
AND ADVICE MR CHILLINGWORTH'S MYSTERIOUS ABSENCE


Illustration

For a brief space let us return to Flora Bannerworth who had suffered
so much on account of her affections as well as on account of the
mysterious attack that had been made upon her by the reputed vampire

After leaving Bannerworth Hall for a short time she seemed to recover
her spirits but this was a state of things which did not last and only
showed how fallacious it was to expect that after the grievous things
that had happened she would rapidly recover her equanimity

It is said by learned physiologists that two bodily pains cannot
endure at the same space of time in the system and whether it be so or
not is a question concerning which it would be foreign to the nature of
our work to enter into anything like an elaborate disquisition

Certainly however so far as Flora Bannerworth was concerned she
seemed inclined to show that mentally the observation was a true one
for that now she became released from a continued dread of the visits
of the vampire her mind would with more painful interest than ever
recur to the melancholy condition probably of Charles Holland if he
were alive and to soul-harrowing reflections concerning him if he were
dead

She could not and she did not believe for one moment that his
desertion of her had been of a voluntary character She knew or fancied
she knew him by far too well for that and she more than once expressed
her opinion to the effect that she was perfectly convinced his
disappearance was a part and parcel of all that train of circumstances
which had so recently occurred and produced such a world of unhappiness
to her as well as to the whole of the Bannerworth family

If he had never loved me she said to her brother Henry he would
have been alive and well but he has fallen a victim to the truth of a
passion and to the constancy of an affection which to my dying day I
will believe in

Now that Mr Marchdale had left the place there was no one to dispute
this proposition with Flora for all as well as she were fully
inclined to think well of Charles Holland

It was on the very morning which preceded that evening when Sir Francis
Varney called upon Charles Holland in the manner we have related with
the gratifying news that upon certain conditions he might be released
that Flora Bannerworth when the admiral came to see them spoke to him
of Charles Holland saying 

Now sir that I am away from Bannerworth Hall I do not and cannot
feel satisfied for the thought that Charles may eventually come back
and seek us there still haunts me Fancy him sir doing so and seeing
the place completely deserted

Well there's something in that said the admiral but however he's
hardly such a goose if it were so to happen to give up the chase he'd
find us out somehow

You think he would sir or do you not think that despair would seize
upon him and that fancying we had all left the spot for ever he might
likewise do so so that we should lose him more effectually than we have
done at present

No hardly said the admiral he couldn't be such a goose as that
Why when I was of his age if I had secured the affections of a young
girl like you I'd have gone over all the world but I'd have found out
where she was and what I mean to say is if he's half such a goose as
you think him he deserves to lose you

Did you not tell me something sir of Mr Chillingworth talking of
taking possession of the Hall for a brief space of time

Why yes I did and I expect he is there now in fact I'm sure he's
there for he said he would be

No he ain't said Jack Pringle at that moment entering the room
you're wrong again as you always are somehow or other

What you vagabond are you here you mutinous rascal Ay ay sir
go on don't mind me I wonder what you'd do sir if you hadn't
somebody like me to go on talking about

Why you infernal rascal I wonder what you'd do if you had not an
indulgent commander who puts up even with real mutiny and says nothing
about it But where have you been Did you go as I directed you and
take some provisions to Bannerworth Hall

Yes I did but I brought them back again there's nobody there and
don't seem likely to be except a dead body

A dead body Whose body can that be Tom somebody for I'm d  d if
it ain't a great he cat

You scoundrel how dare you alarm me in such a way But do you mean to
tell me that you did not see Dr Chillingworth at the Hall How could
I see him if he wasn't there

But he was there he said he would be there Then he's gone again
for there's nobody there that I know of in the shape of a doctor I went
through every part of the ship I mean the house and the deuce a soul
could I find so as it was rather lonely and uncomfortable I came away
again Who knows thought I but some blessed vampire or another may
come across me'

This won't do said the old admiral buttoning up his coat to the
chin Bannerworth Hall must not be deserted in this way It is quite
clear that Sir Francis Varney and his associates have some particular
object in view in getting possession of the place Here you
Jack Ay ay sir

Illustration

Just go back again and stay at the Hall till somebody comes to you
Even such a stupid hound as you will be something to scare away
unwelcome visitors Go back to the Hall I say What are you staring
at Back to Bannerworth Hall said Jack What just where I've come
from all that way off and nothing to eat and what's worse nothing
to drink I'll see you d  d first

The admiral caught up a table-fork and made a rush at Jack but Henry
Bannerworth interfered

No no he said admiral no no not that You must recollect that
you yourself have given this no doubt faithful fellow of your's
liberty to do and say a great many things which don't look like good
service but I have no doubt from what I have seen of his disposition
that he would risk his life rather than that you should come to any
harm

Ay ay said Jack he quite forgets when the bullets were scuttling
our nobs off Cape Ushant when that big Frenchman had hold of him by the
skirf of his neck and began pummelling his head and the lee scuppers
were running with blood and a bit of Joe Wiggins's brains had come slap
in my eye while some of Jack Marling's guts was hanging round my neck
like a nosegay all in consequence of grape-shot then he didn't say as
I was a swab when I came up and bored a hole in the Frenchman's back
with a pike Ay it's all very well now when there's peace and no
danger to call Jack Pringle a lubberly rascal and mutinous I'm
blessed if it ain't enough to make an old pair of shoes faint away

Why you infernal scoundrel said the admiral nothing of the sort
ever happened and you know it Jack you're no seaman Werry good
said Jack then if I ain't no seaman you are what shore-going people
calls a jolly fat old humbug

Jack hold your tongue said Henry Bannerworth you carry these
things too far You know very well that your master esteems you and you
should not presume too much upon that fact My master said Jack
don't call him my master I never had a master and don't intend He's
my admiral if you like but an English sailor don't like a master

I tell you what it is Jack said the admiral you've got your good
qualities I admit Ay ay sir that's enough you may as well leave
off well while you can

But I'll just tell you what you resemble more than anything
else Chew me up what may that be sir

A French marine A what A French marine Good-bye I wouldn't say
another word to you if you was to pay me a dollar a piece Of all the
blessed insults rolled into one this here's the worstest You might
have called me a marine or you might have called me a Frenchman but to
make out that I'm both a marine and a Frenchman d me if it isn't
enough to make human nature stand on an end Now I've done with you

And a good job too said the admiral I wish I'd thought of it
before You're worse than a third day's ague or a hot and a cold fever
in the tropics Very good said Jack I only hope Providence will
have mercy upon you and keep an eye upon you when I'm gone otherwise
I wonder what will become of you It wasn't so when young Belinda who
you took off the island of Antiggy in the Ingies jumped overboard and
I went after her in a heavy swell Howsomdever never mind you shook
hands with me then and while a bushel of the briny was weeping out of
the corner of each of your blinkers you says says you 

Hold cried the admiral hold I know what I said Jack It's cut a
fathom deep in my memory Give us your fist Jack and and  Hold
yourself said Jack I know what you're going to say and I won't hear
you say it so there's an end of it Lor bless you I knows you I ain't
a going to leave you Don't be afraid I only works you up and works
you down again just to see if there's any of that old spirit in you
when we was aboard the Victory Don't you recollect admiral

Yes yes enough Jack Why let me see that was a matter of forty
years ago nearly when I was a youngster

There there Jack that'll do You bring the events of other years
fresh upon my memory Peace peace I have not forgotten but still to
hear what you know of them if recited would give the old man a
pang A pang said Jack I suppose that's some dictionary word for
a punch in the eye That would be mutiny with a vengeance so I'm off

Go go I'm a going and just to please you I'll go to the Hall so
you sha'n't say that you told me to do anything that I didn't

Away went Jack whistling an air that might have been popular when he
and the admiral were young and Henry Bannerworth could not but remark
that an appearance of great sadness came over the old man when Jack was
gone

I fear sir he said that heedless sailor has touched upon some
episode in your existence the wounds of which are still fresh enough to
give you pain It is so said the old admiral just look at me
now Do I look like the hero of a romantic love story

Not exactly I admit Well notwithstanding that Jack Pringle has
touched a chord that vibrates in my heart yet replied the admiral

Have you any objection to tell me of it None whatever and
perhaps by the time I have done the doctor may have found his way back
again or Jack may bring us some news of him So here goes for a short
but a true yarn




 LXVII

THE ADMIRAL'S STORY OF THE BEAUTIFUL BELINDA


Illustration

Just at this moment Flora Bannerworth stole into the room from whence
she had departed a short time since but when she saw that old Admiral
Bell was looking so exceedingly serious and apparently about to address
Henry upon some very important subject she would have retired but he
turned towards her and said 

My story my dear I've no objection to your hearing and like all
women folks a love story never comes amiss to you so you may as well
stay and hear it A love story said Flora you tell a love story
sir

Yes my dear and not only tell it but be the hero of it likewise
ain't you astonished I am indeed

Well you'll be more astonished then before I've done so just listen
As Jack Pringle says it was the matter of about somewhere forty years
ago that I was in command of the Victory frigate which was placed upon
the West Indian station during a war then raging for the protection of
our ports and harbours in that vicinity We'd not a strong force in that
quarter therefore I had to cut about from place to place and do the
best I could After a time though I rather think that we frightened
off the enemy during which time I chiefly anchored off the island of
Antigua and was hospitably received at the house of a planter of the
name of Marchant who in fact made his house my home and introduced
me to all the elite of the society of the island Ah Miss Flora
you've no idea to look at me now what I was then I held a captain's
commission and was nearly the youngest man in the service with such a
rank I was as slender ay as a dancing master These withered and
bleached locks were black as the raven's plume Ay ay but no matter
the planter had a daughter

And you loved her said Flora Loved her said the old man and the
flush of youthful animation come to his countenance loved her do you
say I adored her I worshipped her she was to me but what a d  d
old fool I am we'll skip that if you please

Nay nay said Flora that is what I want to hear I haven't the
least doubt of that in the world but that's just what you won't hear
none of your nonsense Miss Flora the old man may be a fool but he
isn't quite an idiot

He's neither said Flora true feelings can never disgrace any
one Perhaps not but however to make a long story short somehow
or other one day Belinda was sitting alone and I rudely pounced upon
her I rather think then I must have said something that I oughtn't to
have said for it took her so aback I was forced somehow or other to
hold her up and then I I yes I'm sure I kissed her and so I told
her I loved her and then what do you think she said

Why said Flora that she reciprocated the passion D n my rags
said Jack who at the moment came into the room I suppose that's the
name of some shell or other

You here you villain said the admiral I thought you were
gone So I was said Jack but I came back for my hat you see

Away he went again and the admiral resumed his story

Well Miss Flora he said you haven't made a good guess as she
didn't say anything at all she only clung to me like some wild bird to
its mother's breast and cried as if her heart would break Indeed

Yes I didn't know the cause of her emotion but at last I got it out
of her What was it

Oh a mere trifle she was already married to somebody else that's
all some d  d fellow who had gone trading about the islands a
fellow she didn't care a straw about that was old enough to be her
father

And you left her No I didn't Guess again I was a mad-headed
youngster I only felt I didn't think I persuaded her to come away
with me I took her aboard my ship and set sail with her A few weeks
flew like hours but one day we were hailed by a vessel and when we
neared her she manned a boat and brought a letter on board addressed
to Belinda It was from her father written in his last moments It
began with a curse and ended with a blessing There was a postscript in
another hand to say the old man died of grief She read it by my side
on the quarter-deck It dropped from her grasp and she plunged into the
sea Jack Pringle went after her but I never saw her again

Gracious Heavens what a tragedy Yes tolerable said the old man

He arose and took his hat and placed it on his head He gave the crown
of it a blow that sent it nearly over his eyes He thrust his hands deep
into his breeches pockets clenched his teeth and muttered something
inaudible as he strode from the apartment

Who would have thought Henry said Flora that such a man as Admiral
Bell had been the hero of such an adventure Ay who indeed but it
shows that we never can judge from appearances Flora and that those
who seem to us the most heart-whole may have experienced the wildest
vicissitudes of passion

And we must remember likewise that this was forty years ago Henry
which makes a material difference in the state of the case as regards
Admiral Bell

It does indeed more than half a lifetime and yet how evident it was
that his old feelings clung to him I can well imagine the many hours of
bitter regret which the memory of this his lost love must have given
him

True true I can feel something for him for have I not lost one who
loved me a worse loss too than that which Admiral Bell relates for
am I not a prey to all the horrors of uncertainty Whereas he knew the
worst and that at all events death had claimed its victim leaving
nothing to conjecture in the shape of suffering so that the mind had
nothing to do but to recover slowly but surely as it would from the
shock which it had received

That is worse than you Flora but rather would I have you cherish hope
of soon beholding Charles Holland probably alive and well than fancy
any great disaster has come over him

I will endeavour to do so replied Flora

I long to hear what has become of Dr Chillingworth His disappearance
is most singular for I fully suspected that he had some particular
object in view in getting possession for a short time of Bannerworth
Hall but now from Jack Pringle's account he appears not to be in it
and in fact to have disappeared completely from the sight of all who
knew him

Yes said Flora but he may have done that brother still in
furtherance of his object

It may be so and I will hope that it is so Keep yourself close
sister and see no one while I proceed to his house to inquire if they
have heard anything of him I will return soon be assured and in the
meantime should you see my brother tell him I shall be at home in an
hour or so and not to leave the cottage for it is more than likely
that the admiral has gone to Bannerworth Hall so that you may not see
anything of him for some time

MARCHDALE'S ATTEMPTED VILLANY AND THE RESULT


Illustration

Varney the vampire left the dungeon of Charles Holland amid the grey
ruins with a perfect confidence the young man would keep his word and
not attempt to escape from that place until the time had elapsed which
he had dictated to him

And well might he have that confidence for having once given his word
that he would remain until he heard the clock strike two from a
neighbouring church Charles Holland never dreamt for a moment of
breaking it

To be sure it was a weary time to wait when liberty appeared before him
but he was the soul of honour and the least likely man in all the world
to infringe in the slightest upon the condition which he had of his own
free will acceded to

Sir Francis Varney walked rapidly until he came nearly to the outskirts
of the town and then he slackened his pace proceeding more cautiously
and looking carefully about him as if he feared to meet any one who
might recognise him

He had not proceeded far in this manner when he became conscious of the
cautious figure of a man gliding along in the opposite direction to that
which he was taking

A suspicion struck him from the general appearance that it was
Marchdale and if so he wondered to see him abroad at such a time Still
he would not be quite certain but he hurried forward so as to meet the
advancing figure and then his suspicions were confirmed and Marchdale
with some confusion in his looks and manners accosted him

Ah Sir Francis Varney he said you are out late 

Why you know I should be out late said Varney and you likewise
know the errand upon which I was to be out

Oh I recollect you were to release your prisoner 

Yes I was

And have you done so 

Oh no

Oh indeed I I am glad you have taken better thoughts of it Good
night good night we shall meet to-morrow 

Adieu said Sir Francis Varney and he watched the retreating figure
of Marchdale and then he added in a low tone to himself 

I know his object well His craven spirit shrinks at the notion a
probable enough one I will admit that Charles Holland has recognised
him and that if once free he would denounce him to the Bannerworths
holding him up to scorn in his true colours and bringing down upon his
head perhaps something more than detestation and contempt The
villain he is going now to take the life of the man whom he considers
chained to the ground Well well they must fight it out together
Charles Holland is sufficiently free to take his own part although
Marchdale little thinks that such is the case

Marchdale walked on for some little distance and then he turned and
looked after Sir Francis Varney

Indeed he said so you have not released him to-night but I know
well will do so soon I do not for my part admire this romantic
generosity which sets a fox free at the moment that he's the most
dangerous It's all very well to be generous but it is better to be
just first and that I consider means looking after one's self first I
have a poniard here which will soon put an end to the troubles of the
prisoner in his dungeon its edge is keen and sharp and will readily
find a way to his heart

He walked on quite exultingly and carelessly now for he had got into
the open country and it was extremely unlikely that he would meet
anybody on his road to the ruins

It did not take many minutes sharp walking now to bring him close to
the spot which he intended should become such a scene of treacherous
slaughter and just then he heard from afar off something like the
muttering of thunder as if Heaven itself was proclaiming its vengeance
against the man who had come out to slay one of its best and noblest
creatures

What is that said Marchdale shrinking back a moment what is
that an approaching storm It must be so for now I recollect me the
sun set behind a bank of clouds of a fiery redness and as the evening
drew in there was every appearance in the heavens of some ensuing strife
of the elements

He listened for a few moments and fixed his eyes intently in the
direction of the horizon from where the muttering sounds had proceeded

He had not long to wait before he saw a bright flash of blue lightning
which for one instant illumined the sky then by the time he could have
counted twelve there came the thunder which the flash preceded and he
felt terribly anxious to complete his enterprize so that he might get
back to the town and be safely housed before the storm which was
evidently approaching should burst upon him

It is sweeping on apace he said why did I not come earlier

Even as he spoke he plunged among the recesses of the ruins and
searching about for the old stone which covered the entrance to the
dungeon he was surprised to find it rolled from its place and the
aperture open

What is the meaning of this he said how negligent of Sir Francis
Varney or perhaps after all he was only jesting with me and let the
prisoner go If that should be the case I am foiled indeed but surely
he could not be so full of indiscretion

Again came a dazzling flash of lightning which now surrounded by the
ruins as he was made him shrink back and cover his eyes for a moment
and then followed a peal of thunder with not half the duration of time
between it and the flash which had characterized the previous electric
phenomenon

The storm approaches fast said Marchdale I must get my work done
quickly if indeed my victim be here which I begin seriously to doubt

He descended the intricate winding passage to the vault below which
served the purpose of a dungeon and when he got very nearly into the
depth of its recesses he called aloud saying 

Ho what ho is there any one here Yes said Charles Holland who
fancied it might be his former visitor returned Have you come to
repent of your purpose

Ah said Marchdale to himself Sir Francis after all has told me
the truth the prisoner is still here

The light from without was not near sufficient to send the least ray
into the depths of that dungeon so that Marchdale when he entered the
place could see nothing but an absolute blackness

It was not so however with Charles Holland whose eyes had been now so
long accustomed to the place that he could see in it as if a dim
twilight irradiated it and he at once in his visitor saw his worst
foe and not the man who had comparatively set him free

He saw too that the hand of his visitor grasped a weapon which
Marchdale thought that favoured by the darkness he might carry openly
in perfect security

Where are you said Marchdale I cannot see you Here said
Charles you may feel my grip and he sprung upon him in an instant

The attack was so sudden and so utterly unexpected that Marchdale was
thrown backwards and the dagger wrested from his grasp during the
first impulse which Charles Holland had thrown into his attack

Moreover his head struck with such violence against the earthern floor
that it produced a temporary confusion of his faculties so that had
Charles Holland been so inclined he might with Marchdale's own weapon
have easily taken his life

The young man did on the impulse of the moment raise it in his hand
but on the impulse of another thought he cast it from him
exclaiming 

No no not that I should be as bad as he or nearly so This villain
has come to murder me but yet I will not take his life for the deed
What shall I do with him Ha a lucky thought chains

He dragged Marchdale to the identical spot of earth on which he had lain
so long and as Sir Francis Varney had left the key of the padlock
which bound the chains together in it he in a few moments had
succeeded in placing the villain Marchdale in the same durance from
which he had himself shortly since escaped

Remain there he said until some one comes to rescue you I will not
let you starve to death but I will give you a long fast and when I
come again it shall be along with some of the Bannerworth family to
show them what a viper they have fostered in their hearts

Marchdale was just sufficiently conscious now to feel all the realities
of his situation In vain he attempted to rise from his prostrate
position The chains did their duty keeping down a villain with the
same means that they had held in ignominious confinement a true man

He was in a perfect agony inasmuch as he considered that he would be
allowed to remain there to starve to death thus achieving for himself a
more horrible death than any he had ever thought of inflicting

Villain exclaimed Charles Holland you shall there remain and let
you have what mental sufferings you may you richly deserve them

He heeded not the cries of Marchdale he heeded not his imprecations any
more than he did his prayers and the arch hypocrite used both in
abundance Charles was but too happy once more to look upon the open
sky although it was then in darkness to heed anything that Marchdale
in the agony to which he was now reduced might feel inclined to say
and after glancing around him for some few moments when he was free of
the ruins and inhaling with exquisite delight the free air of the
surrounding meadows he saw by the twinkling of the lights in which
direction the town lay and knowing that by taking a line in that path
and then after a time diverging a little to the right he should come to
Bannerworth Hall he walked on never in his whole life probably feeling
such an enjoyment of the mere fact of existence as at such a moment as
that of exquisite liberty

Our readers may with us imagine what it is to taste the free fresh air
of heaven after being long pent up as he Charles Holland had been
in a damp noisome dungeon teeming with unwholesome exhalations They
may well suppose with what an amount of rapture he now found himself
unrestrained in his movements by those galling fetters which had hung
for so long a period upon his youthful limbs and which not
unfrequently in the despair of his heart he had thought he should
surely die in

And last although not least in his dear esteem did the rapturous
thought of once more looking in the sweet face of her he loved come
cross him with a gush of delight

Yes he exclaimed as he quickened his pace yes I shall be able to
tell Flora Bannerworth how well and how truly I love her I shall be
able to tell her that in my weary and hideous imprisonment the thought
alone of her has supported me

As he neared the Hall he quickened his pace to such an extent that
soon he was forced to pause altogether as the exertion he had
undertaken pretty plainly told him that the imprisonment scanty diet
and want of exercise which had been his portion for some time past had
most materially decreased his strength

His limbs trembled and a profuse perspiration bedewed his brow
although the night was rather cold than otherwise

I am very weak he said and much I wonder now that I succeeded in
overcoming that villain Marchdale who if I had not done so would most
assuredly have murdered me

And it was a wonder for Marchdale was not an old man although he might
be considered certainly as past the prime of life and he was of a
strong and athletic build But it was the suddenness of his attack upon
him which had given Charles Holland the great advantage and had caused
the defeat of the ruffian who came bent on one of the most cowardly and
dastardly murders that could be committed namely upon an unoffending
man whom he supposed to be loaded with chains and incapable of making
the least efficient resistance

Charles soon again recovered sufficient breath and strength to proceed
towards the Hall and now warned by the exhaustion which had come over
him that he had not really anything like strength enough to allow him to
proceed rapidly he walked with slow and deliberate steps

This mode of proceeding was more favourable to reflection than the wild
rapid one which he had at first adopted and in all the glowing colours
of youthful and ingenious fancy did he depict to himself the surprise
and the pleasure that would beam in the countenance of his beloved Flora
when she should find him once again by her side

Of course he Charles could know nothing of the contrivances which had
been resorted to and which the reader may lay wholly to the charge of
Marchdale to blacken his character and to make him appear faithless to
the love he had professed

Had he known this it is probable that indignation would have added
wings to his progress and he would not have been able to proceed at the
leisurely pace he felt that his state of physical weakness dictated to
him

And now he saw the topmost portion at Bannerworth Hall pushing out from
amongst the trees with which the ancient pile was so much surrounded
and the sight of the home of his beloved revived him and quickened the
circulation of the warm blood in his veins

I shall behold her now he said I shall behold her how A few
minutes more and I shall hold her to my heart that heart which has
been ever hers and which carried her image enshrined in its deepest
recesses even into the gloom of a dungeon

But let us while Charles Holland is indulging in these delightful
anticipations anticipations which we regret in consequence of the
departure of the Bannerworths from the Hall will not be realized so
soon as he supposes look back upon the discomfited hypocrite and
villain Marchdale who occupies his place in the dungeon of the old
ruins

Until Charles Holland actually had left the strange horrible and
cell-like place he could scarcely make up his mind that the young man
entertained a serious intention of leaving him there

Perhaps he did not think any one could be so cruel and so wicked as he
himself for the reader will no doubt recollect that his Marchdale's
counsel to Varney was to leave Charles Holland to his fate chained
down as he was in the dungeon and that fate would have been the
horrible one of being starved to death in the course of a few days

When now however he felt confident that he was deserted when he heard
the sound of Charles Holland's retreating footsteps slowly dying away in
the distance until not the faintest echo of them reached his ears he
despaired indeed and the horror he experienced during the succeeding
ten minutes might be considered an ample atonement for some of his
crimes His brain was in a complete whirl nothing of a tangible nature
but that he was there chained down and left to starve to death came
across his intellect Then a kind of madness for a moment or two took
possession of him he made a tremendous effort to burst asunder the
bands that held him

But it was in vain The chains which had been placed upon Charles
Holland during the first few days of his confinement when he had a
little recovered from the effects of the violence which had been
committed upon him at the time when he was captured effectually
resisted Marchdale

They even cut into his flesh inflicting upon him some grievous wounds
but that was all he achieved by his great efforts to free himself so
that after a few moments bleeding and in great pain he with a deep
groan desisted from the fruitless efforts he had better not have
commenced

Then he remained silent for a time but it was not the silence of
reflection it was that of exhaustion and as such was not likely to
last long nor did it for in the course of another five minutes he
called out loudly

Perhaps he thought there might be a remote chance that some one
traversing the meadows would hear him and yet if he had duly
considered the matter which he was not in a fitting frame of mind to
do he would have recollected that in choosing a dungeon among the
underground vaults of these ruins he had by experiment made certain
that no cry however loud from where he lay could reach the upper air
And thus had this villain by the very precautions which he had himself
taken to ensure the safe custody of another been his own greatest
enemy

Help help help he cried frantically Varney Charles Holland have
mercy upon me and do not leave me here to starve Help oh Heaven
Curses on all your heads curses Oh mercy mercy mercy

In suchlike incoherent expressions did he pass some hours until what
with exhaustion and a raging thirst that came over him he could not
utter another word but lay the very picture of despair and discomfited
malice and wickedness




 LXIX

FLORA BANNERWORTH AND HER MOTHER THE EPISODE OF CHIVALRY


Illustration

Gladly we turn from such a man as Marchdale to a consideration of the
beautiful and accomplished Flora Bannerworth to whom we may without
destroying in any way the interest of our plot predict a much happier
destiny than probably at that time she considers as at all likely to
be hers

She certainly enjoyed upon her first removal from Bannerworth Hall
greater serenity of mind than she had done there but as we have
already remarked of her the more her mind was withdrawn by change of
scene from the horrible considerations which the attack of the vampire
had forced upon her the more she reverted to the fate of Charles
Holland which was still shrouded in so much gloom

She would sit and converse with her mother upon that subject until she
worked up her feelings to a most uncomfortable pitch of excitement and
then Mrs Bannerworth would get her younger brother to join them who
would occasionally read to her some compositions of his own or of some
favourite writer whom he thought would amuse her

Illustration

It was on the very evening when Sir Francis Varney had made up his mind
to release Charles Holland that young Bannerworth read to his sister
and his mother the following little chivalric incident which he told
them he had himself collated from authentic sources 

The knight with the green shield exclaimed one of a party of
men-at-arms who were drinking together at an ancient hostel not far
from Shrewsbury the knight with the green shield is as good a knight
as ever buckled on a sword or wore spurs Then how comes it he is
not one of the victors in the day's tournament exclaimed another By
the bones of Alfred said a third a man must be judged of by his
deserts and not by the partiality of his friends That's my opinion
friends And mine too said another

That is all very true and my opinion would go with yours too but not
in this instance Though you may accuse me of partiality yet I am not
so for I have seen some of the victors of to-day by no means forward in
the press of battle-men who I will not say feared danger but who liked
it not so well but they avoided it as much as possible

Ay marry and so have I The reason is tis much easier to face a
blunted lance than one with a spear-head and a man may practise the
one and thrive in it but not the other for the best lance in the
tournament is not always the best arm in the battle

And that is the reason of my saying the knight with the green shield
was a good knight I have seen him in the midst of the melee when men
and horses have been hurled to the ground by the shock there he has
behaved himself like a brave knight and has more than once been noticed
for it

But how canne he to be so easily overthrown to-day That speaks
something His horse is an old one

So much the better said another he's used to his work and as
cunning as an old man But he has been wounded more than once and is
weakened very much besides I saw him lose his footing else he had
overthrown his opponent

He did not seem distressed about his accident at all events but sat
contented in the tent He knows well that those who know him will
never attribute his misadventure either to want of courage or conduct
moreover he seems to be one of those who care but little for the
opinion of men who care nothing for him

And he's right Well dear comrades the health of Green Knight or the
Knight with a Green Shield for that's his name or the designation he
chooses to go by A health to the Knight with the Green Shield
shouted the men-at-arms as they lifted their cups on high

Who is he inquired one of the men-at-arms of him who had spoken
favourably of the stranger I don't know

And yet you spoke favourably of him a few seconds back and said what a
brave knight he was And so I uphold him to be but I tell you what
friend I would do as much for the greatest stranger I ever met I have
seen him fight where men and horses have bit the dust in hundreds and
that in my opinion speaks out for the man and warrior he who cannot
then fight like a soldier had better tilt at home in the castle-yard
and there win ladies smiles but not the commendation of the leader of
the battle

That's true I myself recollect very well Sir Hugh de Colbert a very
accomplished knight in the castle-yard but his men were as fine a set
of fellows as ever crossed a horse to look at but they proved
deficient at the moment of trial they were broken and fled in a
moment and scarce one of them received a scratch

Then they hadn't stood the shock of the foeman No that's certain

But still I should like to know the knight to know his name very
well I know it not he has some reason for keeping it secret I
suppose but his deeds will not shame it be it what it may I can bear
witness to more than one foeman falling beneath his battle-axe

Indeed Yes and he took a banner from the enemy in the last battle
that was fought

Ah well he deserves a better fortune to-morrow Who is to be the
bridegroom of the beautiful Bertha daughter of Lord de Cauci That
will have to be decided but it is presumed that Sir Guthrie de Beaumont
is the intended

Ah but should he not prove the victor It's understood because
it's known he is intended by the parents of the lady and none would be
ungallant enough to prevail against him save on such conditions as
would not endanger the fruits of victory

No Certainly not they would lay the trophies at the foot of the
beauty worshipped by the knights at the tournament

So triumphant or not he's to be the bridegroom bearing off the prize
of valour whether or no in fact deserve her or not that's the
fact So it is so it is

And a shame too friends but so it is now but yet if the knight's
horse recovers from the strain and is fit for work to-morrow it
strikes me that the Green Shield will give some work to the holiday
knight

                                   

There had been a grand tournament held near Shrewsbury Castle in honour
of the intended nuptials of the beautiful Lady Bertha de Cauci She was
the only daughter of the Earl de Cauci a nobleman of some note he was
one of an ancient and unblemished name and of great riches

The lady was beautiful but at the same time she was an unwilling
bride every one could see that but the bridegroom cared not for that
There was a sealed sorrow on her brow a sorrow that seemed sincere and
lasting but she spoke not of it to any one her lips were seldom
parted She loved another Yes she loved one who was far away fighting
in the wars of his country one who was not so rich in lands as her
present bridegroom

When he left her she remembered his promise it was to fight on till
he earned a fortune or name that should give him some right to claim
her hand even from her imperious father But alas he came not and
what could she do against the commands of one who would be obeyed Her
mother too was a proud haughty woman one whose sole anxiety was to
increase the grandeur and power of her house by such connections

Thus it was pressed on by circumstances she could no longer hold out
more especially as she heard nothing of her knight She knew not where
he was or indeed if he were living or dead She knew not he was never
named This last circumstance indeed gave her pain for it assured her
that he whom she loved had been unable to signalize himself from among
other men That in fact he was unknown in the annals of fame as well
as the probability that he had been slain in some of the earlier
skirmishes of the war This if it had happened caused her some pain to
think upon not but such events were looked upon with almost
indifference by females save in such cases where their affections were
engaged as on this occasion But the event was softened by the fact
that men were continually falling by the hand of man in such encounters
but at the same time it was considered an honourable and praiseworthy
death for a soldier He was wounded but not with the anguish we now
hear of for the friends were consoled by the reflection that the
deceased warrior died covered with glory

Bertha however was young and as yet she knew not the cause of her
absent knight's silence or why he had not been heard of among the most
forward in the battle

Heaven's will be done she exclaimed what can I do I must submit to
my father's behests but my future life will be one of misery and
sorrow

She wept to think of the past and to dream of the future both alike
were sorrowful to think upon no comfort in the past and no joy in the
future

Thus she wept and sorrowed on the night of the first tournament there
was to be a second and that was to be the grand one where her intended
bridegroom was to show himself off in her eyes and take his part in the
sport

                                   

Bertha sat late she sat sorrowing by the light of the lamps and the
flickering flame of the fire as it rose and fell on the hearth and
threw dancing shadows on the walls

Oh why Arthur Home should you thus be absent Absent too at such a
time when you are more needed than ever Alas alas you may no longer
be in the land of the living Your family is great and your name
known your own has been spoken with commendation from the lips of your
friend what more of fame do you need but I am speaking without
purpose Heaven have mercy on me

As she spoke she looked up and saw one of her women in waiting standing
by

Well what would you My lady there is one who would speak with
you said the hand-maiden

With me Yes my lady he named you the Lady Bertha de Cauci

Who and what is he she inquired with something like trepidation of
the maiden I know not my lady

But gave he not some token by which I might know who I admit to my
chamber None replied the maiden

And what does he bear by way of distinguishing himself What crest or
device doth he bear Merely a green shield

The unsuccessful knight in the tournament to-day Heaven's what can he
desire with me he is not no no it cannot be it cannot be Will
you admit him lady

Indeed I know not what to do but yet he may have some intelligence to
give me Yes yes admit him but first throw some logs on the fire

The attendant did as she was desired and then quitted the room for the
purpose of admitting the stranger knight with the green shield In a few
moments she could hear the stride of the knight as he entered the
apartment and she thought the step was familiar to her ear she thought
it was the step of Sir Arthur Home her lover She waited anxiously to
see the door open and then the stranger entered His form and bearing
was that of her lover but his visor was down and she was unable to
distinguish the features of the stranger

His armour was such as had seen many a day's hard wear and there were
plenty of marks of the battle about him His travel-worn accoutrements
were altogether such as bespoke service in the field

Sir you desired to see me say wherefore you do so and if it is news
you bring The knight answered not but pointed to the female
attendant as if he desired she would withdraw You may retire said
Bertha be within call and let me know if I am threatened with
interruption

The attendant retired and then the knight and lady were left alone The
former seemed at a loss how to break silence for some moments and then
he said 

Lady    Oh Heavens tis he exclaimed Bertha as she sprang to
her feet it is Sir Arthur Home

It is exclaimed the knight pulling up his visor and dropping on one
knee he encircled his arm round the waist of the lady and at the same
moment he pressed her lips to his own

The first emotion of joy and surprise over Bertha checked her
transports and chid the knight for his boldness

Nay chide me not dear Bertha I am what I was when I left you and
hope to find you the same

Am I not said Bertha Truly I know not for you seem more beautiful
than you were then I hope that is the only change

If there be a change it is only such as you see Sorrow and regret
form the principal causes I understand you

My intended nuptials    Yes I have heard all I came here but
late in the morning and my horse was jaded and tired and my impatience
to attend the tournament caused me a disaster which it is well it came not
on the second day

It is dear Arthur How is it I never heard your name mentioned or
that I received no news from any one about you during the wars that have
ended I had more than one personal enemy Bertha men who would have
been glad to see me fall and who in default of that would not have
minded bribing an assassin to secure my death for them at any risk
whatever

Heavens and how did you escape such a death from such people
Arthur By adopting such a device as that I wear The Knight of the
Green Shield I'm called

I saw you to-day in the tournament And there my tired and jaded
horse gave way but to-morrow I shall have I hope a different
fortune

I hope so too I will try my arm has been good in battle and I
see not why it should be deficient in peaceful jousts

Certainly not What fortune have you met with since you left
England I was of course known but to a few among those few were the
general under whom I served and my more immediate officers who I knew
would not divulge my secret

And they did not No kept it nobly and kept their eyes upon me in
battle and I have reaped a rich harvest in force honour and riches I
assure you

Thank Heaven said Bertha Bertha if I be conqueror may I claim
you in the court-yard before all the spectators

You may said Bertha and she hung her head Moreover said Sir
Arthur you will not make a half promise but when I demand you you
will at once come down to me and accept me as your husband if I be the
victor then he cannot object to the match

But he will have many friends and his intended bride will have many
more so that you may run some danger among so many enemies Never
fear for me Bertha because I shall have many friends of distinction
there too many old friends who are tried men in battle and whose deeds
are a glory and honour to them besides I shall have my commander and
several gentlemen who would at once interfere in case any unfair
advantage was attempted to be taken of my supposed weakness

Have you a fresh horse inquired Bertha I have or shall have by
the morning but promise me you will do what I ask you and then my arm
will be nerved to its utmost and I am sure to be victorious

I do promise said Bertha I hope you may be as successful as you
hope to be Arthur but suppose fortune should declare against you
suppose an accident of any kind were to happen what could be done
then I must be content to hide myself for ever afterwards as a
defeated knight how can I appear before your friends as the claimant of
your hand

I will never have any other But you will be forced to accept this
Guthrie de Beaumont your father's chosen son-in-law

I will seek refuge in a cloister Will you fly with me Bertha to
some sequestered spot where we can live in each others society

Yes said Bertha anything save marriage with Guthrie de
Beaumont Then await the tournament of to-morrow said Sir Arthur
and then this may be avoided in the meantime keep up a good heart and
remember I am at hand

                                   

These two lovers parted for the present after a protracted interview
Bertha to her chamber and the Knight of the Green Shield to his tent

The following morning was one of great preparation the lists had been
enlarged and the seats made more commodious for the influx of visitors
appeared to be much greater than had been anticipated

Moreover there were many old warriors of distinction to be present
which made the bridegroom look pale and feel uncomfortable as to the
results of the tournament The tilting was to begin at an early hour
and then the feasting and revelry would begin early in the evening
after the tilting had all passed off

In that day's work there were many thrown from their saddles and many
broke their lances The bridegroom tilted with several knights and came
off victorious or without disadvantage to either

The green knight on the contrary tilted with but few and always
victorious and such matches were with men who had been men of some name
in the wars or at least in the tilt yard

The sports drew to a close and when the bridegroom became the
challenger the Knight of the Green Shield at once rode out quietly to
meet him The encounter could not well be avoided and the bridegroom
would willingly have declined the joust with a knight who had disposed
of his enemies so easily and so unceremoniously as he had

The first encounter was enough the bridegroom was thrown to a great
distance and lay insensible on the ground and was carried out of the
field There was an immediate sensation among the friends of the
bridegroom several of whom rode out to challenge the stranger knight
for his presumption

In this however they had misreckoned the chances for the challenged
accepted their challenges with alacrity and disposed of them one by one
with credit to himself until the day was concluded The stranger was
then asked to declare who he was upon which he lifted his visor and
said

I am Sir Arthur Home and claim the Lady Bertha as my bride by the
laws of arms and by those of love

                                   

Again the tent was felled and again the hostelry was tenanted by the
soldier who declared for one side and then for the other as the cups
clanged and jingled together

Said I not exclaimed one of the troopers that the knight with a
green shield was a good knight You did replied the other

And you knew who he was said another of the troopers Not I
comrades I had seen him fight in battle and therefore partly guessed
how it would be if he had any chance with the bridegroom I'm glad he
has won the lady

It was true the Lady Bertha was won and Sir Arthur Home claimed his
bride and then they attempted to defeat his claim yet Bertha at once
expressed herself in his favour to strongly that they were however
reluctantly compelled to consent at last

At this moment a loud shout as from a multitude of persons came upon
their ears and Flora started from her seat in alarm The cause of the
alarm we shall proceed to detail

THE FUNERAL OF THE STRANGER OF THE INN THE POPULAR COMMOTION AND MRS
CHILLINGWORTH'S APPEAL TO THE MOB THE NEW RIOT THE HALL IN DANGER


Illustration

As yet the town was quiet and though there was no appearance of riot
or disturbance yet the magistracy had taken every precaution they
deemed needful or their position and necessities warranted to secure
the peace of the town from the like disturbance to that which had been
of late a disgrace and terror of peaceably-disposed persons

The populace were well advertised of the fact that the body of the
stranger was to be buried that morning in their churchyard and that to
protect the body should there be any necessity for so doing a large
body of constables would be employed

There was no disposition to riot at least none was visible It looked
as if there was some event about to take place that was highly
interesting to all parties who were peaceably assembling to witness the
interment of nobody knew who

The early hour at which persons were assembling at different points
clearly indicated that there was a spirit of curiosity about the town
so uncommon that none would have noticed it but for the fact of the
crowd of people who hung about the streets and there remained listless
and impatient

The inn too was crowded with visitors and there were many who not
being blessed with the strength of purse that some were were hanging
about in the distance waiting and watching the motions of those who
were better provided

Ah said one of the visitors this is a disagreeable job in your
house landlord Yes sir I'd sooner it had happened elsewhere I
assure you I know it has done me no good

No no man could expect any and yet it is none the less unfortunate
for that I would sooner anything else happen than that whatever it
might be I think it must be something very bad at all events but I
dare say I shall never see the like again

So much the better for the town said another for what with
vampires and riots there has been but little else stirring than
mischief and disturbances of one kind and another

Yes and what between Varneys and Bannerworths we have had but little
peace here

Precisely Do you know it's my opinion that the least thing would upset
the whole town Any one unlucky word would do it I am sure said a
tall thin man

I have no doubt of it said another but I hope the military would do
their duty under such circumstances for people's lives and property are
not safe in such a state of things Oh dear no

I wonder what has become of Varney or where he can have gone
to Some thought he must have been burned when they burned his
house replied the landlord

But I believe it generally understood he's escaped has he not No
traces of his body were found in the ruins None Oh he's escaped
there can be no doubt of that I wish I had some fortune depending upon
the fact it would be mine I am sure

Well the lord keep us from vampires and suchlike cattle said an old
woman I shall never sleep again in my bed with any safety It
frightens one out of one's life to think of it What a shame the men
didn't catch him and stake him

The old woman left the inn as soon as she had spoke this Christian
speech

Humane said a gentleman with a sporting coat on The old woman is
no advocate for half measures

You are right sir said the landlord and a very good look-out she
keeps upon the pot to see it's full and carefully blows the froth
off Ah I thought as much

How soon will the funeral take place landlord inquired a person who
had at that moment entered the inn In about an hour's time sir

Oh the town seems pretty full though it is very quiet I suppose it
is more as a matter of curiosity people congregate to see the funeral of
this stranger

I hope so sir

The time is wearing on and if they don't make a dust why then the
military will not be troubled

I do not expect anything more sir said the landlord for you see
they must have had their swing out as the saying is and be fully
satisfied They cannot have much more to do in the way of exhibiting
their anger or dislike to vampires they all have done enough

So they have so they have

Granted said an old man with a troublesome cough but when did you
ever know a mob to be satisfied If they wanted the moon and got it
they'd find out it would be necessary to have the stars also

That's uncommonly true said the landlord I shouldn't be surprised
if they didn't do something worse than ever Nothing more likely
said the little old man I can believe anything of a mob anything no
matter what

The inn was crowded with visitors and several extra hands were employed
to wait upon the customers and a scene of bustle and activity was
displayed that was never before seen It would glad the heart of a
landlord though he were made of stone and landlords are usually of
much more malleable materials than that

However the landlord had hardly time to congratulate himself for the
bearers were come now and the undertaker and his troop of
death-following officials

There was a stir among the people who began now to awaken from the
lethargy that seemed to have come over them while they were waiting for
the moment when it should arrive that was to place the body under the
green sod against which so much of their anger had been raised There
was a decent silence that pervaded the mob of individuals who had
assembled

Death with all its ghastly insignia had an effect even upon the
unthinking multitude who were ever ready to inflict death or any
violent injury upon any object that came in their way they never
hesitated but even these now the object of their hatred was no more
felt appalled

'Tis strange what a change comes over masses of men as they gaze upon a
dead body It may be that they all know that to that complexion they
must come at last This may be the secret of the respect offered to the
dead

The undertakers are men however who are used to the presence of
death it is their element they gain a living by attending upon the
last obsequies of the dead they are used to dead bodies and care not
for them Some of them are humane men that is in their way and even
among them are men who wouldn't be deprived of the joke as they screwed
down the last screw They could not forbear even on this occasion to
hold their converse when left alone

Jacobs said one who was turning a long screw Jacobs my boy do you
take the chair to-night Yes said Jacobs who was a long
lugubrious-looking man I do take the chair if I live over this
blessed event

You are not croaking Jacobs are you Well you are a lively customer
you are Lively do you expect people to be lively when they are full
dressed for a funeral You are a nice article for your profession You
don't feel like an undertaker you don't

Don't Jacobs my boy As long as I look like one when occasion
demands when I have done my job I puts my comfort in my pocket and
thinks how much more pleasanter it is to be going to other people's
funerals than to our own and then only see the difference as regards
the money

True said Jacobs with a groan but death's a melancholy article at
all events So it is

And then when you come to consider the number of people we have
buried how many have gone to their last homes and how many more will
go the same way Yes yes that's all very well Jacob You are
precious surly this morning I'll come to-night You're brewing a
sentimental tale as sure as eggs is eggs

Well that is pretty certain but as I was saying how many more are
there 

Ah don't bother yourself with calculations that have neither beginning
nor end and which haven't one point to go Come Jacob have you
finished yet Quite said Jacob

They now arranged the pall and placed all in readiness and returned to
a place down stairs where they could enjoy themselves for an odd half
hour and pass that time away until the moment should arrive when his
reverence would be ready to bury the deceased upon consideration of the
fees to be paid upon the occasion

The tap-room was crowded and there was no room for the men and they
were taken into the kitchen where they were seated and earnestly at
work preparing for the ceremony that had so shortly to be performed

Any better Jacobs What do you mean inquired Jacobs with a
groan It's news to me if I have been ill

Oh yes you were doleful up stairs you know I've a proper regard
for my profession that's the difference between you and I you know

I'll wager you what you like now that I'll handle a corpse and drive
a screw in a coffin as well as you now although you are so solid and
miserable So you may so you may

Then what do you mean by saying I haven't a proper regard for my
profession I say you haven't and there's the thing that shall prove
it you don't look it and that's the truth

I don't look like an undertaker indeed I dare say I don't if I ain't
dressed like one Nor when you are reiterated Jacob

Why not pray Because you have always a grin on your face as broad
as a gridiron that's why

This ended the dispute for the employer of the men suddenly put his
head in saying 

Come now time's up you are wanted up stairs all of you Be quick
we shall have his reverence waiting for us and then we shall lose his
recommendation

Ready sir said the round man taking up his pint and finishing it off
at a draught at the same moment he thrust the remains of some bread and
cheese into his pocket

Jacob too took his pot and having finished it with great gravity
followed the example of his more jocose companion and they all left the
kitchen for the room above where the corpse was lying ready for
interment

There was an unusual bustle everybody was on the tip-top of
expectation and awaiting the result in a quiet hurry and hoped to have
the first glimpse of the coffin though why they should do so it was
difficult to define But in this fit of mysterious hope and expectation
they certainly stood

Will they be long inquired a man at the door of one inside will
they be long before they come They are coming now said the man
Do you all keep quiet they are knocking their heads against the top of
the landing Hark There I told you so

The man departed hearing something and being satisfied that he had got
some information

Now then said the landlord move out of the way and allow the
corpse to pass out Let me have no indecent conduct let everything be
as it should be

The people soon removed from the passage and vicinity of the doorway
and then the mournful procession as the newspapers have it moved
forward They were heard coming down stairs and thence along the
passage until they came to the street and then the whole number of
attendants was plainly discernible

How different was the funeral of one who had friends He was alone none
followed save the undertaker and his attendants all of whom looked
solemn from habit and professional motives Even the jocose man was as
supernaturally solemn as could be well imagined indeed nobody knew he
was the same man

Well said the landlord as he watched them down the street as they
slowly paced their way with funereal not sorrowful solemnity well I
am very glad that it is all over

It has been a sad plague to you said one

It has indeed it must be to any one who has had another such a job as
this I don't say it out of any disrespect to the poor man who is dead
and gone quite the reverse but I would not have such another affair on
my hands for pounds

I can easily believe you especially when we come to consider the
disagreeables of a mob

You may say that There's no knowing what they will or won't do
confound them If they'd act like men and pay for what they have why
then I shouldn't care much about them but it don't do to have other
people in the bar

I should think not indeed that would alter the scale of your profits
I reckon

It would make all the difference to me Business added the landlord
conducted on that scale would become a loss and a man might as well
walk into a well at once

So I should say Have many such occurrences as these been usual in this
part of the country inquired the stranger

Not usual at all said the landlord but the fact is the whole
neighbourhood has run distracted about some superhuman being they call a
vampire

Indeed Yes and they suspected the unfortunate man who has been
lying up-stairs a corpse for some days

Oh the man they have just taken in the coffin to bury said the
stranger

Yes sir the same

Well I thought perhaps somebody of great consequence had suddenly
become defunct Oh dear no it would not have caused half the
sensation people have been really mad

It was a strange occurrence altogether I believe was it inquired
the stranger Indeed it was sir I hardly know the particulars there
have been so many tales afloat though they all concur in one point and
that is it has destroyed the peace of one family

Who has done so The vampire

Indeed I never heard of such an animal save as a fable before it
seems to me extraordinary

So it would do to any one sir as was not on the spot to see it I'm
sure I wouldn't

                                   

In the meantime the procession short as it was of itself moved along
in slow time through a throng of people who ran out of their houses on
either side of the way and lined the whole length of the town

Many of these closed in behind and followed the mourners until they
were near the church and then they made a rush to get into the
churchyard

As yet all had been conducted with tolerable propriety the funeral met
with no impediment The presence of death among so many of them seemed
some check upon the licence of the mob who bowed in silence to the
majesty of death

Who could bear ill-will against him who was now no more Man while he
is man is always the subject of hatred fear or love Some one of
these passions in a modified state exists in all men and with such
feelings they will regard each other and it is barely possible that any
one should not be the object of some of these and hence the stranger's
corpse was treated with respect

In silence the body proceeded along the highway until it came to the
churchyard and followed by an immense multitude of people of all
grades

The authorities trembled they knew not what all this portended They
thought it might pass off but it might become a storm first they hoped
and feared by turns till some of them fell sick with apprehension

There was a deep silence observed by all those in the immediate vicinity
of the coffin but those farther in the rear found full expression for
their feelings

Do you think said an old man to another that he will come to life
again eh Oh yes vampires always do and lay in the moonlight and
then they come to life again Moonlight recovers a vampire to life
again

And yet the moonlight is cold Ah but who's to tell what may happen
to a vampire or what's hot or what's cold

Certainly not oh dear no And then they have permission to suck
the blood of other people to live themselves and to make other people
vampires too

The lord have mercy upon us Ay but they have driven a stake
through this one and he can't get in moonlight or daylight it's all
over he's certainly done for we may congratulate ourselves on this
point

So we may so we may

They now neared the grave the clergyman officiating as usual on such
occasions There was a large mob of persons on all sides with serious
faces watching the progress of the ceremony and who listened in
quietness

There was no sign of any disturbance amongst the people and the
authorities were well pleased they congratulated themselves upon the
quietness and orderliness of the assemblage

The service was ended and the coffin lowered and the earth was thrown
on the coffin-lid with a hollow sound Nobody could hear that sound
unmoved But in a short while the sound ceased as the grave became
filled it was then trodden carefully down

There were no relatives there to feel affected at the last scene of all
They were far away and according to popular belief upon the subject
they must have been dead some ages

                                   

The mob watched the last shovel-full of earth thrown upon the coffin
and witnessed the ramming down of the soil and the heaping of it over
at top to make the usual monument for all this was done speedily and
carefully lest there should be any tendency to exhume the body of the
deceased

The people were now somewhat relieved as to their state of solemnity
and silence They would all of them converse freely on the matter that
had so long occupied their thoughts

They seemed now let loose and everybody found himself at liberty to say
or do something no matter if it were not very reasonable that is not
always required of human beings who have souls or at least it is
unexpected and were it expected the expectation would never be
realized

The day was likely to wear away without a riot nay even without a
fight a most extraordinary occurrence for such a place under the
existing circumstances for of late the populace or perhaps the
townspeople were extremely pugnacious and many were the disputes that
were settled by the very satisfactory application of the knuckles to the
head of the party holding a contrary opinion

Thus it was they were ready to take fire and a hubbub would be the
result of the slightest provocation But on the present occasion there
was a remarkable dearth of all subjects of the nature described

Who was to lead Israel out to battle Alas no one on the present
occasion

Such a one however appeared at least one who furnished a ready
excuse for a disturbance

Suddenly Mrs Chillingworth appeared in the midst of a large concourse
of people She had just left her house which was close at hand her
eyes red with weeping and her children around her on this occasion

The crowd made way for her and gathered round her to see what was going
to happen

Friends and neighbours she said can any of you relieve the tears of
a distressed wife and mother have any of you seen anything of my
husband Mr Chillingworth

What the doctor exclaimed one Yes Mr Chillingworth the surgeon
He has not been home two days and a night I'm distracted what can
have become of him I don't know unless 

Here Mrs Chillingworth paused and some person said 

Unless what Mrs Chillingworth there are none but friends here who
wish the doctor well and would do anything to serve him unless what
speak out

Unless he's been destroyed by the vampire Heaven knows what we may all
come to Here am I and my children deprived of our protector by some
means which we cannot imagine He never in all his life did the same
before

He must have been spirited away by some of the vampires I'll tell you
what friend said one to another that something must be done
nobody's safe in their bed

No they are not indeed I think that all vampires ought to be burned
and a stake run through them and then we should be safe

Ay but you must destroy all those who are even suspected of being
vampires or else one may do all the mischief So he might

Hurrah shouted the mob Chillingworth for ever We'll find the
doctor somewhere if we pull down the whole town

There was an immense commotion among the populace who began to start
throwing stones and do all sorts of things without any particular
object and some as they said to find the doctor or to show how
willing they were to do so if they knew how

Mrs Chillingworth however kept on talking to the mob who continued
shouting and the authorities anticipated an immediate outbreak of
popular opinion which is generally accompanied by some forcible
demonstration and on this occasion some one suggested the propriety of
burning down Bannerworth Hall because they had burned down the
vampire's home and they might as well burn down that of the injured
party which was carried by acclamation and with loud shouts they
started on their errand

This was a mob's proceeding all over and we regret very much to say
that it is very much the characteristic of English mobs What an
uncommonly strange thing it is that people in multitudes seem completely
to get rid of all reason all honour all common ordinary honesty
while if you were to take the same people singly you would find that
they were reasonable enough and would shrink with a feeling quite
approaching to horror from anything in the shape of very flagrant
injustice

This can only be accounted for by a piece of cowardice in the human
race which induces them when alone and acting with the full
responsibility of their actions to shrink from what it is quite evident
they have a full inclination to do and will do when having partially
lost their individuality in a crowd they fancy that to a certain
extent they can do so with impunity

The burning of Sir Francis Varney's house although it was one of those
proceedings which would not bear the test of patient examination was
yet when we take all the circumstances into consideration an act
really justifiable and natural in comparison with the one which was now
meditated

Bannerworth Hall had never been the residence even of anyone who had
done the people any injury or given them any offence so that to let it
become a prey to the flames was but a gratuitous act of mischief

It was however or seemed to be doomed for all who have had any
experience in mobs must know how extremely difficult it is to withdraw
them from any impulse once given especially when that impulse as in
the present instance is of a violent character

Down with Bannerworth Hall was the cry Burn it burn it and
augmented by fresh numbers each minute the ignorant and in many
respects ruffianly assemblage soon arrived within sight of what had
been for so many years the bane of the Bannerworths and whatever may
have been the fault of some of that race those faults had been of a
domestic character and not at all such as would interfere with the
public weal

The astonished and almost worn-out authorities hastily now after
having disposed of their prisoners collected together what troops they
could and by the time the misguided or rather the not guided at all
populace had got halfway to Bannerworth Hall they were being
outflanked by some of the dragoons who by taking a more direct route
hoped to reach Bannerworth Hall first and so perhaps by letting the
mob see that it was defended induce them to give up the idea of its
destruction on account of the danger attendant upon the proceeding by
far exceeding any of the anticipated delight of the disturbance

 LXXI

THE STRANGE MEETING AT THE HALL BETWEEN MR CHILLINGWORTH AND THE
MYSTERIOUS FRIEND OF VARNEY


Illustration

When we praise our friend Mr Chillingworth for not telling his wife
where he was going in pursuance of a caution and a discrimination so
highly creditable to him we are quite certain that he has no such
excuse as regards the reader Therefore we say at once that he had his
own reasons now for taking up his abode at Bannerworth Hall for a time
These reasons seemed to be all dependant upon the fact of having met the
mysterious man at Sir Francis Varney's and although we perhaps would
have hoped that the doctor might have communicated to Henry Bannerworth
all that he knew and all that he surmised yet have we no doubt that
what he keeps to himself he has good reasons for so keeping and that
his actions as regards it are founded upon some very just conclusions

He has then made a determination to take possession of and remain in
Bannerworth Hall according to the full and free leave which the admiral
had given him so to do What results he anticipated from so lonely and
so secret a watch we cannot say but probably they will soon exhibit
themselves It needed no sort of extraordinary discrimination for any
one to feel it once that not the least good in the way of an ambuscade
was likely to be effected by such persons as Admiral Bell or Jack
Pringle They were all very well when fighting should actually ensue
but they both were certainly remarkably and completely deficient in
diplomatic skill or in that sort of patience which should enable them
at all to compete with the cunning the skill and the nice
discrimination of such a man as Sir Francis Varney

If anything were to be done in that way it was unquestionably to be done
by some one alone who like the doctor would and could remain
profoundly quiet and await the issue of events be they what they might
and probably remain a spy and attempt no overt act which should be of a
hostile character This unquestionably was the mode and perhaps we
should not be going too far when we say it was the only mode which could
be with anything like safety relied upon as one likely to lead really to
a discovery of Sir Francis Varney's motives in making such determined
exertions to get possession of Bannerworth Hall

That night was doomed to be a very eventful one indeed for on it had
Charles Holland been by a sort of wild impulsive generosity of Sir
Francis Varney rescued from the miserable dungeon in which he had been
confined and on that night too he whom we cannot otherwise describe
than as the villain Marchdale had been in consequence of the evil that
he himself meditated and the crime with which he was quite willing to
stain his soul been condemned to occupy Charles's position

On that night too had the infuriated mob determined upon the
destruction of Bannerworth Hall and on that night was Mr Chillingworth
waiting with what patience he could exert at the Hall for whatever in
the  of accidents might turn up of an advantageous character to
that family in whose welfare and fortunes he felt so friendly and so
deep an interest

Let us look then at the worthy doctor as he keeps his solitary watch

He did not as had been the case when the admiral shared the place with
him in the hope of catching Varney on that memorable occasion when he
caught only his boot sit in a room with a light and the means and
appliances for making the night pass pleasantly away but on the
contrary he abandoned the house altogether and took up a station in
that summer-house which has been before mentioned as the scene of a
remarkable interview between Flora Bannerworth and Varney the vampire

Alone and in the dark so that he could not be probably seen he watched
that one window of the chamber where the first appearance of the hideous
vampire had taken place and which seemed ever since to be the special
object of his attack

By remaining from twilight and getting accustomed to the gradually
increasing darkness of the place no doubt the doctor was able to see
well enough without the aid of any artificial light whether any one was
in the place besides himself

Night after night he said will I watch here until I have succeeded
in unravelling this mystery for that there is some fearful and undreamt
of mystery at the bottom of all these proceedings I am well convinced

When he made such a determination as this Dr Chillingworth was not at
all a likely man to break it so there looking like a modern statue in
the arbour he sat with his eyes fixed upon the balcony and the window
of what used to be called Flora's room for some hours

The doctor was a contemplative man and therefore he did not so acutely
feel the loneliness of his position as many persons would have done
moreover he was decidedly not of a superstitious turn of mind although
certainly we cannot deny an imagination to him However if he really
had harboured some strange fears and terrors they would have been
excusable when we consider how many circumstances had combined to make
it almost a matter of demonstration that Sir Francis Varney was
something more than mortal

What quantities of subjects the doctor thought over during his vigil in
that garden it is hard to say but never in his whole life probably
had he such a glorious opportunity for the most undisturbed
contemplation of subjects requiring deep thought to analyze than as he
had then At least he felt that since his marriage he had never been so
thoroughly quiet and left so completely to himself

It is to be hoped that he succeeded in settling any medical points of a
knotty character that might be hovering in his brain and certain it is
that he had become quite absorbed in an abstruse matter connected with
physiology when his ears were startled and he was at once aroused to a
full consciousness of where he was and why he had come there by the
distant sound of a man's footstep

It was a footstep which seemed to be that of a person who scarcely
thought it at all necessary to use any caution and the doctor's heart
leaped within him as in the lowest possible whisper he said to
himself 

I am successful I am successful It is believed now that the Hall is
deserted and no doubt that is Sir Francis Varney come with confidence
to carry out his object in so sedulously attacking it be that object
what it may

Elated with this idea the doctor listened intently to the advancing
footstep which each moment sounded more clearly upon his ears

It was evidently approaching from the garden entrance towards the house
and he thought by the occasional deadened sound of the person's feet
be he whom he might that he could not see his way very well and
consequently frequently strayed from the path on to some of the
numerous flower-beds which were in the way

Yes said the doctor exultingly it must be Varney and now I have
but to watch him and not to resist him for what good on earth is it to
stop him in what he wishes to do and by such means never wrest his
secret from him The only way is to let him go on and that will I do
most certainly

Now he heard the indistinct muttering of the voice of some one so low
that he could not catch what words were uttered but he fancied that in
the deep tones he recognised without any doubt the voice of Sir
Francis Varney

It must be he he said it surely must be he Who else would come
here to disturb the solitude of an empty house He comes he comes

Now the doctor could see a figure emerge from behind some thick beeches
which had before obstructed his vision and he looked scrutinisingly
about while some doubts stole slowly over his mind now as to whether it
was the vampire or not The height was in favour of the supposition that
it was none other than Varney but the figure looked so much stouter
that Mr Chillingworth felt a little staggered upon the subject and
unable wholly to make up his mind upon it

The pausing of this visitor too opposite that window where Sir Francis
Varney had made his attempts was another strong reason why the doctor
was inclined to believe it must be him and yet he could not quite make
up his mind upon the subject so as to speak with certainty

A very short time however indeed must have sufficed to set such a
question as that at rest and patience seemed the only quality of mind
necessary under those circumstances for Mr Chillingworth to exert

The visitor continued gazing either at that window or at the whole
front of the house for several minutes and then he turned away from a
contemplation of it and walked slowly along parallel with the windows
of that dining-room one of which had been broken so completely on the
occasion of the admiral's attempt to take the vampire prisoner

The moment the stranger altered his position from looking at the
window and commenced walking away from it Mr Chillingworth's mind was
made up It was not Varney of that he felt now most positively assured
and could have no doubt whatever upon the subject

The gait the general air the walk all were different and then arose
the anxious question of who could it be that had intruded upon that
lonely place and what could be the object of any one else but Varney
the vampire to do so

The stranger looked a powerful man and walked with a firm tread and
altogether he was an opponent that had the doctor been ever so
belligerently inclined it would have been the height of indiscretion
for him to attempt to cope with

It was a very vexatious thing too for any one to come there at such a
juncture perhaps only from motives of curiosity or possibly just to
endeavour to commit some petty depredations upon the deserted building
if possible and most heartily did the doctor wish that in some way he
could scare away the intruder

The man walked along very slowly indeed and seemed to be quite taking
his time in making his observations of the building and this was the
more provoking as it was getting late and if having projected a visit
at all it would surely soon be made and then when he found any one
there of course he would go

Amazed beyond expression the doctor felt about on the ground at his
feet until he found a tolerably large stone which he threw at the
stranger with so good an aim that it hit him a smart blow on the back
which must have been anything but a pleasant surprise

That it was a surprise and that too a most complete one was evident
from the start which the man gave and then he uttered a furious oath
and rubbed his back as he glanced about him to endeavour to ascertain
from whence the missile had come

I'll try him again with that thought the doctor it may succeed in
scaring him away and he stooped to watch for another stone

It was well that he did so at that precise moment for before he rose
again he heard the sharp report of a pistol and a crashing sound among
some of the old wood work of which the summer-house was composed told
him that a shot had there taken effect Affairs were now getting much
too serious and accordingly Dr Chillingworth thought that rather
than stay there to be made a target of he would face the intruder

Hold hold he cried Who are you and what do you mean by
that Oh somebody is there cried the man as he advanced My
friend whoever you are you were very foolish to throw a stone at me

And my friend whoever you are responded the doctor you were very
spiteful to fire a pistol bullet at me in consequence 

Not at all

But I say yes for probably I can prove a right to be here which you
cannot Ah said the stranger that voice why you are Dr
Chillingworth

I am but I don't know you said the doctor as he emerged now from
the summer-house and confronted the stranger who was within a few paces
of the entrance to it Then he started as he added 

Yes I do know you though How in the name of Heaven came you here
and what purpose have you in so coming

What purpose have you Since we met at Varney's I have been making
some inquiries about this neighbourhood and learn strange
things That you may very easily do here and what is more
extraordinary the strange things are for the most part I can assure
you quite true

The reader will from what has been said now readily recognise this man
as Sir Francis Varney's mysterious visitor to whom he gave from some
hidden cause or another so large a sum of money and between whom and
Dr Chillingworth a mutual recognition had taken place on the occasion
when Sir Francis Varney had with such cool assurance invited the
admiral to breakfast with him at his new abode

You however said the man I have no doubt are fully qualified to
tell me of more than I have been able to learn from other people and
first of all let me ask you why you are here Before I answer you
that question or any other said the doctor let me beg of you to
tell me truly is Sir Francis Varney 

The doctor whispered in the ear of the stranger some name as if he
feared even there in the silence of that garden where everything
conspired to convince him that he could not be overheard to pronounce
it in an audible tone

He is said the other You have no manner of doubt of it

Doubt certainly not What doubt can I have I know it for a positive
certainty and he knows of course that I do know it and has purchased
my silence pretty handsomely although I must confess that nothing but
my positive necessities would have induced me to make the large demands
upon him that I have and I hope soon to be able to release him
altogether from them

The doctor shook his head repeatedly as he said 

I suspected it I suspected it do you know from the first moment that
I saw you there in his house His face haunted me ever since awfully
haunted me and yet although I felt certain that I had once seen it
under strange circumstances I could not identify it with but no
matter no matter I am waiting here for him

Indeed Ay that I am and I flung a stone at you not knowing you
with hope that you would be by such means perhaps scared away and so
leave the coast clear for him

Then you have an appointment with him By no means but he has made
such repeated and determined attacks upon this house that the family who
inhabited it were compelled to leave it and I am here to watch him and
ascertain what can possibly be his object

It is as I suspected then muttered this man Confound him Now can
I read as if in a book most clearly the game that he is playing

Can you cried the doctor energetically can you What is it Tell
me for that is the very thing I want to discover You don't say so

It is indeed and I assure you that it concerns the peace of a whole
family to know it You say you have made inquiries about this
neighbourhood and if you have done so you have discovered how the
family of the Bannerworths have been persecuted by Varney and how in
particular Flora Bannerworth a beautiful and intelligent girl has
been most cruelly made to suffer

I have heard all that and I dare say with many exaggerations It
would be difficult for any one really to exaggerate the horrors that
have taken place in this house so that any information which you can
give respecting the motives of Varney will tend probably to restore
peace to those who have been so cruelly persecuted and be an act of
kindness which I think not altogether inconsistent with your nature

You think so and yet know who I am I do indeed

And what I am Why if I were to go into the market-place of yon town
and proclaim myself would not all shun me ay even the very lowest and
vilest and yet you talk of an act of kindness not being altogether
inconsistent with my nature I do because I know something more of
you than many

There was a silence of some moments duration and then the stranger
spoke in a tone of voice which looked as if he were struggling with some
emotion

Sir you do know more of me than many You know what I have been and
you know how I left an occupation which would have made me loathed But
you even you do not know what made me take to so terrible a
trade I do not

Would it suit you for me now to tell you Will you first promise me
that you will do all you can for this persecuted family of the
Bannerworths in whom I take so strange an interest

I will I promise you that freely Of my own knowledge of course I
can say but little concerning them but upon that warranting I well
believe they deserve abundant sympathy and from me they shall have it

A thousand thanks With your assistance I have little doubt of being
able to extricate them from the tangled web of dreadful incidents which
has turned them from their home and now whatever you may choose to
tell me of the cause which drove you to be what you became I shall
listen to with abundant interest Only let me beseech you to come into
this summer-house and to talk low

I will and you can pursue your watch at the same time while I beguile
its weariness Be it so

You knew me years ago when I had all the chances in the world of
becoming respectable and respected I did indeed and you may
therefore judge of my surprise when some years since being in the
metropolis I met you and you shunned my company Yes but at last
you found out why it was that I shunned your company

I did You yourself told me once that I met you and would not leave
you but insisted upon your dining with me Then you told me when you
found that I would take no other course whatever that you were no other
than the the   

Out with it I can bear to hear it now better than I could then I told
you that I was the common hangman of London

You did I must confess to my most intense surprise

Yes and yet you kept to me and but that I respected you too much to
allow you to do so you would from old associations have countenanced
me but I could not and I would not let you do so I told you then
that although I held the terrible office that I had not been yet
called upon to perform its loathsome functions Soon soon come the
first effort it was the last

Indeed You left the dreadful trade

I did I did But what I want to tell you for I could not then was
why I went ever to it The wounds my heart had received were then too
fresh to allow me to speak of them but I will tell you now The story
is a brief one Mr Chillingworth I pray you be seated




 LXXII

THE STRANGE STORY THE ARRIVAL OF THE MOB AT THE HALL AND THEIR
DISPERSION


Illustration

You will find that the time which elapsed since I last saw you in
London to have been spent in an eventful varied manner You were in
good circumstances then said Mr Chillingworth I was but many
events happened after that which altered the prospect made it even more
gloomy than you can well imagine but I will tell you all candidly and
you can keep watch upon Bannerworth Hall at the same time You are well
aware that I was well to do and had ample funds and inclination to
spend them I recollect but you were married then surely I
was said the stranger sadly I was married then And now I am
a widower The stranger seemed much moved but after a moment or so
he resumed I am a widower now but how that event came about is partly
my purpose to tell you I had not married long that is very long for I
have but one child and she is not old or of an age to know much more
than what she may be taught she is still in the course of education I
was early addicted to gamble the dice had its charms as all those who
have ever engaged in play but too well know it is perfectly
fascinating So I have heard said Mr Chillingworth though for
myself I found a wife and professional pursuits quite incompatible with
any pleasure that took either time or resources 

It is so I would I had never entered one of those houses where men are
deprived of their money and their own free will for at the
gambling-table you have no liberty save that in gliding down the stream
in company with others How few have ever escaped destruction none I
believe men are perfectly fascinated it is ruin alone that enables a
man to see how he has been hurried onwards without thought or
reflection and how fallacious were all the hopes he ever entertained
Yes ruin and ruin alone can do this but alas tis then too
late the evil is done Soon after my marriage I fell in with a
Chevalier St John He was a man of the world in every sense of the
word and one that was well versed in all the ways of society I never
met with any man who was so perfectly master of himself and of perfect
ease and self-confidence as he was He was never at a loss and come
what would never betrayed surprise or vexation two qualities he
thought never ought to be shown by any man who moved in society 

Indeed He was a strange man a very strange man 

Did he gamble 

It is difficult to give you a correct and direct answer I should say
he did and yet he never lost or won much but I have often thought he
was more connected with those who did than was believed 

Was that a fact inquired Mr Chillingworth 

You shall see as we go on and be able to judge for yourself I have
thought he was Well he first took me to a handsome saloon where
gambling was carried on We had been to the opera As we came out he
recommended that we should sup at a house where he was well known and
where he was in the habit of spending his evenings after the opera and
before he retired I agreed to this I saw no reason why I should not
We went there and bitterly have I repented of so doing for years since
and do to this day 

Your repentance has been sincere and lasting said Mr Chillingworth
the one proves the other It does but I thought not so then The
place was glittering and the wine good It was a kind of earthly
paradise and when we had taken some wine the chevalier said to me 

'I am desirous of seeing a friend backwards he is at the hazard-table
Will you go with me I hesitated I feared to see the place where a
vice was carried on I knew myself inclined to prudential motives I
said to him No St John I'll wait here for you it may be as
well the wine is good and it will content me'

'Do so he said smiling but remember I seldom or never play myself
nor is there any reason why you should I'll go but I will not
play Certainly not you are free alike to look on play or quit the
place at any moment you please and not be noticed probably by a
single soul'

I arose and we walked backwards having called one of the men who were
waiting about but who were watchers and door-keepers of the hell We
were led along the passage and passed through the pair of doors which
were well secured and rendered the possibility of a surprise almost
impossible After these dark places we were suddenly let into a place
where we were dazzled by the light and brilliancy of the saloon It was
not so large as the one we left but it was superior to it in all its
appointments

At first I could not well see who was or who was not in the room
where we were As soon however as I found the use of my eyes I
noticed many well-dressed men who were busily engaged in play and who
took no notice of any one who entered We walked about for some minutes
without speaking to any one but merely looking on I saw men engaged in
play some with earnestness others again with great nonchalance and
money changed hands without the least remark There were but few who
spoke and only those in play There was a hum of conversation but you
could not distinguish what was said unless you paid some attention to
and was in close vicinity with the individual who spoke

'Well said St John what do you think of this place Why I
replied I had no notion of seeing a place fitted up as this is'

'No isn't it superb It is beautifully done They have many
visitors said I many more than I could have believed'

'Yes they are all bona fide players men of stamp and rank none of
your seedy legs who have only what they can cheat you out
of Ah And besides he added you may often form friendships
here that lead to fortune hereafter I do not mean in play because
there is no necessity for your doing so or if you do so in going
above a stake which you know won't hurt you Exactly'

'Many men can never approach a table like this and sit down to an
hour's play but if they do they must stake not only more than they
can afford but all their property leaving themselves beggars They
do said I

'But men who know themselves their resources and choose to indulge
for a time may often come and lay the foundation to a very pretty
fortune'

'Do you see your friend I inquired No I do not but I will
inquire if he has been here if not we will go'

He left me for a moment or two to make some inquiry and I stood
looking at the table where there were four players and who seemed to
be engaged at a friendly game and when one party won they looked grave
and when the other party lost they smiled and looked happy I walked
away as the chevalier did not return immediately to me and then I saw
a gentleman rise up from a table He had evidently lost I was standing
by the seat unconsciously holding the back in my hand I sat down
without thinking or without speaking and found myself at the hazard
table

'Do you play sir Yes I said I had hardly uttered the words when
I was sorry for them but I could not recall them I sat down and play
at once commenced

In about ten or fifteen minutes often losing and then winning I found
myself about a hundred and twenty pounds in pocket clear gain by the
play

'Ah said the chevalier who came up at that moment I thought you
wouldn't play I really don't know how it happened said I but I
suddenly found myself here without any previous intention'

'You are not a loser I hope Indeed I am not I replied but not
much a gainer'

'Nor need you desire to be Do you desire to give your adversary his
revenge now or take another opportunity At another time I
replied

'You will find me here the day after to-morrow when I shall be at your
service then bowing he turned away

'He is a very rich man whom you have been playing with said the
chevalier 

Indeed

'Yes and I have known him to lose for three days together but you may
take his word for any amount he is a perfect gentleman and man of
honour 'Tis well to play with such I replied but I suppose you
are about to leave'

'Yes it grows late and I have some business to transact to-morrow so
I must leave I will accompany you part of the way home said I
'and then I shall have finished the night'

I did leave with him and accompanied him home and then walked to my
own home

                                   

This was my first visit and I thought a propitious beginning but it
was the more dangerous Perhaps a loss might have effectually deterred
me but it is doubtful to tell how certain events might have been
altered It is just possible that I might have been urged on by my
desire to retrieve any loss I might have incurred and so made myself at
once the miserable being it took months to accomplish in bringing me to

I went the day but one after this to meet the same individual at the
gambling-table and played some time with varied success until I left
off with a trifling loss upon the night's play which was nothing of any
consequence

Illustration

Thus matters went on I sometimes won and sometimes lost until I won a
few hundreds and this determined me to play for higher stakes than any
I had yet played for

It was no use going on in the peddling style I had been going on I had
won two hundred and fifty pounds in three months and had I been less
fearful I might have had twenty-five thousand pounds Ah I'll try my
fortune at a higher game

Having once made this resolution I was anxious to begin my new plan
which I hoped would have the effect of placing me far above my then
present position in society which was good and with a little attention
it would have made me an independent man but then it required patience
and nothing more However the other method was so superior since it
might all be done with good luck in a few months Ah good luck how
uncertain is good luck how changeful is fortune how soon is the best
prospect blighted by the frosts of adversity In less than a month I had
lost more than I could pay and then I gambled on for a living

My wife had but one child her first and only one an infant at her
breast but there was a change came over her for one had come over
me a fearful one it was too one not only in manner but in fortune too
She would beg me to come home early to attend to other matters and
leave the dreadful life I was then leading

'Lizzy said I we are ruined Ruined she exclaimed and
staggered back until she fell into a seat Ruined'

'Ay ruined It is a short word but expressive No no we are not
ruined I know what you mean you would say we cannot live as we have
lived we must retrench and so we will right willingly'

'You must retrench most wonderfully I said with desperate calmness
'for the murder must out And so we will but you will be with us
you will not go out night after night ruining your health our
happiness and destroying both peace and prospects'

'No no Lizzy we have no chance of recovering ourselves house and
home all gone all all My God she exclaimed

'Ay rail on said I you have cause enough but no matter we have
lost all How how'

'It is useless to ask how I have done and there is an end of the
matter you shall know more another day we must leave this house for a
lodging It matters little she said all may be won again if you
will but say you will quit the society of those who have ruined you'

'No one said I has ruined me I did it it was no fault of any one
else's I have not that excuse I am sure you can recover'

'I may some day fortune will shower her favours upon me and I live on
in that expectation You cannot mean that you will chance the
gaming-table for I am sure you must have lost all there'

'I have God help me she said you have done your child a wrong
but you may repair it yet'

'Never 'Tis a long day let me implore you on my knees to leave
this place and adopt some other mode of life we can be careful a
little will do and we shall in time be equal to and better than what
we have been'

'We never can save by chance And by chance we never shall she
replied if you will exert yourself we may yet retrieve ourselves'

'And exert myself I will And quit the gaming-table'

'Ask me to make no promises said I I may not be able to keep them
therefore ask me to make none I do ask you beg of entreat of you
to promise and solemnly promise me that you will leave that fearful
place where men not only lose all their goods but the feelings of
nature also'

'Say no more Lizzy if I can get a living elsewhere I will but if
not I must get it there'

She seemed to be cast down at this and she shed tears I left the
room and again went to the gambling-house and there that night I won
a few pounds which enabled me to take my wife and child away from the
house they had so long lived in and took them afterwards to a miserable
place one room where indeed there were a few articles of furniture
that I had saved from the general wreck of my own property

She took things much less to heart than I could have anticipated she
seemed cheerful and happy she endeavoured to make my home as
comfortable as she could

Her whole endeavour was to make me as much as possible forget the
past She wanted as much as possible to wean me away from my gambling
pursuits but that was impossible I had no hope no other prospect

Thus she strove but I could see each day she was getting paler and
more pale her figure before round was more thin and betrayed signs
of emaciation This preyed upon me and when fortune denied me the
means of carrying home that which she so much wanted I could never
return for two days at a time Then I would find her shedding tears and
sighing what could I say If I had anything to take her then I used to
endeavour to make her forget that I had been away

'Ah she would exclaim you will find me dead one of these days what
you do now for one or two days you will do by-and-bye for many days
perhaps weeks Do not anticipate evil'

'I cannot do otherwise were you in any other kind of employment but
that of gambling she said I should have some hope of you but as it
is there is none Speak not of it my chances may turn out
favourable yet and you may be again as you were'

'Never But fortune is inconstant and may change in my favour as
much as she has done in others'

'Fortune is indeed constant but misfortune is as inconstant You
are prophetic of evil

'Ah I would to Heaven I could predict good but who ever yet heard of
a ruined gambler being able to retrieve himself by the same means that
he was ruined'

Thus we used to converse but our conversation was usually of but
little comfort to either of us for we could give neither any comfort to
the other and as that was usually the case our interviews became less
frequent and of less duration My answer was always the same

'I have no other chance my prospects are limited to that one place
deprive me of that and I never more should be able to bring you a
mouthful of bread'

Day after day day after day the same result followed and I was as
far from success as ever I was and ever should be I was yet a beggar

The time flew by my little girl was nearly four years old but she
knew not the misery her father and mother had to endure The poor little
thing sometimes went without more than a meal a day and while I was
living thus upon the town upon the chances of the gaming-table many a
pang did she cause me and so did her mother My constant consolation
was this 

'It is bad luck now I would say but will be better by-and-bye
things cannot always continue thus It is all for them all for them'

I thought that by continuing constantly in one course I must be at
land at the ebb of the tide It cannot always flow one way I thought
I had often heard people say that if you could but have the resolution
to play on you must in the end seize the turn of fortune

'If I could but once do that I would never enter a hell again as long
as I drew breath'

This was a resolve I could not only make but keep because I had
suffered so much that I would never run through the same misery again
that I had already gone through However fortune never seemed inclined
to take the turn I had hoped for fortune was as far off as ever and
had in no case given me any opportunity of recovering myself

A few pounds were the utmost I could at any time muster and I had to
keep up something of an appearance and seem as if I had a thousand a
year when God knows I could not have mustered a thousandth part of
that sum were all done and paid for

Day after day passed on and yet no change I had almost given myself
up to despair when one night when I went home I saw my wife was more
than usually melancholy and sad and perhaps ill I didn't look at
her I seldom did because her looks were always a reproach to me I
could not help feeling them so

'Well said I I have come home to you because I have something to
bring you not what I ought but what I can you must be satisfied I
am she said

'I know also you want it how is the child is she quite well Yes
quite'

'Where is she inquired I looking round the room but I didn't see
her she used to be up She has gone to bed she said

'It is very early Yes but she cried so for food that I was obliged
to get her to sleep to forget her hunger poor thing she has wanted
bread very badly'

'Poor thing I said let her be awakened and partake of what I have
brought home'

With that my wife waked her up and the moment she opened her eyes she
again began to cry for food which I immediately gave her and saw her
devour with the utmost haste and hunger The sight smote my heart and
my wife sat by watching and endeavouring to prevent her from eating so
fast

'This is bad I said Yes but I hope it may be the worst she
replied in a deep and hollow voice

'Lizzy I exclaimed what is the matter are you ill Yes very
ill'

'What is the matter with you For God's sake tell me I said for I
was alarmed I am very ill she said very ill indeed I feel my
strength decreasing every day I must drink'

You too want food I have and perhaps do though the desire to eat
seems almost to have left me'

'For Heaven's sake eat said I I will bring you home something more
by to-morrow eat and drink Lizzy I have suffered but for you and your
child's sake I will do my best Your best she said will kill us
both but alas there is no other aid at hand You may one day
however come here too late to find us living'

'Say no more Lizzy you know not my feelings when you speak thus
alas I have no hope no aid no friend No she replied your love
of gaming drove them from you because they would not aid a gambler'

'Say no more Lizzy I said if there be not an end to this life
soon there will be an end to me In two days more I shall return to
you Good bye God bless you Keep up your heart and the child Good
bye she said sorrowfully She shed tears and wrung her hands
bitterly I hastened away my heart was ready to burst and I could not
speak

I walked about to recover my serenity but could not do so sufficiently
well to secure anything like an appearance that would render me fit to
go to the gaming-house That night I remained away but I could not
avoid falling into a debauch to drown my misfortunes and shift the
scene of misery that was continually before my eyes

                                   

The next night I was at the gaming-house I went there in better than
usual spirits I saw I thought a change in fortune and hailed that as
the propitious moment of my life when I was to rise above my present
misfortunes

I played and won played and lost played and won and then lost again
thus I went on fluctuating more and more until I found I was getting
money in my pocket I had at one moment more than three hundred pounds
in my pocket and I felt that then was my happy moment then the tide of
fortune was going in my favour I ought to have left off with that to
have been satisfied with such an amount of money but the demon of
avarice seemed to have possessed me and I went on and on with
fluctuating fortune until I lost the whole of it

I was mad desperate and could have destroyed myself but I thought of
the state my wife and child were in I thought that that night they
would want food but they could not hurt for one day they must have
some or would procure some

I was too far gone to be able to go to them even if I were possessed
of means but I had none and daylight saw me in a deep sleep from
which I awoke not until the next evening let in and then I once more
determined that I would make a desperate attempt to get a little money
I had always paid and thought my word would be taken for once and if
I won all well and good if not then I was no worse off than before

This was easy to plan but not to execute I went there but there were
none present in whom I had sufficient interest to dare make the attempt
I walked about and felt in a most uncomfortable state I feared I
should not succeed at all then what was to become of me of my wife and
child This rendered me almost mad I could not understand what I was to
do what to attempt or where to go One or two persons came up and
asked me if I were ill My answers were that I was well enough Good
God how far from the truth was that but I found I must place more
control on my feelings else I should cause much conversation and then
I should lose all hope of recovering myself and all prospect of living
even

At length some one did come in and I remarked I had been there all the
evening and had not played I had an invitation to play with him which
ended by a little sleight of hand in my favour and on that I had
calculated as much as on any good fortune I might meet The person I
played with observed it not and when we left off playing I had some
six or seven pounds in pocket This to me was a very great sum and
the moment I could decently withdraw myself I ran off home

I was fearful of the scene that awaited me I expected something worse
than I had yet seen Possibly Lizzy might be angry and scold as well
as complain I therefore tapped at the door gently but heard no one
answer but of this I took no notice as I believed that they might be
and were most probably fast asleep I had provided myself with a
light and I therefore opened the door which was not fastened

'Lizzy said I Lizzy There was no answer given and I paused
Everything was as still as death I looked on the bed there lay my wife
with her clothes on

'Lizzy Lizzy said I But still she did not answer me

'Well said I she sleeps sound and I walked towards the bed and
placed my hand upon her shoulder and began to shake her saying as I
did so 

'Lizzy Lizzy I'm come home But still no answer or signs of
awaking

I went on the other side of the bed to look at her face and some
misgivings overtook me I trembled much She lay on the bed with her
back towards the spot where I stood

I came towards her face My hand shook violently as I endeavoured to
look at her She had her eyes wide open as if staring at me

'Lizzy said I No answer was returned I then placed my hand upon her
cheek It was enough and I started back in great horror She was dead

This was horror itself I staggered back and fell into a chair The
light I placed down Heaven knows how or why but there I sat staring at
the corpse of my unfortunate wife I can hardly tell you the tremendous
effect this had upon me I could not move I was fascinated to the spot
I could not move and could not turn

                                   

It was morning and the rays of the sun illumined the apartment but
there sat I still gazing upon the face of my unfortunate wife I saw I
knew she was dead but yet I had not spoken but sat looking at her

I believe my heart was as cold as she was but extreme horror and dread
had dried up all the warm blood in my body and I hardly think there was
a pulsation left The thoughts of my child never once seemed to cross my
mind I had however sat there long some hours before I was
discovered and this was by the landlady

I had left the door open behind me and she in passing down had the
curiosity to peep and saw me sitting in what she thought to be a very
strange attitude and could hear no sounds

After some time she discovered my wife was dead and for some time
she thought me so too However she was convinced to the contrary and
then began to call for assistance This awoke the child which was
nearly famished The landlady to become useful and to awaken me from
my lethargy placed the child in my hands telling me I was the best
person now to take care of it

And so I was there was no doubt of the truth of that and I was
compelled to acknowledge it I felt much pride and pleasure in my
daughter and determined she should if I starved have the benefit of
all I could do for her in the way of care &c

                                   

The funeral over I took my child and carried it to a school where I
left her and paid in advance promising to do so as often as the
quarter came round My wife I had seen buried by the hands of man and I
swore I would do the best for my child and to keep this oath was a work
of pleasure

I determined also I would never more enter a gaming-house be the
extremity what it might I would suffer even death before I would permit
myself to enter the house in which it took place

'I will I thought obtain some employment of some kind or other I
could surely obtain that I have only to ask and I have it
surely something however menial that would keep me and my child Yes
yes she ought she must have her charges paid at once

The effect of my wife's death was a very great shock to me and such a
one I could not forget one I shall ever remember and one that at least
made a lasting impression upon me

                                   

Strange but true I never entered a gambling-house it was my horror
and my aversion And yet I could obtain no employment I took my
daughter and placed her at a boarding-school and tried hard to obtain
bread by labour but do what would none could be had if my soul
depended upon it I could find none I cared not what it was anything
that was honest

I was reduced low very low gaunt starvation showed itself in my
cheeks but I wandered about to find employment none could be found
and the world seemed to have conspired together to throw me back to the
gaming-table

But this I would not At last employment was offered but what was it
The situation of common hangman was offered me The employment was
disgusting and horrible but at the same time it was all I could get
and that was a sufficient inducement for me to accept of it I was
therefore the common executioner and in that employment for some time
earned a living It was terrible but necessity compelled me to accept
the only thing I could obtain You now know the reason why I became what
I have told you

THE VISIT OF THE VAMPIRE THE GENERAL MEETING


Illustration

The mysterious friend of Mr Chillingworth finished his narrative and
then the doctor said to him 

And that then is the real cause why you a man evidently far above
the position of life which is usually that of those who occupy the
dreadful post of executioner came to accept of it The real reason
sir I considered too that in holding such a humiliating situation
that I was justly served for the barbarity of which I had been guilty
for what can be a greater act of cruelty than to squander as I did in
the pursuit of mad excitement those means which should have rendered my
home happy and conduced to the welfare of those who were dependant upon
me

I do not mean to say that your self-reproaches are unjust altogether
but What noise is that do you hear anything 

Yes yes

What do you take it to be It seemed like the footsteps of a number
of persons and it evidently approaches nearer and nearer I know not
what to think

Shall I tell you said a deep-toned voice and some one through the
orifice in the back of the summer-house which it will be recollected
sustained some damage at the time that Varney escaped from it laid a
hand upon Mr Chillingworth's shoulder God bless me exclaimed the
doctor who's that and he sprang from his seat with the greatest
perturbation in the world

Varney the vampire added the voice and then both the doctor and his
companion recognised it and saw the strange haggard features that now
they knew so well confronting them There was a pause of surprise for
a moment or two on the part of the doctor and then he said Sir
Francis Varney what brings you here I conjure you to tell me in the
name of common justice and common feeling what brings you to this house
so frequently You have dispossessed the family whose property it is
of it and you have caused great confusion and dismay over a whole
county I implore you now not in the language of menace or as an enemy
but as the advocate of the oppressed and one who desires to see justice
done to all to tell me what it is you require

There is no time now for explanation said Varney if explanations
were my full and free intent You wished to know what noise was that you
heard

I did can you inform me I can The wild and lawless mob which you
and your friends first induced to interfere in affairs far beyond their
or your control are now flushed with the desire of riot and of plunder
The noise you hear is that of their advancing footsteps they come to
destroy Bannerworth Hall

Can that be possible The Bannerworth family are the sufferers from all
that has happened and not the inflictors of suffering Ay be it so
but he who once raises a mob has raised an evil spirit which in the
majority of cases it requires a far more potent spell than he is master
of to quell again

It is so That is a melancholy truth but you address me Sir Francis
Varney as if I led on the mob when in reality I have done all that lay
in my power from the very first moment of their rising on account of
this affair which in the first instance was your work to prevent
them from proceeding to acts of violence It may be so but if you
have now any regard for your own safety you will quit this place It
will too soon become the scene of a bloody contention A large party of
dragoons are even now by another route coming towards it and it will be
their duty to resist the aggressions of the mob then should the rioters
persevere you can guess the result I can indeed

Retire then while you may and against the bad deeds of Sir Francis
Varney at all events place some of his good ones that he may not seem
wholly without one redeeming trait I am not accustomed said the
doctor to paint the devil blacker than he really is but yet the cruel
persecutions that the Bannerworth family have endured call aloud for
justice You still with a perseverance which shows you regardless of
what others suffer so that you compass your own ends hover round a spot
which you have rendered desolate

Hark sir do you not hear the tramp of horses feet I do

The noise made by the feet of the insurgents was now almost drowned in
the louder and more rapid tramp of the horses feet of the advancing
dragoons and in a few moments more Sir Francis Varney waved his arm
exclaiming 

They are here Will you not consult your safety by flight No said
Mr Chillingworth's companion we prefer remaining here at the risk
even of whatever danger may accrue to us

Fools would you die in a chance melee between an infuriated populace
and soldiery Do not leave whispered the ex-hangman to Mr
Chillingworth do not leave I pray you He only wants to have the Hall
to himself

There could be no doubt now of the immediate appearance of the cavalry
and before Sir Francis Varney could utter another word a couple of the
foremost of the soldiers cleared the garden fence at a part where it was
low and alighted not many feet from the summer-house in which this
short colloquy was taking place Sir Francis Varney uttered a bitter
oath and immediately disappeared in the gloom

What shall we do said the hangman You can do what you like but I
shall avow my presence to the military and claim to be on their side in
the approaching contest if it should come to one which I sincerely
hope it will not

The military detachment consisted of about twenty-five dragoons who now
were all in the gardens An order was given by the officer in command
for them to dismount which was at once obeyed and the horses were
fastened by their bridles to the various trees with which the place
abounded

They are going to oppose the mob on foot with their carbines said
the hangman there will be sad work here I am afraid Well at all
events said Mr Chillingworth I shall decline acting the part of a
spy here any longer so here goes

Hilloa a friend a friend here in the summer-house

Make it two friends cried the hangman if you please while you are
about it

A couple of the dragoons immediately appeared and the doctor with his
companion were marched as prisoners before the officer in command

What do you do here he said I was informed that the Hall was
deserted Here orderly where is Mr Adamson the magistrate who came
with me Close at hand sir and he says he's not well

Well or ill he must come here and do something with these people

A magistrate of the district who had accompanied the troops and been
accommodated with a seat behind one of the dragoons which seemed very
much to have disagreed with him for he was as pale as death now
stepped forward

You know me Mr Adamson said the doctor I am Mr
Chillingworth Oh yes Lord bless you how came you here

Never mind that just now you can vouch for my having no connection
with the rioters Oh dear yes certainly This is a respectable
gentleman Captain Richardson and a personal friend of mine

Oh very good And I said the doctor's companion am likewise a
respectable and useful member of society and a great friend of Mr
Chillingworth

Well gentlemen said the captain in command you may remain here if
you like and take the chances or you may leave

They intimated that they preferred remaining and almost at the moment
that they did so a loud shout from many throats announced the near
approach of the mob Now Mr Magistrate if you please said the
officer you will be so good as to tell the mob that I am here with my
troop under your orders and strongly advise them to be off while they
can with whole skins for if they persevere in attacking the place we
must persevere in defending it and if they have half a grain of sense
among them they can surely guess what the result of that will be

I will do the best I can as Heaven is my judge said the magistrate
to produce a peaceable recall more no man can do

Hurrah hurrah shouted the mob down with the vampire down with
the Hall and then one more candid than his fellows shouted Down
with everything and everybody

Ah remarked the officer that fellow now knows what he came about

A great number of torches and links were lighted by the mob but the
moment the glare of light fell upon the helmets and accoutrements of the
military there was a pause of consternation on the part of the
multitude and Mr Adamson urged on by the officer who it was
evident by no means liked the service he was on took advantage of the
opportunity and stepping forward he said 

My good people and fellow townsmen let me implore you to listen to
reason and go to your homes in peace If you do not but on the
contrary in defiance of law and good order persist in attacking this
house it will become my painful duty to read the riot act and then the
military and you will have to fight it out together which I beg you
will avoid for you know that some of you will be killed and a lot more
of you receive painful wounds Now disperse let me beg of you at
once

There seemed for a moment a disposition among the mob to give up the
contest but there were others among them who were infuriated with
drink and so regardless of all consequences Those set up a shout of
Down with the red coats we are Englishmen and will do what we like
Some one then threw a heavy stone which struck one of the soldiers and
brought blood from his cheek The officer saw it but he said at once 

Stand firm now stand firm No anger steady

Twenty pounds for the man who threw that stone said the
magistrate Twenty pound ten for old Adamson the magistrate cried a
voice in the crowd which no doubt came from him who had cast the
missile

Then at least fifty stones were thrown some of which hit the
magistrate and the remainder came rattling upon the helmets of the
dragoons like a hail shower

I warn you and beg of you to go said Mr Adamson for the sake of
your wives and families I beg of you not to pursue this desperate
game

Loud cries now arose of Down with the soldiers down with the vampire
He's in Bannerworth Hall Smoke him out And then one or two links were
hurled among the dismounted dragoons All this was put up with
patiently and then again the mob were implored to leave which being
answered by fresh taunts the magistrate proceeded to read the riot act
not one word of which was audible amid the tumult that prevailed

Put out all the lights cried a voice among the mob The order was
obeyed and the same voice added they dare not fire on us Come on
and a rush was made at the garden wall

Make ready present cried the officer And then he added in an under
tone above their heads now fire

There was a blaze of light for a moment a stunning noise a shout of
dismay from the mob and in another moment all was still

There said Dr Chillingworth that this is at all events a
bloodless victory

You may depend upon that said his companion but is not there some
one yet remaining Look there do you not see a figure clambering over
the fence

Yes I do indeed Ah they have him a prisoner at all events Those
two dragoons have him fast enough we shall now perhaps hear from
this fellow who is the actual ringleader in such an affair which but
for the pusillanimity of the mob might have turned out to be really
most disastrous

It was strange how one man should think it expedient to attack the
military post after the mob had been so completely routed at the first
discharge of fire-arms but so it was One man did make an attempt to
enter the garden and it was so rapid and so desperate an one that he
rather seemed to throw himself bodily at the fence which separated it
from the meadows without than to clamber over it as any one under
ordinary circumstances who might wish to effect an entrance by that
means would have done

He was no sooner however perceived than a couple of the dismounted
soldiers stepped forward and made a prisoner of him

Good God exclaimed Mr Chillingworth as they approached nearer with
him Good God what is the meaning of that Do my eyes deceive me or
are they indeed so blessed

Blessed by what exclaimed the hangman

By a sight of the long lost deeply regretted Charles Holland
Charles Charles is that indeed you or some unsubstantial form in your
likeness

Charles Holland for it was indeed himself heard the friendly voice
of the doctor and he called out to him

Speak to me of Flora Oh speak to me of Flora if you would not have
me die at once of suspense and all the torture of apprehension

She lives and is well

Thank Heaven Do with me what you please

Dr Chillingworth sprang forward and addressing the magistrate he
said 

Sir I know this gentleman He is no one of the rioters but a dear
friend of the family of the Bannerworths Charles Holland what in the
name of Heaven had become of you so long and what brought you here at
such a juncture as this

I am faint said Charles I I only arrived as the crowd did I had
not strength to fight my way through them and was compelled to pause
until they had dispersed Can can you give me water

Here's something better said one of the soldiers as he handed a
flask to Charles who partook of some of the contents which greatly
revived him indeed

I am better now he said Thank you kindly Take me into the house
Good God why is it made a point of attack Where are Flora and Henry
Are they all well And my uncle Oh what must you all have thought of
my absence But you cannot have endured a hundredth part of what I have
suffered Let me look once again upon the face of Flora Take me into
the house

Release him said the officer as he pointed to his head and looked
significantly as much as to say Some mad patient of yours I
suppose

You are much mistaken sir said Dr Chillingworth this gentleman
has been cruelly used I have no doubt He has I am inclined to
believe been made the victim for a time of the intrigues of that very
Sir Francis Varney whose conduct has been the real cause of all the
serious disturbances that have taken place in the country

Confound Sir Francis Varney muttered the officer he is enough to
set a whole nation by the ears However Mr Magistrate if you are
satisfied that this young man is not one of the rioters I have of
course no wish to hold him a prisoner

I can take Mr Chillingworth's word for more than that said the
magistrate

Charles Holland was accordingly released and then the doctor in
hurried accents told him the principal outlines of what had occurred

Oh take me to Flora he said let me not delay another moment in
seeking her and convincing her that I could not have been guilty of the
baseness of deserting her

Hark you Mr Holland I have quite made up my mind that I will not
leave Bannerworth Hall yet but you can go alone and easily find them
by the directions which I will give you only let me beg of you not to
go abruptly into the presence of Flora She is in an extremely delicate
state of health and although I do not take upon myself to say that a
shock of a pleasurable nature would prove of any paramount bad
consequence to her yet it is as well not to risk it

I will be most careful you may depend

At this moment there was a loud ringing at the garden bell and when it
was answered by one of the dragoons who was ordered to do so by his
officer he came back escorting no other than Jack Pringle who had
been sent by the admiral to the Hall but who had solaced himself so
much on the road with divers potations that he did not reach it till
now which was a full hour after the reasonable time in which he ought
to have gone the distance

Illustration

Jack was not to say dumb but he had had enough to give him a very jolly
sort of feeling of independence and so he came along quarrelling with
the soldier all the way the latter only laughing and keeping his temper
admirably well under a great deal of provocation

Why you land lubbers cried Jack what do you do here all of you I
wonder You are all wamphighers I'll be bound every one of you You
mind me of marines you do and that's quite enough to turn a proper
seaman's stomach any day in the week

The soldier only laughed and brought Jack up to the little group of
persons consisting of Dr Chillingworth the hangman Charles Holland
and the officer

Why Jack Pringle said Dr Chillingworth stepping before Charles so
that Jack should not see him why Jack Pringle what brings you
here

A slight squall sir to the nor'west Brought you something to eat

Jack produced a bottle

To drink you mean

Well it's all one only in this here shape you see it goes down
better I'm thinking which does make a little difference somehow

How is the admiral

Oh he's as stupid as ever Lord bless you he'd be like a ship without
a rudder without me and would go swaying about at the mercy of winds
and waves poor old man He's bad enough as it is but if so be I wasn't
to give the eye to him as I does bless my heart if I thinks as he'd be
above hatches long Here's to you all

Jack took the cork from the bottle he had with him and there came from
it a strong odour of rum Then he placed it to his lips and was
enjoying the pleasant gurgle of the liquor down his throat when Charles
stepped up to him and laying hold of the lower end of the bottle he
dragged it from his mouth saying 

How dare you talk in the way you have of my uncle you drunken
mutinous rascal and behind his back too

The voice of Charles Holland was as well known to Jack Pringle as that
of the admiral and his intense astonishment at hearing himself so
suddenly addressed by one of whose proximity he had not the least idea
made some of the rum go what is popularly termed the wrong way and
nearly choked him

He reeled back till he fell over some obstruction and then down he sat
on a flower bed while his eyes seemed ready to come out of his head

Avast heavings he cried Who's that

Come come said Charles Holland don't pretend you don't know me I
will not have my uncle spoken of in a disrespectful manner by you

Well shiver my timbers if that ain't our nevey Why Charley my boy
how are you Here we are in port at last Won't the old commodore pipe
his eye now Whew here's a go I've found our nevey after all

You found him said Dr Chillingworth now that is as great a piece
of impudence as ever I heard in all my life You mean that he has found
you and found you out too you drunken fellow Jack you get worse and
worse every day

Ay ay sir

What you admit it

Ay ay sir Now Master Charley I tell you what it is I shall take
you off to your old uncle you shore going sneak and you'll have to
report what cruise you've been upon all this while leaving the ship to
look after itself Lord love you all if it hadn't been for me I don't
know what anybody would have done

I only know of the result said Dr Chillingworth that would ensue
if it were not for you and that would consist in a great injury to the
revenue in consequence of the much less consumption of rum and other
strong liquors

I'll be hanged up at the yard if I understands what you mean said
Jack as if I ever drunk anything I of all people in the world I am
ashamed of you You are drunk

Several of the dragoons had to turn aside to keep themselves from
laughing and the officer himself could not forbear from a smile as he
said to the doctor 

Sir you seem to have many acquaintances and by some means or another
they all have an inclination to come here to-night If however you
consider that you are bound to remain here from a feeling that the Hall
is threatened with any danger you may dismiss that fear for I shall
leave a picquet here all night

No sir replied Dr Chillingworth it is not that I fear now after
the manner in which they have been repulsed any danger to the Hall from
the mob but I have reasons for wishing to be in it or near it for some
time to come

As you please

Charles do not wait for or accept the guidance of that drunken fellow
but go yourself with a direction which I will write down for you in a
leaf of my pocket-book

Drunken fellow exclaimed Jack who had now scrambled to his feet
who do you call a drunken fellow

Why you unquestionably

Well now that is hard Come along nevey I'll shew you where they
all are I could walk a plank on any deck with any man in the service I
could Come along my boy come along

You can accept of him as a guide if you like of course said the
doctor he may be sober enough to conduct you

I think he can said Charles Lead on Jack but mark me I shall
inform my uncle of this intemperance as well as of the manner in which
you let your tongue wag about him behind his back unless you promise to
reform

He is long past all reformation remarked Dr Chillingworth it is
out of the question

And I am afraid my uncle will not have courage to attempt such an
ungrateful task when there is so little chance of success replied
Charles Holland shaking the worthy doctor by the hand Farewell for
the present sir the next time I see you I hope we shall both be more
pleasantly situated

Come along nevey interrupted Jack Pringle now you've found your
way back the first thing you ought to do is to report yourself as
having come aboard Follow me and I'll soon show yer the port where the
old hulk's laid hisself up

Jack walked on first tolerably steady if one may take into account his
divers deep potations and Charles Holland anticipating with delight
again looking upon the face of his much loved Flora followed closely
behind him

We can well imagine the world of delightful thoughts that came crowding
upon him when Jack after rather a long walk announced that they were
now very near the residence of the object of his soul's adoration

We trust that there is not one of our readers who for one moment will
suppose that Charles Holland was the sort of man to leave even such a
villain and double-faced hypocrite as Marchdale to starve amid the
gloomy ruins where he was immured

Far from Charles's intentions was any such thing but he did think that
a night passed there with no other company than his own reflections
would do him a world of good and was at all events no very great
modicum of punishment for the rascality with which he had behaved

Besides even during that night there were refreshments in the shape of
bread and water such as had been presented to Charles himself within
Marchdale's reach as they had been within his

That individual now Charles thought would have a good opportunity of
testing the quality of that kind of food and of finding out what an
extremely light diet it was for a strong man to live upon

But in the morning it was Charles's intention to take Henry Bannerworth
and the admiral with him to the ruins and then and there release the
wretch from his confinement on condition that he made a full confession
of his villanies before those persons

Oh how gladly would Marchdale have exchanged the fate which actually
befell him for any amount of personal humiliation always provided that
it brought with it a commensurate amount of personal safety

But that fate was one altogether undreamt of by Charles Holland and
wholly without his control

It was a fate which would have been his but for the murderous purpose
which had brought Marchdale to the dungeon and those happy accidents
which had enabled Charles to change places with him and breathe the
free cool fresh air while he left his enemy loaded with the same
chains that had encumbered his limbs so cruelly and lying on that same
damp dungeon floor which he thought would be his grave

We mentioned that as Charles left the ruins the storm which had been
giving various indications of its coming seemed to be rapidly
approaching

It was one of these extremely local tempests which expend all their
principal fury over a small space of country and in this instance the
space seemed to include little more than the river and the few meadows
which immediately surrounded it and lent it so much of its beauty

Marchdale soon found that his cries were drowned by the louder voices of
the elements The wailing of the wind among the ancient ruins was much
more full of sound than his cries and now and then the full-mouthed
thunder filled the air with such a volume of roaring and awakened so
many echoes among the ruins that had he possessed the voices of fifty
men he could not have hoped to wage war with it

And then although we know that Charles Holland would have encountered
death himself rather than he would have willingly left anything human
to expire of hunger in that dungeon yet Marchdale judging of others by
himself felt by no means sure of any such thing and in his horror of
apprehension fancied that that was just the sort of easy and pleasant
and complete revenge that it was in Charles Holland's power to take and
just the one which would suggest itself under the circumstances to his
mind

Could anything be possibly more full of horror than such a thought
Death let it come in any shape it may is yet a most repulsive and
unwelcome guest but when it comes so united with all that can add to
its terrors it is enough to drive reason from its throne and fill the
mind with images of absolute horror

Tired of shrieking for his parched lips and clogged tongue would
scarcely now permit him to utter a sound higher than a whisper
Marchdale lay listening to the furious storm without in the last
abandonment of despair

Oh what a death is this he groaned Here alone all alone and
starvation to creep on me by degrees sapping life's energies one by
one Already do I feel the dreadful sickening weakness growing on me
Help oh help me Heav no no Dare I call on Heaven to help me Is
there no fiend of darkness who now will bid me a price for a human soul
Is there not one who will do so not one who will rescue me from the
horror that surrounds me for Heaven will not I dare not ask mercy
there

The storm continued louder and louder The wind it is true was nearly
hushed but the roar and the rattle of the echo-awakening thunder fully
made up for its cessation while now and then even there in that
underground abode some sudden reflection of the vivid lightning's light
would find its way lending for a fleeting moment sufficient light to
Marchdale wherewith he could see the gloomy place in which he was

At times he wept and at times he raved while ever and anon he made
such frantic efforts to free himself from the chains that were around
him that had they not been strong he must have succeeded but as it
was he only made deep indentations into his flesh and gave himself
much pain

Charles Holland he shouted oh release me Varney Varney why do
you not come to save me I have toiled for you most unrequitedly I have
not had my reward Let it all consist in my release from this dreadful
bondage Help help oh help

There was no one to hear him The storm continued and now suddenly a
sudden and a sharper sound than any awakened by the thunder's roar came
upon his startled ear and in increased agony he shouted 

What is that oh what is that God of heaven do my fears translate
that sound aright Can it be oh can it be that the ruins which have
stood for so many a year are now crumbling down before the storm of
to-night

The sound came again and he felt the walls of the dungeon in which he
was shake Now there could be no doubt but that the lightning had struck
some part of the building and so endangered the safety of all that was
above ground For a moment there came across his brain such a rush of
agony that he neither spoke nor moved Had that dreadful feeling
continued much longer he must have lapsed into insanity but that
amount of mercy for mercy it would have been was not shown to him He
still felt all the accumulating horrors of his situation and then with
such shrieks as nothing but a full appreciation of such horrors could
have given him strength to utter he called upon earth upon heaven and
upon all that was infernal to save him from his impending doom

All was in vain It was an impending doom which nothing but the direct
interposition of Heaven could have at all averted and it was not likely
that any such perversion of the regular laws of nature would take place
to save such a man as Marchdale

Again came the crashing sound of falling stones and he was certain that
the old ruins which had stood for so many hundred years the storm and
the utmost wrath of the elements was at length yielding and crumbling
down

What else could he expect but to be engulphed among the
fragments fragments still weighty and destructive although in decay
How fearfully now did his horrified imagination take in at one glance
as it were a panoramic view of all his past life and how absolutely
contemptible at that moment appeared all that he had been striving
for

But the walls shake again and this time the vibration is more fearful
than before There is a tremendous uproar above him the roof yields to
some superincumbent pressure there is one shriek and Marchdale lies
crushed beneath a mass of masonry that it would take men and machinery
days to remove from off him

All is over now That bold bad man that accomplished hypocrite that
mendacious would-be murderer was no more He lies but a mangled
crushed and festering corpse

May his soul find mercy with his God

The storm from this moment seemed to relax in its violence as if it
had accomplished a great purpose and consequently now need no longer
vex the air with its boisterous presence Gradually the thunder died
away in the distance The wind no longer blew in blustrous gusts but
with a gentle murmuring swept around the ancient pile as if singing
the requiem of the dead that lay beneath that dead which mortal eyes
were never to look upon




 LXXIV

THE MEETING OF CHARLES AND FLORA


Illustration

Charles Holland followed Jack Pringle for some time in silence from
Bannerworth Hall his mind was too full of thought concerning the past
to allow him to indulge in much of that kind of conversation in which
Jack Pringle might be fully considered to be a proficient

As for Jack somehow or another he had felt his dignity offended in the
garden of Bannerworth Hall and he had made up his mind as he
afterwards stated in his own phraseology not to speak to nobody till
somebody spoke to him

A growing anxiety however to ascertain from one who had seen her
lately how Flora had borne his absence at length induced Charles
Holland to break his self-imposed silence

Jack he said you have had the happiness of seeing her lately tell
me does Flora Bannerworth look as she was wont to look or have all the
roses faded from her cheeks

Why as for the roses said Jack I'm blowed if I can tell and
seeing as how she don't look at me much I doesn't know nothing about
her I can tell you something though about the old admiral that will
make you open your eyes

Indeed Jack and what may that be

Why he's took to drink and gets groggy about every day of his life
and the most singular thing is that when that's the case with the old
man he says it's me

Indeed Jack taken to drinking has my poor old uncle from grief I
suppose Jack at my disappearance

No I don't think it's grief said Jack it strikes me it's
rum-and-water

Alas alas I never could have imagined he could have fallen into that
habit of yours he always seemed so far from anything of this kind

Ay ay sir said Jack I know'd you'd be astonished It will be the
death of him that's my opinion and the idea you know Master Charles
of accusing me when he gets drunk himself

I believe that is a common delusion of intemperate persons said
Charles

Is it sir well it's a very awkward I thing because you know sir
as well as most people that I'm not the fellow to take a drop too
much

I cannot say Jack that I know so much for I have certainly heard my
uncle accuse you of intoxication

Lor sir that was all just on account of his trying it hisself he
was a thinking on it then and wanted to see how I'd take it

But tell me of Flora are you quite certain that she has had no more
alarms from Varney

What that ere vampire fellow not a bit of it your honour Lor bless
you he must have found out by some means or another that I was on the
look out and that did the business He'll never come near Miss Flora
again I'll be bound though to be sure we moved away from the Hall on
account of him but not that I saw the good of cruising out of one's own
latitude but somehow or another you see the doctor and the admiral got
it into their heads to establish a sort of blockade and the idea of the
thing was to sail away in the night quite quiet and after that take up
a position that would come across the enemy on the larboard tack if so
be as he made his appearance

Oh you allude to watching the Hall I presume

Ay ay sir just so but would you believe it Master Charlie the
admiral and the doctor got so blessed drunk that I could do nothing with
'em

Indeed

Yes they did indeed and made all kinds of queer mistakes so that the
end of all that was that the vampire did come but he got away again

He did come then Sir Francis Varney came again after the house was
presumed to be deserted

He did sir

That is very strange what on earth could have been his object This
affair is most inexplicably mysterious I hope the distance Jack is
not far that you're taking me for I'm incapable of enduring much
fatigue

Not a great way your honour keep two points to the westward and sail
straight on we'll soon come to port My eye won't there be a squall
when you get in I expect as Miss Flora will drop down as dead as a
herring for she doesn't think you're above the hatches

A good thought Jack my sudden appearance may produce alarm When we
reach the place of abode of the Bannerworths you shall precede me and
prepare them in some measure for my reception

Very good sir do you see that there little white cottage a-head
there in the offing

Yes yes is that the place

Yes your honour that's the port to which we are bound

Well then Jack you hasten a-head and see Miss Flora and be sure
you prepare her gently and by degrees you know Jack for my
appearance so that she shall not be alarmed

Ay ay sir I understand you wait here and I'll go and do it there
would be a squall if you were to make your appearance sir all at once
She looks upon you as safely lodged in Davy's locker she minds me all
the world of a girl I knew at Portsmouth called Bet Bumplush She was
one of your delicate little creatures as don't live long in this here
world no blow me when I came home from a eighteen months cruise
once I seed her drinking rum out of a quart pot so I says Hilloa
what cheer And only to think now of the wonderful effect that there
had upon her with that very pot she gives the fellow as was standing
treat a knobber on the head as lasted him three weeks She was too good
for this here world she was and too rummantic Go to blazes she
says to him here's Jack Pringle come home'

Very romantic indeed said Charles

Yes I believe you sir and that puts me in mind of Miss Flora and
you

An extremely flattering comparison Of course I feel much obliged

Oh don't name it sir The British tar as can't oblige a feller-cretor
is unworthy to tread the quarter-deck or to bear a hand to the distress
of a woman

Very well said Charles Now as we are here precede me if you
please and let me beg of you to be especially cautious in your manner
of announcing me

Ay ay sir said Jack and away he walked towards the cottage
leaving Charles some distance behind

Flora and the admiral were sitting together conversing The old man who
loved her as if she had been a child of his own was endeavouring to
the extent of his ability to assuage the anguish of her thoughts which
at that moment chanced to be bent upon Charles Holland

Nevermind my dear he said he'll turn up some of these days and
when he does I sha'n't forget to tell him that it was you who stood out
for his honesty and truth when every one else was against him
including myself an old wretch that I was

Oh sir how could you for one moment believe that those letters could
have been written by your nephew Charles They carried sir upon the
face of them their own refutation and I'm only surprised that for one
instant you or any one who knew him could have believed him capable of
writing them

Avast there said the admiral that'll do I own you got the better
of the old sailor there I think you and Jack Pringle were the only two
persons who stood out from the first

Then I honour Jack for doing so

And here he is said the admiral and you'd better tell him The
mutinous rascal he wants all the honour he can get as a set-off
against his drunkenness and other bad habits

Jack walked into the room looked about him in silence for a moment
thrust his hands in his breeches pockets and gave a long whistle

What's the matter now said the admiral

D me if Charles Holland ain't outside and I've come to prepare you
for the blessed shock said Jack Don't faint either of you because
I'm only going to let you know it by degrees you know

A shriek burst from Flora's lips and she sprung to the door of the
apartment

What cried the admiral my nephew my nephew Charles Jack you
rascal if you're joking it's the last joke you shall make in this
world and if it's true I I I'm an old fool that's all

Ay ay sir said Jack didn't you know that afore

Charles Charles cried Flora He heard the voice Her name escaped
his lips and rang with a pleasant echo through the house

In another moment he was in the room and had clasped her to his breast

My own my beautiful my true

Charles dear Charles

Oh Flora what have I not endured since last we met but this repays
me more than repays me for all

What is the past now cried Flora what are all its miseries placed
against this happy happy moment

D me nobody thinks of me said the admiral

My dear uncle said Charles looking over Flora's shoulder as he
still held her in his arms is that you

Yes yes swab it is me and you know it but give us your five you
mutinous vagabond and I tell you what I'll do you the greatest favour
I've had an opportunity of doing you some time I'll leave you alone
you dog Come along Jack

Ay ay sir said Jack and away they went out of the apartment

And now those two loving hearts were alone they who had been so long
separated by malignant destiny once again were heart to heart looking
into each other's faces with all the beaming tenderness of an affection
of the truest holiest character

The admiral had done a favour to them both to leave them alone although
we much doubt whether his presence or the presence of the whole world
would have had the effect of controlling one generous sentiment of noble
feeling

They would have forgotten everything but that they were together and
that once again each looked into the other's eyes with all the
tenderness of a love purer and higher than ordinarily belongs to mortal
affections

Language was weak to give utterance to the full gust of happy feelings
that now were theirs It was ecstasy enough to feel to know that the
evil fortune which had so long separated them depriving each existence
of its sunniest aspect was over It was enough for Charles Holland to
feel that she loved him still It was enough for Flora Bannerworth to
know as she looked into his beaming countenance that that love was not
misplaced but was met by feelings such as she herself would have
dictated to be the inhabitants of the heart of him whom she would have
chosen from the mass of mankind as her own

Flora dear Flora said Charles and you have never doubted me

I've never doubted Charles Heaven or you To doubt one would have
been to doubt both

Generous and best of girls what must you have thought of my enforced
absence Oh Flora I was unjust enough to your truth to make my
greatest pang the thought that you might doubt me and cast me from your
heart for ever

Ah Charles you ought to have known me better I stood amid sore
temptation to do so much There were those who would have urged me on to
think that you had cast me from your heart for ever There were those
ready and willing to place the worst construction upon your conduct and
with a devilish ingenuity to strive to make me participate in such a
feeling but no Charles no I loved you and I trusted you and I
could not so far belie my own judgment as to tell you other than what
you always seemed to my young fancy

And you are right my Flora right and is it not a glorious triumph to
see that love that sentiment of passion has enabled you to have so
enduring and so noble a confidence in aught human

Ay Charles it is the sentiment of passion for our love has been more
a sentiment than a passion I would fain think that we had loved each
other with an affection not usually known appreciated or understood
and so in the vanity of my best affections I would strive to think
them something exclusive and beyond the common feelings of humanity

And you are right my Flora such love as yours is the exception there
may be preferences there may be passions and there may be sentiments
but never never surely was there a heart like yours

Nay Charles now you speak from a too poetical fancy but is it
possible that I have had you here so long with your hand clasped in
mine and asked you not the causes of your absence

Oh Flora I have suffered much much physically but more mentally It
was the thought of you that was at once the bane and the antidote of my
existence

Indeed Charles Did I present myself in such contradictory colours to
you

Yes dearest as thus When I thought of you sometimes in the deep
seclusion of a dungeon that thought almost goaded me to madness
because it brought with it the conviction a conviction peculiar to a
lover that none could so effectually stand between you and all evil as
myself

Yes yes Charles most true

It seemed to me as if all the world in arms could not have protected
you so well as this one heart clad in the triple steel of its
affections could have shielded you from evil

Ay Charles and then I was the bane of your existence because I
filled you with apprehension

For a time dearest and then came the antidote for when exhausted
alike in mind and body when lying helpless with chains upon my
limbs when expecting death at every visit of those who had dragged me
from light and from liberty and from love it was but the thought of
thy beauty and thy affection that nerved me and gave me a hope even
amidst the cruellest disaster

And then and then Charles

You were my blessing as you have ever been as you are and as you
will ever be my own Flora my beautiful my true

We won't go so far as to say it is the fact but from a series of
singular sounds which reached even to the passage of the cottage we
have our own private opinion to the effect that Charles began kissing
Flora at the top of her forehead and never stopped somehow or another
till he got down to her chin no not her chin her sweet lips he could
not get past them Perhaps it was wrong but we can't help it we are
faithful chroniclers Reader if you be of the sterner sex what would
you have done if of the gentler what would you have permitted

MUTUAL EXPLANATIONS AND THE VISIT TO THE RUINS


Illustration

During the next hour Charles informed Flora of the whole particulars of
his forcible abduction and to his surprise he heard of course for the
first time of those letters purporting to be written by him which
endeavoured to give so bad an aspect to the fact of his sudden
disappearance from Bannerworth Hall

Flora would insist upon the admiral Henry and the rest of the family
hearing all that Charles had to relate concerning Mr Marchdale for
well she knew that her mother from early associations was so far
impressed in the favour of that hypocritical personage that nothing but
damning facts much to his prejudice would suffice to convince her of
the character he really was

But she was open to conviction and when she really found what a villain
she had cherished and given her confidence to she shed abundance of
tears and blamed herself exceedingly as the cause of some of the
misfortunes which had fallen upon her children

Very good said the admiral I ain't surprised a bit I knew he was a
vagabond from the first time I clapped eyes upon him There was a down
look about the fellow's figure-head that I didn't like and be hanged to
him but I never thought he would have gone the length he has done And
so you say you've got him safe in the ruins Charles

I have indeed uncle

And then there let him remain and a good place too for him

No uncle no I'm sure you speak without thought I intend to release
him in a few hours when I have rested from my fatigues He could not
come to any harm if he were to go without food entirely for the time
that I leave him but even that he will not do for there is bread and
water in the dungeon

Bread and water that's too good for him But however Charles when
you go to let him out I'll go with you just to tell him what I think
of him the vagabond

He must suffer amazingly for no doubt knowing well as he does his
own infamous intentions he will consider that if I were to leave him to
starve to death I should be but retailing upon him the injuries he
would have inflicted upon me

The worst of it is said the admiral I can't think what to do with
him

Do nothing uncle but just let him go it will be a sufficient
punishment for such a man to feel that instead of succeeding in his
designs he has only brought upon himself the bitterest contempt of
those whom he would fain have injured I can have no desire for revenge
on such a man as Marchdale

You are right Charles said Flora let him go and let him go with a
feeling that he has acquired the contempt of those whose best opinions
might have been his for a far less amount of trouble than he has taken
to acquire their worst

Excitement had kept up Charles to this point but now when he arose and
expressed his intention of going to the ruins for the purpose of
releasing Marchdale he exhibited such unequivocal symptoms of
exhaustion and fatigue that neither his uncle nor Flora would permit him
to go so in deference to them he gave up the point and commissioned
the admiral and Jack with Henry to proceed to the place and give the
villain his freedom little suspecting what had occurred since he had
himself left the neighbourhood of those ruins

Of course Charles Holland couldn't be at all accountable for the work of
the elements and it was not for him to imagine that when he left
Marchdale in the dungeon that so awful a catastrophe as that we have
recorded to the reader was to ensue

The distance to the ruins was not so great from this cottage even as it
was from Bannerworth Hall provided those who went knew the most direct
and best road to take so that the admiral was not gone above a couple
of hours and when he returned he sat down and looked at Charles with
such a peculiar expression that the latter could not for the life of
him tell what to make of it

Illustration

Something has happened uncle he said I am certain tell me at once
what it is

Oh nothing nothing said the admiral of any importance

Is that what you call your feelings said Jack Pringle Can't you
tell him as there came on a squall last night and the ruins have come
in with a dab upon old Marchdale crushing his guts so that we smelt
him as soon as we got nigh at hand

Good God said Charles has such a catastrophe occurred

Yes Charles that's just about the catastrophe that has occurred He's
dead and rum enough it is that it should happen on the very night that
you escaped

Rum said Jack suddenly my eye who mentions rum What a singular
sort of liquor rum must be I heard of a chap as used to be fond of it
once on board a ship I wonder if there's any in the house

No said the admiral but there's a fine pump of spring water outside
if you feel a little thirsty Jack and I'll engage it shall do you more
good than all the rum in the world

Uncle said Charles I'm glad to hear you make that observation

What for

Why to deal candidly with you uncle Jack informed me that you had
lately taken quite a predilection for drinking

Me cried the admiral why the infernal rascal I've had to threaten
him with his discharge a dozen times at least on that very ground and
no other

There's somebody calling me said Jack I'm a coming I'm a coming
and so he bolted out of the room just in time to escape an inkstand
which the admiral caught up and flung after him

I'll strike that rascal off the ship's books this very day muttered
Admiral Bell The drunken vagabond to pretend that I take anything
when all the while it's himself

Well well I ought certainly to have suspected the quarter from whence
the intelligence came but he told it to me so circumstantially and
with such an apparent feeling of regret for the weakness into which he
said you had fallen that I really thought there might be some truth in
it

The rascal I've done with him from this moment I have put up with too
much from him for years past

I think now that you have given him a great deal of liberty and that
with a great deal more he has taken makes up an amount which you find
it difficult to endure

And I won't endure it

Let me talk to him and I dare say I shall be able to convince him that
he goes too far and when he finds that such is the case he will mend

Speak to him if you like but I have done with such a mutinous rascal
I have You can take him into your service if you like till you get
tired of him and that won't be very long

Well well we shall see Jack will apologise to you I have no doubt
and then I shall intercede for him and advise you to give him another
trial

If you get him into the apology then there's no doubt about me giving
him another trial But I know him too well for that he's as obstinate
as a mule he is and you won't get a civil word out of him but never
mind that now I tell you what Master Charley it will take a good lot
of roast beef to get up your good looks again

It will indeed uncle and I require now rest for I am thoroughly
exhausted The great privations I have undergone and the amount of
mental excitement which I have experienced in consequence of the sudden
and unexpected release from a fearful confinement have greatly weakened
all my energies A few hours sleep will make quite a different being of
me

Well my boy you know best returned the admiral and I'll take
care if you sleep till to-morrow that you sha'n't be disturbed So now
be off to bed at once

The young man shook his uncle's hand in a cordial manner and then
repaired to the apartment which had been provided for him

Charles Holland did indeed stand in need of repose and for the first
time now for many days he laid down with serenity at his heart and
slept for many hours And was there not now a great and a happy change
in Flora Bannerworth As if by magic in a few short hours much of the
bloom of her before-fading beauty returned to her Her step again
recovered its springy lightness again she smiled upon her mother and
suffered herself to talk of a happy future for the dread even of the
vampire's visitations had faded into comparative insignificance against
the heart's deep dejection which had come over her at the thought that
Charles Holland must surely be murdered or he would have contrived to
come to her

And what a glorious recompense she had now for the trusting confidence
with which she had clung to a conviction of his truth Was it not great
now to feel that when he was condemned by others and when strong and
unimpeachable evidence seemed to be against him she had clung to him
and declared her faith in his honour and wept for him instead of
condemning

Yes Flora you were of that order of noble minds that where once
confidence is given give it fully and completely and will not harbour
a suspicion of the faith of the loved one a happy disposition when
verified as in this instance by an answering truthfulness

But when such a heart trusts not with judgment when that pure exalted
and noble confidence is given to an object unworthy of it then comes
indeed the most fearful of all mental struggles and if the fond heart
that has hugged to its inmost core so worthless a treasure do not break
in the effort to discard it we may well be surprised at the amount of
fortitude that has endured so much

Although the admiral had said but little concerning the fearful end
Marchdale had come to it really did make some impression upon him and
much as he held in abhorrence the villany of Marchdale's conduct he
would gladly in his heart have averted the fate from him that he had
brought upon himself

On the road to the ruins he calculated upon taking a different kind of
vengeance

When they had got some distance from the cottage Admiral Bell made a
proposal to Henry to be his second while he fought Marchdale but Henry
would not hear of it for a moment

My dear sir he said could I do you think stand by and see a
valuable revered and a respected life like yours exposed to any hazard
merely upon the chance of punishing a villain No no Marchdale is too
base now to be met in honourable encounter If he is dealt with in any
way let it be by the laws

This was reasonable enough and after some argument the admiral
coincided in it and then they began to wonder how without Charles
they should be able to get an entrance to the dungeons for it had been
his intention originally had he not felt so fatigued to go with them

As soon however as they got tolerably near to the ruins they saw what
had happened Neither spoke but they quickened their pace and soon
stood close to the mass of stone-work which now had assumed so different
a shape to what it had a few short hours before

It needed little examination to let them feel certain that whoever might
have been in any of the underground dungeons must have been crushed to
death

Heaven have mercy upon his soul said Henry

Amen said the admiral

They both turned away and for some time they neither of them spoke for
their thoughts were full of reflection upon the horrible death which
Marchdale must have endured At length the admiral said 

Shall we tell this or not

Tell it at once said Henry let us have no secrets

Good Then I will not make one you may depend I only wish that while
he was about it Charley could have popped that rascal Varney as well in
the dungeon and then there would have been an end and a good riddance
of them both

THE SECOND NIGHT-WATCH OF MR CHILLINGWORTH AT THE HALL


Illustration

The military party in the morning left Bannerworth Hall and the old
place resumed its wonted quiet But Dr Chillingworth found it difficult
to get rid of his old friend the hangman who seemed quite disposed to
share his watch with him

The doctor without being at all accused of being a prejudiced man
might well object to the continued companionship of one who according
to his own account was decidedly no better than he should be if he
were half so good

Moreover it materially interfered with the proceedings of our medical
friend whose object was to watch the vampire with all imaginable
quietness and secrecy in the event of his again visiting Bannerworth
Hall

Sir he said to the hangman now that you have so obligingly related
to me your melancholy history I will not detain you

Oh you are not detaining me

Yes but I shall probably remain here for a considerable time

I have nothing to do and one place is about the same as another to
me

Well then if I must speak plainly allow me to say that as I came
here upon a very important and special errand I desire most
particularly to be left alone Do you understand me now

Oh ah I understand you want me to go

Just so

Well then Dr Chillingworth allow me to tell you I have come here
on a very special errand likewise

You have

I have I have been putting one circumstance to another and drawing a
variety of conclusions from a variety of facts so that I have come to
what I consider an important resolve namely to have a good look at
Bannerworth Hall and if I continue to like it as well as I do now I
should like to make the Bannerworth family an offer for the purchase of
it

The devil you would Why all the world seems mad upon the project of
buying this old building which really is getting into such a state of
dilapidation that it cannot last many years longer

It is my fancy

No no there is something more in this than meets the eye The same
reason be it what may that has induced Varney the vampire to become so
desirous of possessing the Hall actuates you

Possibly

And what is that reason You may as well be candid with me

Yes I will and am I like the picturesque aspect of the place

No you know that that is a disingenuous answer that you know well It
is not the aspect of the old Hall that has charms for you But I feel
only from your conduct more than ever convinced that some plot is
going on having the accomplishment of some great object as its climax
a something of which you have guessed

How much you are mistaken

No I am certain I am right and I shall immediately advise the
Bannerworth family to return and to take up their abode again here in
order to put an end to the hopes which you or Varney or any one else
may have of getting possession of the place

If you were a man said the hangman who cared a little more for
yourself and a little less for others I would make a confidant of
you

What do you mean

Why I mean candidly that you are not selfish enough to be entitled
to my confidence

That is a strange reason for withholding confidence from any man

It is a strange reason but in this case a most abundantly true one
I cannot tell you what I would tell you because I cannot make the
agreement with you that I would fain make

You talk in riddles

To explain which then would be to tell my secret

Dr Chillingworth was evidently much annoyed and yet he was in an
extremely helpless condition for as to forcing the hangman to leave the
Hall if he did not feel disposed to do so that was completely out of
the question and could not be done In the first place he was a much
more powerful man than the doctor and in the second it was quite
contrary to all Mr Chillingworth's habits to engage in anything like
personal warfare

He could only therefore look his vexation and say 

If you are determined upon remaining I cannot help it but when some
one as there assuredly will comes from the Bannerworths here to me
or I shall be under the necessity of stating candidly that you are
intruding

Very good As the morning air is keen and as we now are not likely to
be as good company to each other as we were I shall go inside the
house

This was a proposition which the doctor did not like but he was
compelled to submit to it and he saw with feelings of uneasiness the
hangman make his way into the Hall by one of the windows

Then Dr Chillingworth sat down to think Much he wondered what could be
the secret of the great desire which Varney Marchdale and even this
man had all of them to be possessors of the old Hall

That there was some powerful incentive he felt convinced and he longed
for some conversation with the Bannerworths or with Admiral Bell in
order that he might state what had now taken place That some one would
soon come to him in order to bring fresh provisions for the day he was
certain and all he could do in the interim was to listen to what the
hangman was about in the Hall

Not a sound for a considerable time disturbed the intense stillness of
the place but now suddenly Mr Chillingworth thought he heard a
hammering as if some one was at work in one of the rooms of the Hall

What can be the meaning of that he said and he was about to proceed
at once to the interior of the building through the same window which
had enabled the hangman to gain admittance when he heard his own name
pronounced by some one at the back of the garden fence and upon casting
his eyes in that direction he to his great relief saw the admiral and
Henry Bannerworth

Come round to the gate said the doctor I am more glad to see you
than I can tell you just now Do not make more noise than you can help
but come round to the gate at once

They obeyed the injunction with alacrity and when the doctor had
admitted them the admiral said eagerly 

You don't mean to tell us that he is here

No no not Varney but he is not the only one who has taken a great
affection for Bannerworth Hall you may have another tenant for it and
I believe at any price you like to name

Indeed

Hush creep along close to the house and then you will not be seen
There do you hear that noise in the hall

Why it sounds said the admiral like the ship's carpenter at work

It does indeed sound like a carpenter it's only the new tenant
making I dare say some repairs

D n his impudence

Why it certainly does look like a very cool proceeding I must admit

Who and what is he

Who he is now I cannot tell you but he was once the hangman of
London at a time when I was practising in the metropolis and so I
became acquainted with him He knows Sir Francis Varney and if I
mistake not has found out the cause of that mysterious personage's
great attachment to Bannerworth Hall and has found the reasons so
cogent that he has got up an affection for it himself

To me said Henry all this is as incomprehensible as anything can
possibly be What on earth does it all mean

My dear Henry said the doctor will you be ruled by me

I will be ruled by any one whom I know I can trust for I am like a man
groping his way in the dark

Then allow this gentleman who is carpentering away so pleasantly within
the house to do so to his heart's content but don't let him leave it
Show yourselves now in the garden he has sufficient prudence to know
that three constitute rather fearful odds against one and so he will be
careful and remain where he is If he should come out we need not let
him go until we thoroughly ascertain what he has been about

You shall command the squadron doctor said the admiral and have it
all your own way you know so here goes Come along Henry and let's
show ourselves we are both armed too

They walked out into the centre of the garden and they were soon
convinced that the hangman saw them for a face appeared at the window
and was as quickly withdrawn again

There said the doctor now he knows he is a prisoner and we may as
well place ourselves in some position which commands a good view of the
house as well as of the garden gate and so see if we cannot starve him
out though we may be starved out ourselves

Not at all said Admiral Bell producing from his ample pockets
various parcels we came to bring you ample supplies

Indeed

Yes we have been as far as the ruins

Oh to release Marchdale Charles told me how the villain had fallen
into the trap he had laid for him

He has indeed fallen into the trap and it's one he won't easily get
out of again He's dead

Dead dead

Yes in the storm of last night the ruins have fallen and he is by
this time as flat as a pancake

Good God and yet it is but a just retribution upon him He would have
assassinated poor Charles Holland in the cruelest and most cold-blooded
manner and however we may shudder at the manner of his death we
cannot regret it

Except that he has escaped your friend the hangman said the admiral

Don't call him my friend if you please said Dr Chillingworth but
hark how he is working away as if he really intended to carry the house
away piece by piece as opportunity may serve if you will not let it to
him altogether just as it stands

Confound him he is evidently working on his own account said the
admiral or he would not be half so industrious

There was indeed a tremendous amount of hammering and noise of one
sort and another from the house and it was quite clear that the
hangman was too heart and soul in his work whatever may have been the
object of it to care who was listening to him or to what conjecture he
gave rise

He thought probably that he could but he stopped in what he was about
and until he was so that he might as well go on

And on he went with a vengeance vexing the admiral terribly who
proposed so repeatedly to go into the house and insist upon knowing what
he was about that his wishes were upon the point of being conceded to
by Henry although they were combatted by the doctor when from the
window at which he had entered out stepped the hangman

Good morning gentlemen good morning he said and he moved towards
the garden gate I will not trouble you any longer Good morning

Not so fast said the admiral or we may bring you up with a round
turn and I never miss my mark when I can see it and I shall not let it
get out of sight you may depend

He drew a pistol from his pocket as he spoke and pointed it at the
hangman who thereupon paused and said 

What am I not to be permitted to go in peace Why it was but a short
time since the doctor was quarrelling with me because I did not go and
now it seems that I am to be shot if I do

Yes said the admiral that's it

Well but 

You dare said he stir another inch towards the gate and you are a
dead man

The hangman hesitated a moment and looked at Admiral Bell apparently
the result of the scrutiny was that he would keep his word for he
suddenly turned and dived in at the window again without saying another
word

Well you have certainly stopped him from leaving said Henry but
what's to be done now

Let him be let him be said the doctor he must come out again for
there are no provisions in the place and he will be starved out

Hush what is that said Henry

There was a very gentle ring at the bell which hung over the garden
gate

That's an experiment now I'll be bound said the doctor to
ascertain if any one is here let us hide ourselves and take no
notice

The ring in a few moments was repeated and the three confederates hid
themselves effectually behind some thick laurel bushes and awaited with
expectation what might next ensue

Not long had they occupied their place of concealment before they heard
a heavy fall upon the gravelled pathway immediately within the gate as
if some one had clambered to the top from the outside and then jumped
down

That this was the case the sound of footsteps soon convinced them and
to their surprise as well as satisfaction they saw through the
interstices of the laurel bush behind which they were concealed no less
a personage that Sir Francis Varney himself

It is Varney said Henry

Yes yes whispered the doctor Let him be do not move for any
consideration for the first time let him do just what he likes

D n the fellow said the admiral there are some points about him
that like after all and he's quite an angel compared to that rascal
Marchdale

He is he saved Charles

He did and not if I know it shall any harm come to him unless he were
terribly to provoke it by becoming himself the assailant

How sad he looks

Hush he comes nearer it is not safe to talk Look at him

VARNEY IN THE GARDEN THE COMMUNICATION OF DR CHILLINGWORTH TO THE
ADMIRAL AND HENRY


Illustration

Kind reader it was indeed Varney who had clambered over the garden
wall and thus made his way into the garden of Bannerworth Hall and
what filled those who looked at him with the most surprise was that he
did not seem in any particular way to make a secret of his presence but
walked on with an air of boldness which either arose from a feeling of
absolute impunity from his thinking there was no one there or from an
audacity which none but he could have compassed

As for the little party that was there assembled and who looked upon
him they seemed thunderstricken by his presence and Henry probably
as well as the admiral would have burst out into some sudden
exclamation had they not been restrained by Dr Chillingworth who
suspecting that they might in some way give an alarm hastened to speak
first saying in a whisper 

For Heaven's sake be still fortune you see favours us most
strangely Leave Varney alone You have no other mode whatever of
discovering what he really wants at Bannerworth Hall

I am glad you have spoken said Henry as he drew a long breath If
you had not I feel convinced that in another moment I should have
rushed forward and confronted this man who has been the very bane of my
life

And so should I said the admiral although I protest against any
harm being done to him on account of some sort of good feeling that he
has displayed after all in releasing Charles from that dungeon in
which Marchdale has perished

At the moment said Henry I had forgotten that but I will own that
his conduct has been tinctured by a strange and wild kind of generosity
at times which would seem to bespeak at the bottom of his heart some
good feelings the impulses of which were only quenched by
circumstances

That is my firm impression of him I can assure you said Dr
Chillingworth

They watched Varney now from the leafy covert in which they were
situated and indeed had they been less effectually concealed it did
not seem likely that the much dreaded vampire would have perceived them
for not only did he make no effort at concealment himself but he took
no pains to see if any one was watching him in his progress to the
house

His footsteps were more rapid than they usually were and there was
altogether an air and manner about him as if he were moved to some
purpose which of itself was sufficiently important to submerge in its
consequences all ordinary risks and all ordinary cautions

He tried several windows of the house along that terrace of which we
have more than once had occasion to speak before he found one that
opened but at length he did succeed and stepped at once into the Hall
leaving those who now for some moments in silence had regarded his
movements to lose themselves in a fearful sea of conjecture as to what
could possibly be his object

At all events said the admiral I'm glad we are here If the vampire
should have a fight with that other fellow that we heard doing such a
lot of carpentering work in the house we ought I think to see fair
play

I for one said the doctor would not like to stand by and see the
vampire murdered but I am inclined to think he is a good match for any
mortal opponent

You may depend he is said Henry

But how long doctor do you purpose that we should wait here in such a
state of suspense as to what is going on within the house

I hope not long but that something will occur to make us have food for
action Hark what is that

There was a loud crash within the building as of broken glass It
sounded as if some window had been completely dashed in but although
they looked carefully over the front of the building they could see no
evidences of such a thing having happened and were compelled
consequently to come to the opinion that Varney and the other man must
have met in one of the back rooms and that the crash of glass had
arisen from some personal conflict in which they had engaged

I cannot stand this said Henry

Nay nay said the doctor be still and I will tell you something
than which there can be no more fitting time than this to reveal it

Refers it to the vampire

It does it does

Be brief then I am in an agony of impatience

It is a circumstance concerning which I can be brief for horrible as
it is I have no wish to dress it in any adventitious colours Sir
Francis Varney although under another name is an old acquaintance of
mine

Acquaintance said Henry

Why you don't mean to say you are a vampire said the admiral or
that he has ever visited you

No but I knew him From the first moment that I looked upon him in
this neighbourhood I thought I knew him but the circumstance which
induced me to think so was of so terrific a character that I made some
efforts to chase it from my mind It has however grown upon me day by
day and lately I have had proof sufficient to convince me of his
identity with one whom I first saw under most singular circumstances of
romance

Say on you are agitated

I am indeed This revelation has several times within the last few
days trembled on my lips but now you shall have it because you ought
to know all that it is possible for me to tell you of him who has caused
you so serious an amount of disturbance

You awaken doctor said Henry all my interest

And mine too remarked the admiral What can it be all about and
where doctor did you first see this Varney the vampire

In his coffin

Both the admiral and Henry gave starts of surprise as with one accord
they exclaimed 

Did you say coffin

Yes I tell you on my word of honour that the first time in my life I
saw ever Sir Francis Varney was in his coffin

Then he is a vampire and there can be no mistake said the admiral

Go on I pray you doctor go on said Henry anxiously

I will The reason why he became the inhabitant of a coffin was simply
this he had been hanged executed at the Old Bailey in London
before ever I set eyes upon that strange countenance of his You know
that I was practising surgery at the London schools some years ago and
that consequently as I commenced the profession rather late in life I
was extremely anxious to do the most I could in a very short space of
time

Yes yes

Arrived then with plenty of resources which I did not as the young
men who affected to be studying in the same classes as myself spend in
the pursuit of what they considered life in London I was
indefatigable in my professional labours and there was nothing
connected with them which I did not try to accomplish

At that period the difficulty of getting a subject for anatomization
was very great and all sorts of schemes had to be put into requisition
to accomplish so desirable and indeed absolutely necessary a purpose

I became acquainted with the man who I have told you is in the Hall
at present and who then filled the unenviable post of public
executioner It so happened too that I had read a learned treatise by
a Frenchman who had made a vast number of experiments with galvanic and
other apparatus upon persons who had come to death in different ways
and in one case he asserted that he had actually recovered a man who
had been hanged and he had lived five weeks afterwards

Young as I then was in comparison to what I am now in my profession
this inflamed my imagination and nothing seemed to me so desirable as
getting hold of some one who had only recently been put to death for
the purpose of trying what I could do in the way of attempting a
resuscitation of the subject It was precisely for this reason that I
sought out the public executioner and made his acquaintance whom every
one else shunned because I thought he might assist me by handing over
to me the body of some condemned and executed man upon whom I could try
my skill

I broached the subject to him and found him not averse He said that
if I would come forward and claim as next of kin and allow the body to
be removed to his house the body of the criminal who was to be executed
the first time from that period that he could give me a hint that I
should have no real next of kin opponents he would throw every facility
in my way

This was just what I wanted and I believe I waited with impatience
for some poor wretch to be hurried to his last account by the hands of
my friend the public executioner

At length a circumstance occurred which favoured my designs most
effectually A man was apprehended for a highway robbery of a most
aggravated character He was tried and the evidence against him was so
conclusive that the defence which was attempted by his counsel became
a mere matter of form

He was convicted and sentenced The judge told him not to flatter
himself with the least notion that mercy would be extended to him The
crime of which he had been found guilty was on the increase it was
highly necessary to make some great public example to show evil doers
that they could not with impunity thus trample upon the liberty of the
subject and had suddenly just as it were in the very nick of time
committed the very crime attended with all the aggravated circumstances
which made it easy and desirable to hang him out of hand

He heard his sentence they tell me unmoved I did not see him but he
was represented to me as a man of a strong and well-knit frame with
rather a strange but what some would have considered a handsome
expression of countenance inasmuch as that there was an expression of
much haughty resolution depicted on it

I flew to my friend the executioner

'Can you I said get me that man's body who is to be hanged for the
highway robbery on Monday'

'Yes he said I see nothing to prevent it Not one soul has offered
to claim even common companionship with him far less kindred I think
if you put in your claim as a cousin who will bear the expense of his
decent burial you will have every chance of getting possession of the
body'

I did not hesitate but on the morning before the execution I called
upon one of the sheriffs

I told him that the condemned man I regretted to say was related to
me but as I knew nothing could be done to save him on the trial I had
abstained from coming forward but that as I did not like the idea of
his being rudely interred by the authorities I had come forward to ask
for the body after the execution should have taken place in order that
I might at all events bestow upon it in some sequestered spot a
decent burial with all the rites of the church

The sheriff was a man not overburthened with penetration He applauded
my pious feelings and actually gave me without any inquiry a written
order to receive the body from the hands of the hangman after it had
hung the hour prescribed by the law

I did not as you may well suppose wish to appear more in the business
than was absolutely necessary but I gave the executioner the sheriff's
order for the body and he promised that he would get a shell ready to
place it in and four stout men to carry it at once to his house when
he should cut it down

'Good I said and now as I am not a little anxious for the success
of my experiment do you not think that you can manage so that the fall
of the criminal shall not be so sudden as to break his neck'

'I have thought of that he said and I believe that I can manage to
let him down gently so that he shall die of suffocation instead of
having his neck put out of joint I will do my best

'If you can but succeed in that said I for I was quite in a state of
mania upon the subject I shall be much indebted to you and will
double the amount of money which I have already promised'

This was as I believed it would be a powerful stimulus to him to do
all in his power to meet my wishes and he took no doubt active
measures to accomplish all that I desired

You can imagine with what intense impatience I waited the result He
resided in an old ruinous looking house a short distance on the Surrey
side of the river and there I had arranged all my apparatus for making
experiments upon the dead man in an apartment the windows of which
commanded a view of the entrance

Illustration

I was completely ready by half-past eight although a moment's
consideration of course told me that at least another hour must elapse
before there could be the least chance of my seeing him arrive for whom
I so anxiously longed

I can safely say so infatuated was I upon the subject that no fond
lover ever looked with more nervous anxiety for the arrival of the
chosen object of his heart than I did for that dead body upon which I
proposed to exert all the influences of professional skill to recall
back the soul to its earthly dwelling-place

At length I heard the sound of wheels I found that my friend the
hangman had procured a cart in which he brought the coffin that being
a much quicker mode of conveyance than by bearers so that about a
quarter past nine o'clock the vehicle with its ghastly content stopped
at the door of his house

In my impatience I ran down stairs to meet that which ninety-nine men
out of a hundred would have gone some distance to avoid the sight of
namely a corpse livid and fresh from the gallows I however heralded
it as a great gift and already in imagination I saw myself imitating
the learned Frenchman who had published such an elaborate treatise on
the mode of restoring life under all sorts of circumstances to those
who were already pronounced by unscientific persons to be dead

To be sure a sort of feeling had come over me at times knowing as I
did that the French are a nation that do not scruple at all to sacrifice
truth on the altar of vanity that it might be after all a mere
rhodomontade but however I could only ascertain so much by actually
trying so the suspicion that such might by a possibility be the end
of the adventure did not deter me

I officiously assisted in having the coffin brought into the room where
I had prepared everything that was necessary in the conduction of my
grand experiment and then when no one was there with me but my friend
the executioner I with his help the one of us taking the head and the
other the feet took the body from the coffin and laid it upon a table

Hastily I placed my hand upon the region of the heart and to my great
delight I found it still warm I drew off the cap that covered the face
and then for the first time my eyes rested upon the countenance of him
who now calls himself Heaven only knows why Sir Francis Varney

Good God said Henry are you certain

Quite

It may have been some other rascal like him said the admiral

No I am quite sure now I have as I have before mentioned to you
tried to get out of my own conviction upon the subject but I have been
actually assured that he is the man by the very hangman himself

Go on go on Your tale certainly is a strange one and I do not say it
either to compliment you or to cast a doubt upon you but except from
the lips of an old and valued friend such as you yourself are I
should not believe it'

I am not surprised to hear you say that replied the doctor nor
should I be offended even now if you were to entertain a belief that I
might after all be mistaken

No no you would not be so positive upon the subject I well know if
there was the slightest possibility of an error

Indeed I should not

Let us have the sequel then

It is this I was most anxious to effect an immediate resuscitation if
it were possible of the hanged man A little manipulation soon
convinced me that the neck was not broken which left me at once every
thing to hope for The hangman was more prudent than I was and before I
commenced my experiments he said 

'Doctor have you duly considered what you mean to do with this fellow
in case you should be successful in restoring him to life'

'Not I said I

'Well he said you can do as you like but I consider that it is
really worth thinking of'

I was headstrong on the matter and could think of nothing but the
success or the non-success in a physiological point of view of my plan
for restoring the dead to life so I set about my experiments without
any delay and with a completeness and a vigour that promised the most
completely successful results if success could at all be an ingredient
in what sober judgment would doubtless have denominated a mad-headed and
wild scheme

For more than half an hour I tried in vain by the assistance of the
hangman who acted under my directions Not the least symptom of
vitality presented itself and he had a smile upon his countenance as
he said in a bantering tone 

'I am afraid sir it is much easier to kill than to restore their
patients with doctors'

Before I could make him any reply for I felt that his observation had
a good amount of truth in it joined to its sarcasm the hanged man
uttered a loud scream and opened his eyes

I must own I was myself rather startled but I for some moments longer
continued the same means which had produced such an effect when
suddenly he sprang up and laid hold of me at the same time
exclaiming 

'Death death where is the treasure'

I had fully succeeded too fully and while the executioner looked on
with horror depicted in his countenance I fled from the room and the
house taking my way home as fast as I possibly could

A dread came over me that the restored man would follow me if he
should find out to whom it was he was indebted for the rather
questionable boon of a new life I packed up what articles I set the
greatest store by bade adieu to London and never have I since set foot
within that city

And you never met the man you had so resuscitated

Not till I saw Varney the vampire and as I tell you I am now
certain that he is the man

That is the strangest yarn that ever I heard said the admiral

A most singular circumstance said Henry

You may have noticed about his countenance said Dr Chillingworth a
strange distorted look

Yes yes

Well that has arisen from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles in
consequence of his having been hanged He will never lose it and it has
not a little contributed to give him the horrible look he has and to
invest him with some of the seeming outward attributes of the vampire

And that man who is now in the hall with him doctor said Henry is
the very hangman who executed him

The same He tells me that after I left he paid attention to the
restored man and completed what I had nearly done He kept him in his
house for a time and then made a bargain with him for a large sum of
money per annum all of which he has regularly been paid although he
tells me he has no more idea where Varney gets it than the man in the
moon

It is very strange but hark do you not hear the sound of voices in
angry altercation

Yes yes they have met Let us approach the windows now We may chance
to hear something of what they say to each other




 LXXVIII

THE ALTERCATION BETWEEN VARNEY AND THE EXECUTIONER IN THE HALL THE
MUTUAL AGREEMENT


Illustration

There was certainly a loud wrangling in the Hall just as the doctor
finished his most remarkable revelation concerning Sir Francis Varney a
revelation which by no means attacked the fact of his being a vampire or
not but rather on the contrary had a tendency to confirm any opinion
that might arise from the circumstance of his being restored to life
after his execution favourable to that belief

They all three now carefully approached the windows of the Hall to
listen to what was going on and after a few moments they distinctly
heard the voice of the hangman saying in loud and rather angry
accents 

I do not deny but that you have kept your word with me our bargain has
been as you say a profitable one but still I cannot see why that
circumstance should give you any sort of control over my actions

But what do you here said Varney impatiently

What do you cried the other

Nay to ask another question is not to answer mine I tell you that I
have special and most important business in this house you can have no
motive but curiosity

Can I not indeed What too if I have serious and important business
here

Impossible

Well I may as easily use such a term as regards what you call
important business but here I shall remain

Here you shall not remain

And will you make the somewhat hazardous attempt to force me to leave

Yes much as I dislike lifting my hand against you I must do so I
tell you that I must be alone in this house I have most special
reasons reasons which concern my continued existence

Your continued existence you talk of Tell me now how is it that you
have acquired so frightful a reputation in this neighbourhood Go where
I will the theme of conversation is Varney the vampire and it is
implicitly believed that you are one of those dreadful characters that
feed upon the life-blood of others only now and then revisiting the
tomb to which you ought long since to have gone in peace

Indeed

Yes what in the name of all that's inexplicable has induced you to
enact such a character

Enact it you say Can you then from all you have heard of me and
from all you know of me not conceive it possible that I am not enacting
any such character Why may it not be real Look at me Do I look like
one of the inhabitants of the earth

In sooth you do not

And yet I am as you see upon it Do not with an affected philosophy
doubt all that may happen to be in any degree repugnant to your usual
experiences

I am not one disposed to do so nor am I prepared to deny that such
dreadful beings may exist as vampires However whether or not you
belong to so frightful a class of creatures I do not intend to leave
here but I will make an agreement with you

Varney was silent and after a few moments pause the other
exclaimed 

There are people even now watching the place and no doubt you have
been seen coming into it

No no I was satisfied no one was here but you

Then you are wrong A Doctor Chillingworth of whom you know something
is here and him you have said you would do no harm to even to save
your life

I do know him You told me that it was to him that I was mainly
indebted for my mere existence and although I do not consider human
life to be a great boon I cannot bring myself to raise my hand against
the man who whatever might have been the motives for the deed at all
events did snatch me from the grave

Upon my word whispered the admiral there is something about that
fellow that I like after all

Hush said Henry listen to them This would all have been
unintelligible to us if you had not related to us what you have

I have just told you in time said Chillingworth it seems

Will you then said the hangman listen to proposals

Yes said Varney

Come along then and I will show you what I have been about and I
rather think you have already a shrewd guess as to my motive This
way this way

They moved off to some other part of the mansion and the sound of their
voices gradually died away so that after all the friends had not got
the least idea of what that motive was which still induced the vampire
and the hangman rather than leave the other on the premises to make an
agreement to stay with each other

What's to be done now said Henry

Wait said Dr Chillingworth wait and watch still I see nothing
else that can be done with any degree of safety

But what are we to wait for said the admiral

By waiting we shall perhaps find out was the doctor's reply but
you may depend that we never shall by interfering

Well well be it so It seems that we have no other resource And when
either or both of those fellows make their appearance and seem about to
leave what is to be done with them

They must be seized then and in order that that may be done without
any bloodshed we ought to have plenty of force here Henry could you
get your brother and Charles if he be sufficiently recovered to
come

Certainly and Jack Pringle

No said the admiral no Jack Pringle for me I have done with him
completely and I have made up my mind to strike him off the ship's
books and have nothing more to do with him

Well well added the doctor we will not have him then and it is
just as well for in all likelihood he would come drunk and we shall
be let me see five strong without him which ought to be enough to
take prisoners two men

Yes said Henry although one of them may be a vampire

That makes no difference said the admiral I'd as soon take a ship
manned with vampires as with Frenchmen

Henry started off upon his errand certainly leaving the admiral and the
doctor in rather a critical situation while he was gone for had Varney
the vampire and the hangman chosen they could certainly easily have
overcome so inefficient a force

The admiral would of course have fought and so might the doctor as
far as his hands would permit him but if the others had really been
intent upon mischief they could from their downright superior physical
power have taken the lives of the two that were opposed to them

But somehow the doctor appeared to have a great confidence in the
affair Whether that confidence arose from what the vampire had said
with regard to him or from any hidden conviction of his own that they
would not yet emerge from the Hall we cannot say but certain it is he
waited the course of events with great coolness

No noise for some time came from the house but then the sounds as if
workmen were busy within it were suddenly resumed and with more vigour
than before

It was nearly two hours before Henry made the private signal which had
been agreed upon as that which should proclaim his return and then he
and his brother with Charles who when he heard of the matter would
notwithstanding the persuasions of Flora to the contrary come got
quietly over the fence at a part of the garden which was quite hidden
from the house by abundant vegetation and the whole three of them took
up a position that tolerably well commanded a view of the house while
they were themselves extremely well hidden behind a dense mass of
evergreens

Did you see that rascal Jack Pringle said the admiral

Yes said Henry he is drunk

Ah to be sure

And we had no little difficulty in shaking him off He suspected where
we were going but I think by being peremptory we got fairly rid of
him

The vagabond if he comes here I'll brain him I will the swab Why
lately he's done nothing but drink That's the way with him He'll go on
sometimes for a year and more and not take more than enough to do him
good and then all at once for about six or eight weeks he does
nothing but drink

Well well we can do without him said Henry

Without him I should think so Do you hear those fellows in the Hall
at work D n me if I haven't all of a sudden thought what the reason
of it all is

What what said the doctor anxiously

Why that rascal Varney you know had his house burnt down

Yes well

Yes well I dare say he didn't think it well But however he no
doubt wants another so you see my idea is that he's stealing the
material from Bannerworth Hall

Oh is that your notion

Yes and a very natural one I think too Master Doctor whatever you
may think of it Come now have you a better

Oh dear no certainly not but I have a notion that something to eat
would comfort the inward man much

And so would something to drink blow me if it wouldn't said Jack
Pringle suddenly making his appearance

The admiral made a rush upon him but he was restrained by the others
and Jack with a look of triumph said 

Why what's amiss with you now I ain't drunk now Come come you have
something dangerous in the wind I know so I've made up my mind to be
in it so don't put yourself out of the way If you think I don't know
all about it you are mistaken for I do The vampire is in the house
yonder and I'm the fellow to tackle him I believe you my boys

Good God said the doctor what shall we do

Nothing said Jack as he took a bottle from his pocket and applied
the neck of it to his lips nothing nothing at all

There's something to begin with said the admiral as with his stick
he gave the bottle a sudden blow that broke it and spilt all its
contents leaving Jack petrified with the bit of the neck of it still
in his mouth

My eye admiral he said was that done like a British seaman My
eye was that the trick of a lubber or of a thorough-going first-rater
first-rater My eye 

Hold your noise will you you are not drunk yet and I was determined
that you should not get so which you soon would with that rum-bottle
if I had not come with a broadside across it Now you may stay but
mark me you are on active service now and must do nothing without
orders

Ay ay your honour said Jack as he dropped the neck of the bottle
and looked ruefully upon the ground from whence arose the aroma of
rum ay ay but it's a hard case take it how you will to have your
grog stopped but d n it I never had it stopped yet when it was in my
mouth

Henry and Charles could not forbear a smile at Jack's discomfiture
which however they were very glad of for they knew full well his
failing and that in the course of another half hour he would have been
drunk and incapable of being controlled except as on some former
occasions by the exercise of brute force

But Jack was evidently displeased and considered himself to be
grievously insulted which after all was the better inasmuch as
while he was brooding over his wrongs he was quiet when otherwise it
might have been a very difficult matter to make him so

They partook of some refreshments and as the day advanced the
brothers Bannerworth as well as Charles Holland began to get very
anxious upon the subject of the proceedings of Sir Francis Varney in the
Hall

They conversed in low tones exhausting every as they considered
possible conjecture to endeavour to account for his mysterious
predilection for that abode but nothing occurred to them of a
sufficiently probable motive to induce them to adopt it as a conclusion

They more than suspected Dr Chillingworth because he was so silent
and hazarded no conjecture at all of knowing something or of having
formed to himself some highly probable hypothesis upon the subject but
they could not get him to agree that such was the case

When they challenged him upon the subject all he would say was 

My good friends you perceive that there is a great mystery somewhere
and I do hope that to-night it will be cleared up satisfactorily

With this they were compelled to be satisfied and now the soft and
sombre shades of evening began to creep over the scene enveloping all
objects in the dimness and repose of early night

The noise from the house had ceased and all was profoundly still But
more than once Henry fancied he heard footsteps outside the garden

He mentioned his suspicions to Charles Holland who immediately said 

The same thing has come to my ears

Indeed Then it must be so we cannot both of us have merely imagined
such a thing You may depend that this place is beleaguered in some way
and that to-night will be productive of events which will throw a great
light upon the affairs connected with this vampire that have hitherto
baffled conjecture

Hush said Charles there again I am quite confident I heard a
sound as of a broken twig outside the garden-wall The doctor and the
admiral are in deep discussion about something shall we tell them

No let us listen as yet

They bent all their attention to listening inclining their ears towards
the ground and after a few moments they felt confident that more than
one footstep was creeping along as cautiously as possible under the
garden wall After a few moments consultation Henry made up his
mind he being the best acquainted with the localities of the place to
go and reconnoitre so he without saying anything to the doctor or the
admiral glided from where he was in the direction of a part of the
fence which he knew he could easily scale

THE vampire'S DANGER THE LAST REFUGE THE RUSE OF HENRY BANNERWORTH


Illustration

Yet knowing to what deeds of violence the passions of a lawless mob will
sometimes lead them and having the experience of what had been
attempted by the alarmed and infuriated populace on a former occasion
against the Hall Henry Bannerworth was reasonably enough not without
his fears that something might occur of a nature yet highly dangerous to
the stability of his ancient house

He did not actually surmount the fence but he crept so close to it
that he could get over in a moment if he wished and if any one should
move or speak on the other side he should be quite certain to hear
them

For a few moments all was still and then suddenly he heard some one
say in a low voice

Hist hist did you hear nothing

I thought I did said another but I now am doubtful

Listen again

What thought Henry can be the motives of these men lying secreted
here It is most extraordinary what they can possibly want unless they
are brewing danger for the Hall

Most cautiously now he raised himself so that his eyes could just look
over the fence and then indeed he was astonished

He had expected to see two or three persons at the utmost what was his
surprise to find a compact mass of men crouching down under the garden
wall as far as his eye could reach

For a few moments he was so surprised that he continued to gaze on
heedless of the danger there might be from a discovery that he was
playing the part of a spy upon them

When however his first sensations of surprise were over he cautiously
removed to his former position and just as he did so he heard those
who had before spoken again in low tones breaking the stillness of
the night

I am resolved upon it said one I am quite determined I will
please God rid the country of that dreadful man

Don't call him a man said the oilier

Well well it is a wrong name to apply to a vampire

It is Varney after all then said Henry Bannerworth to
himself it is his life that they seek What can be done to save
him for saved he shall be if I can compass such an object I feel that
there is yet a something in his character which is entitled to
consideration and he shall not be savagely murdered while I have an arm
to raise in his defence But if anything is now to be done it must be
done by stratagem for the enemy are by far in too great force to be
personally combatted with

Henry resolved to take the advice of his friends and with that view he
went silently and quietly back to where they were and communicated to
them the news that he had so unexpectedly discovered

They were all much surprised and then the doctor said

You may depend that since the disappointment of the mob in the
destruction of this place they have had their eye upon Varney He has
been dogged here by some one and then by degrees that assemblage has
sought the spot

He's a doomed man then remarked the admiral for what can save him
from a determined number of persons who by main force will overcome
us let us make what stand we may in his defence

Is there no hiding-place in the house said Charles where you might
after warning him of his danger conceal him

There are plenty but of what avail would that be if they burn down
the Hall which in all probability they will

None certainly

There is but one chance said Henry and that is to throw them off
the scent and induce them to think that he whom they seek is not here
I think that may possibly be done by boldness

But how

I will go among them and make the effort

He at once left the friends for he felt that there might be no time to
lose and hastening to the same part of the wall over which he had
looked so short a time before he clambered over it and cried in a
loud voice

Stop the vampire stop the vampire

Where where shouted a number of persons at once turning their eyes
eagerly towards the spot where Henry stood

There across the fields cried Henry I have lain in wait for him
long but he has eluded me and is making his way again towards the old
ruins where I am sure he has some hiding-place that he thinks will
elude all search There I see his dusky form speeding onwards

Come on cried several to the ruins to the ruins We'll smoke him
out if he will not come by fair means we must have him dead or alive

Yes to the ruins shouted the throng of persons who up to this time
had preserved so cautious a silence and in a few moments more Henry
Bannerworth had the satisfaction of finding that his ruse had been
perfectly successful for Bannerworth Hall and its vicinity were
completely deserted and the mob in a straggling mass went over hedge
and ditch towards those ruins in which there was nothing to reward the
exertions they might choose to make in the way of an exploration of
them but the dead body of the villain Marchdale who had come there to
so dreadful but so deserved a death




 LXXX

THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODY OF MARCHDALE IN THE RUINS BY THE MOB THE
BURNING OF THE CORPSE THE MURDER OF THE HANGMAN


Illustration

The mob reached the ruins of Bannerworth Hall and crowded round it on
all sides with the view of ascertaining if a human creature dead or
alive were there various surmises were afloat and some were for
considering that everybody but themselves or their friends must be
nothing less than vampires Indeed a strange man suddenly appearing
among them would have caused a sensation and a ring would no doubt
have been formed round him and then a hasty council held or what was
more probable some shout or word uttered by some one behind who could
not understand what was going on in front would have determined them to
commit some desperate outrage and the sacrifice of life would have been
the inevitable result of such an unfortunate concurrence of
circumstances

There was a pause before anyone ventured among the ruins the walls were
carefully looked to and in more than one instance but they were found
dangerous what were remaining some parts had been so completely
destroyed that there were nothing but heaps of rubbish

However curiosity was exerted to such an extraordinary pitch that it
overcame the fear of danger in search of the horrible for they
believed that if there were any one in the ruins he must be a vampire
of course and they were somewhat cautious in going near such a
creature lest in so doing they should meet with some accident and
become vampires too

This was a dreadful reflection and one that every now and then
impressed itself upon the individuals composing the mob but at the same
time any new impulse or a shout and they immediately became insensible
to all fear the mere impulse is the dominant one and then all is
forgotten

The scene was an impressive one the beautiful house and grounds looked
desolate and drear many of the trees were stripped and broken down and
many scorched and burned while the gardens and flower beds the delight
of the Bannerworth family were rudely trodden under foot by the rabble
and all those little beauties so much admired and tended by the
inhabitants were now utterly destroyed and in such a state that their
site could not even be detected by the former owners

It was a sad sight to see such a sacrilege committed such violence
done to private feelings as to have all these places thrown open to the
scrutiny of the brutal and vulgar who are incapable of appreciating or
understanding the pleasures of a refined taste

The ruins presented a remarkable contrast to what the place had been but
a very short time before and now the scene of desolation was complete
there was no one spot in which the most wretched could find shelter

To be sure under the lee of some broken and crumbling wall that
tottered rather than stood a huddled wretch might have found shelter
from the wind but it would have been at the risk of his life and not
there complete

The mob became quiet for some moments but was not so long indeed a
mob of people which is in fact always composed of the most
disorderly characters to be found in a place is not exactly the
assembly that is most calculated for quietness somebody gave a shout
and then somebody else shouted and the one wide throat of the whole
concourse was opened and sent forth a mighty yell

After this exhibition of power they began to run about like
mad traverse the grounds from one end to the other and then the ruins
were in progress of being explored

This was a tender affair and had to be done with some care and caution
by those who were so engaged and they walked over crumbling and decayed
masses

In one or two places they saw what appeared to be large holes into
which the building materials had been sunk by their own weight through
the flooring that seemed as roofs to some cellars or dungeons

Seeing this they knew not how soon some other part might sink in and
carry their precious bodies down with the mass of rubbish this gave an
interest to the scene a little danger is a sort of salt to an
adventure and enables those who have taken part in it to talk of their
exploits and of their dangers which is pleasant to do and to hear in
the ale-house and by the inglenook in the winter

However when a few had gone some distance others followed when they
saw them enter the place in safety and at length the whole ruins were
covered with living men and not a few women who seemed necessary to
make up the elements of mischief in this case

There were some shouting and hallooing from one to the other as they
hurried about the ruins

At length they had explored the ruins nearly all over when one man who
had stood a few minutes upon a spot gazing intently upon something
suddenly exclaimed 

Hilloa hurrah here we are altogether come on I've found
him I've found recollect it's me and nobody else has
found hurrah

Then with a wild kind of frenzy he threw his hat up into the air as
if to attract attention and call others round him to see what it was
he had found

What's the matter Bill exclaimed one who came up to him and who had
been close at hand

The matter why I've found him that's the matter old man replied
the first

What a whale

No a wampyre the blessed wampyre there he is don't you see him
under them ere bricks

Oh that's not him he got away

I don't care replied the other who got away or who didn't I know
this much that he's a wampyre he wouldn't be there if he warn't

This was an unanswerable argument and nobody could deny it
consequently there was a cessation of talk and the people then came
up as the two first were looking at the body

Whose is it inquired a dozen voices

Illustration

Not Sir Francis Varney's said the second speaker the clothes are not
his 

No no not Sir Francis's

But I tell you what mates said the first speaker that if it isn't
Sir Francis Varney's it is somebody else's as bad I dare say now
he's a wictim

A what

A wictim to the wampyre and if he sees the blessed moonlight he will
be a wampyre hisself and so shall we be too if he puts his teeth into
us

So we shall so we shall said the mob and their flesh begin to run
cold and there was a feeling of horror creeping over the whole body of
persons within hearing

I tell you what it is our only plan will be to get him out of the
ruins then remarked another

What said one who's going to handle such cattle if you've a sore
about you and his blood touches you who's to say you won't be a
vampire too

No no you won't said an old woman

I won't try was the happy rejoinder I ain't a-going to carry a
wampyre on my two legs home to my wife and small family of seven
children and another a-coming

There was a pause for a few moments and then one man more adventurous
than the rest exclaimed 

Well vampire or no vampire his dead body can harm no one so here
goes to get it out help me who will once have it out and then we can
prevent any evil by burning it and thus destroying the whole body

Hurrah shouted three or four more as they jumped down into the hole
formed by the falling in of the materials which had crushed Marchdale to
death for it was his body they had discovered

They immediately set to work to displace such of the materials as lay on
the body and then having cleared it of all superincumbent rubbish
they proceeded to lift it up but found that it had got entangled as
they called it with some chains with some trouble they got them off
and the body was lifted out to a higher spot

Now what's to be done inquired one

Burn it said another

Hurrah shouted a female voice we've got the wampyre run a stake
through his body and then place him upon some dry wood there's plenty
to be had about here I am sure and then burn him to a cinder

That's right old woman that's right said a man nothing better
the devil must be in him if he come to life after that I should say

There might be something in that and the mob shouted its approbation
as it was sure to do as anything stupid or senseless and the proposal
might be said to have been carried by acclamation and it required only
the execution

This was soon done There were plenty of laths and rafters and the
adjoining wood furnished an abundant supply of dry sticks so there was
no want of fuel

There was a loud shout as each accession of sticks took place and as
each individual threw his bundle into the heap each man felt all the
self-devotion to the task as the Scottish chieftain who sacrificed
himself and seven sons in the battle for his superior and when one son
was cut down the man filled up his place with the exclamation Another
for Hector until he himself fell as the last of his race

Soon now the heap became prodigious and it required an effort to get
the mangled corpse upon this funeral bier but it was then a shout from
the mob that rent the air announced both the fact and their
satisfaction

The next thing to be done was to light the pile this was no easy task
but like all others it was accomplished and the dead body of the
vampire's victim was thrown on to prevent that becoming a vampire too
in its turn

There boys said one he'll not see the moonlight that's certain
and the sooner we put a light to this the better for it may be the
soldiers will be down upon us before we know anything of it so now
who's got a light

This was a question that required a deal of searching but at length
one was found by one of the mob coming forward and after drawing his
pipe vigorously for some moments he collected some scraps of paper upon
which he emptied the contents of the pipe with the hope they would take
fire

In this however he was doomed to disappointment for it produced
nothing but a deal of smoke and the paper burned without producing any
flame

This act of disinterestedness however was not without its due
consequences for there were several who had pipes and fired with the
hope of emulating the first projector of the scheme for raising the
flame they joined together and potting the contents of their pipes
together on some paper straw and chips they produced after some
little trouble a flame

Then there was a shout and the burning mass was then placed in a
favourable position nearer the pile of materials collected for burning
and then in a few moments it began to take light one piece
communicated the fire to another until the whole was in a blaze

When the first flame fairly reached the top a loud and tremendous shout
arose from the mob and the very welkin re-echoed with its fulness

Then the forked flames rushed through the wood and hissed and crackled
as they flew throwing up huge masses of black smoke and casting a
peculiar reflection around Not a sound was heard save the hissing and
roaring of the flames which seemed like the approaching of a furious
whirlwind

At length there was nothing to be seen but the blackened mass it was
enveloped in one huge flame that threw out a great heat so much so
that those nearest to it felt induced to retire from before it

I reckon said one that he's pretty well done by this time he's had
a warm berth of it up there

Yes said another farmer Walkings's sheep he roasted whole at last
harvest-home hadn't such a fire as this I'll warrant there's no such
fire in the county why it would prevent a frost I do believe it
would

So it would neighbour answered another

Yes replied a third but you'd want such a one corner of each field
though

                                   

There was much talk and joking going on among the men who stood around
in the midst of which however they were disturbed by a loud shout and
upon looking in the quarter whence it came they saw stealing from among
the ruins the form of a man

He was a strange odd looking man and at the time it was very doubtful
among the mob as to whom it was nobody could tell and more than one
looked at the burning pile and then at the man who seemed to be so
mysteriously present as if they almost imagined that the body had got
away

Who is it exclaimed one

Danged if I knows said another looking very hard and very white at
the same time I hope it ain't the chap what we've burned here jist
now

No said the female that you may be sure of for he's had a stake
through his body and as you said he can never get over that for as
the stake is consumed so are his vitals and that's a sure sign he's
done for

Yes yes she's right a vampire may live upon blood but cannot do
without his inside

This was so obvious to them all that it was at once conceded and a
general impression pervaded the mob that it might be Sir Francis Varney
a shout ensued

Hurrah After him there's a vampire there he goes after him catch
him burn him

And a variety of other exclamations were uttered at the same time the
victim of popular wrath seemed to be aware that he was now discovered
and made off with all possible expedition towards some wood

Away went the mob in pursuit hooting and hallooing like demons and
denouncing the unfortunate being with all the terrors that could be
imagined and which naturally added greater speed to the unfortunate
man

However some among the mob seeing that there was every probability of
the stranger's escaping at a mere match of speed brought a little
cunning to bear upon matter and took a circuit round and thus
intercepted him

This was not accomplished without a desperate effort and by the best
runners who thus reached the spot he made for before he could get
there

When the stranger saw himself thus intercepted he endeavoured to fly in
a different direction but was soon secured by the mob who made
somewhat free with his person and commenced knocking him about

Have mercy on me said the stranger What do you want I am not rich
but take all I have

What do you do here inquired twenty voices Come tell us that what
do you do here and who are you

A stranger quite a stranger to these parts

Oh yes he's a stranger but that's all the worse for him he's a
vampire there's no doubt about that

Good God said the man I am a living and breathing man like
yourselves I have done no wrong and injured no man be merciful unto
me I intend no harm

Of course not send him to the fire take him back to the ruins to the
fire

Ay and run a stake through his body and then he's safe for life I am
sure he has something to do with the vampire and who knows if he ain't
a vampire how soon he may become one

Ah that's very true bring him back to the fire and we'll try the
effects of the fire upon his constitution

I tell you what neighbour it's my opinion that as one fool makes
many so one vampire makes many

So it does so it does there's much truth and reason in that
neighbour I am decidedly of that opinion too

Come along then cried the mob cuffing and pulling the unfortunate
stranger with them

Mercy mercy

But it was useless to call for mercy to men whose superstitious feelings
urged them on for when the demon of superstition is active no matter
what form it may take it always results in cruelty and wickedness to
all

Various were the shouts and menaces of the mob and the stranger saw no
hope of life unless he could escape from the hands of the people who
surrounded him

They had now nearly reached the ruins and the stranger who was
certainly a somewhat odd and remarkable looking man and who appeared in
their eyes the very impersonation of their notions of a vampire was
thrust from one to the other kicked by one and then cuffed by the
other as if he was doomed to run the gauntlet

Down with the vampire said the mob

I am no vampire said the stranger I am new to these parts and I
pray you have mercy upon me I have done you no wrong Hear me I know
nothing of these people of whom you speak

That won't do you've come here to see what you can do I dare say
and though you may have been hurt by the vampire and may be only your
misfortune and not your fault yet the mischief is as great as ever it
was or can be you become in spite of yourself a vampire and do the
same injury to others that has been done to you there's no help for
you

No help we can't help it shouted the mob he must die throw him
on the pile

Put a stake through him first though exclaimed the humane female
put a stake through him and then he's safe

This horrible advice had an electric effect on the stranger who jumped
up and eluded the grasp of several hands that were stretched forth to
seize him

Throw him upon the burning wood shouted one

And a stake through his body suggested the humane female again who
seemed to have this one idea in her heart and no other and upon every
available opportunity she seemed to be anxious to give utterance to the
comfortable notion

Seize him exclaimed one

Never let him go said another we've gone too far to hang back now
and if he escape he will visit us in our sleep were it only out of
spite

The stranger made a dash among the ruins and for a moment
out-stripped his pursuers but a few more adventurous than the rest
succeeded in driving him into an angle formed by two walls and the
consequence was he was compelled to come to a stand

Seize him seize him exclaimed all those at a distance

The stranger seeing he was now nearly surrounded and had no chance of
escape save by some great effort seized a long piece of wood and
struck two of his assailants down at once and then dashed through the
opening

He immediately made for another part of the ruins and succeeded in
making his escape for some short distance but was unable to keep up the
speed that was required for his great exertion before had nearly
exhausted him and the fear of a cruel death before his eyes was not
enough to give him strength or lend speed to his flight He had
suffered too much from violence and though he ran with great speed
yet those who followed were uninjured and fresher he had no chance

They came very close upon him at the corner of a field which he
endeavoured to cross and had succeeded in doing and he made a
desperate attempt to scramble up the bank that divided the field from
the next but he slipped back almost exhausted into the ditch and the
whole mob came up

However he got on the bank and leaped into the next field and then he
was immediately surrounded by those who pursued him and he was struck
down

Down with the vampire kill him he's one of em run a stake
through him were a few of the cries of the infuriated mob of people
who were only infuriated because he attempted to escape their murderous
intentions

It was strange to see how they collected in a ring as the unfortunate
man lay on the ground panting for breath and hardly able to
speak their infuriated countenances plainly showing the mischief they
were intent upon

Have mercy upon me he exclaimed as he lay on the earth I have no
power to help myself

The mob returned no answer but stood collecting their numbers as they
came up

Have mercy on me it cannot be any pleasure to you to spill my blood I
am unable to resist I am one man among many you surely cannot wish to
beat me to death

We want to hurt no one except in our own defence and we won't be made
vampires of because you don't like to die

No no we won't be vampires exclaimed the mob and there arose a
great shout from the mob

Are you men fathers have you families if so I have the same ties
as you have spare me for their sakes do not murder me you will
leave one an orphan if you do besides what have I done I have injured
no one

I tell you what friends if we listen to him we shall all be vampires
and all our children will all be vampires and orphans

So we shall so we shall down with him

The man attempted to get up but in doing so he received a heavy blow
from a hedge-stake wielded by the herculean arm of a peasant The sound
of the blow was heard by those immediately around and the man fell
dead There was a pause and those nearest apparently fearful of the
consequences and hardly expecting the catastrophe began to disperse
and the remainder did so very soon afterwards




 LXXXI

THE vampire'S FLIGHT HIS DANGER AND THE LAST PLACE OF REFUGE


Illustration

Leaving the disorderly and vicious mob who were thus sacrificing human
life to their excited passions we return to the brothers Bannerworth
and the doctor who together with Admiral Bell still held watch over
the hall

No indication of the coming forth of Varney presented itself for some
time longer and then at least they thought they heard a window open
and turning their eyes in the direction whence the sound proceeded
they could see the form of a man slowly and cautiously emerging from it

As far as they could judge from the distance at which they were that
form partook much of the appearance and the general aspect of Sir
Francis Varney and the more they looked and noticed its movements the
more they felt convinced that such was the fact

There comes your patient doctor said the admiral

Don't call him my patient said the doctor if you please

Why you know he is and you are in a manner of speaking bound to look
after him Well what is to be done

He must not on any account said Dr Chillingworth be allowed to
leave the place Believe me I have the very strongest reasons for
saying so

He shall not leave it then said Henry

Even as he spoke Henry Bannerworth darted forward and Sir Francis
Varney dropped from the window out of which he had clambered close to
his feet

Hold cried Henry you are my prisoner

With the most imperturbable coolness in the world Sir Francis Varney
turned upon him and replied 

And pray Henry Bannerworth what have I done to provoke your wrath

What have you done have you not like a thief broken into my house
Can you ask what you have done

Ay said the vampire like a thief perchance and yet no thief May
I ask you what there is to steal in the house

By the time this short dialogue had been uttered the rest of the party
had come up and Varney was so far as regarded numbers a prisoner

Well gentlemen he said with that strange contortion of countenance
which now they all understood arose from the fact of his having been
hanged and restored to life again Well gentlemen now that you have
beleaguered me in such a way may I ask you what it is about

If you will step aside with me Sir Francis Varney for a moment said
Dr Chillingworth I will make to you a communication which will enable
you to know what it is all about

Oh with pleasure said the vampire I am not ill at present but
still sir I have no objection to hear what you have to say

He stepped a few paces on one side with the doctor while the others
waited not without some amount of impatience for the result of the
communication All that they could hear was that Varney said
suddenly 

You are quite mistaken

And then the doctor appeared to be insisting upon something which the
vampire listened to patiently and at the end burst out with 

Why doctor you must be dreaming

At this Dr Chillingworth at once left him and advancing to his
friends he said 

Sir Francis Varney denies in toto all that I have related to you
concerning him therefore I can say no more than that I earnestly
recommend you before you let him go to see that he takes nothing of
value with him

Why what can you mean said Varney

Search him said the doctor I will tell you why very shortly

Indeed indeed said Sir Francis Varney Now gentlemen I will give
you a chance of behaving justly and quietly so saving yourself the
danger of acting otherwise I have made repeated offers to take this
house either as a tenant or as a purchaser all of which offers have
been declined upon I dare say a common enough principle namely one
which induces people to enhance the value of anything they have for
disposal if it be unique by making it difficult to come at Seeing
that you had deserted the place I could make no doubt but that it was
to be had so I came here to make a thorough examination of its
interior to see if it would suit me I find that it will not
therefore I have only to apologise for the intrusion and to wish you a
remarkably good evening

That won't do said the doctor

What won't do sir

This excuse will not do Sir Francis Varney You are although you deny
it the man who was hanged in London some years ago for a highway
robbery

Varney laughed and held up his hands exclaiming 

Alas alas our good friend the doctor has studied too hard his
wits probably at the best of times none of the clearest have become
hopelessly entangled

Do you deny said Henry then that you are that man

Most unequivocally

I assert it said the doctor and now I will tell you all for I
perceive you hesitate about searching Sir Francis Varney I tell you
all why it is that he has such an affection for Bannerworth Hall

Before you do said Varney there is a pill for you which you may
find more nauseous and harder of digestion than any your shop can
furnish

As Varney uttered these words he suddenly drew from his pocket a
pistol and levelling it at the unfortunate doctor he fired it full at
him

The act was so sudden so utterly unexpected and so stunning that it
was done before any one could move hand or foot to prevent it Henry
Bannerworth and his brother were the furthest off from the vampire and
unhappily in the rush which they as soon us possible made towards
him they knocked down the admiral who impeded them much and before
they could spring over or past him Sir Francis Varney was gone

So sudden too had been his departure that they had not the least idea
in which direction he had gone so that to follow him would have been a
work of the greatest possible difficulty

Notwithstanding however both the difficulty and the danger for no
doubt the vampire was well enough armed Henry and his brother both
rushed after the murderer as they now believed him to be in the route
which they thought it was most probable he would take namely that
which led towards the garden gate

They reached that spot in a few moments but all was profoundly still
Not the least trace of any one could be seen high or low and they were
compelled after a cursory examination to admit that Sir Francis Varney
had again made his escape despite the great odds that were against him
in point of numbers

He has gone said Henry Let us go back and see into the state of
poor Dr Chillingworth who I fear is a dead man

They hurried back to the spot and there they found the admiral looking
as composed as possible and solacing himself with a pinch of snuff as
he gazed upon the apparently lifeless form at his feet

Is he dead said Henry

I should say he was replied the admiral such a shot as that was
don't want to be repeated Well I liked the doctor with all his faults
He only had one foolish way with him and that was that he shirked his
grog

This is an awful catastrophe said Henry as he knelt down by the side
of the body Assist me some of you Where is Charles

I'll be hanged said the admiral if I know He disappeared
somewhere

This is a night of mystery as well as terror Alas poor Dr
Chillingworth I little thought that you would have fallen a victim to
the man whom you preserved from death How strange it is that you should
have snatched from the tomb the very individual who was eventually to
take your own life

The brothers gently raised the body of the doctor and carried it on to
the glass plot which was close at hand

Farewell kind and honest-hearted Chillingworth said Henry I shall
many and many a time feel your loss and now I will rest not until I
have delivered up to justice your murderer All consideration or
feeling for what seemed to be latent virtues in that strange and
inexplicable man Varney shall vanish and he shall reap the
consequences of the crime he has now committed

It was a cold blooded cowardly murder said his brother

It was but you may depend the doctor was about to reveal something to
us which Varney so much dreaded that he took his life as the only
effectual way at the moment of stopping him

It must be so said Henry

And now said the admiral it's too late and we shall not know it at
all That's the way A fellow saves up what he has got to tell till it
is too late to tell it and down he goes to Davy Jones's locker with all
his secrets aboard

Not always said Dr Chillingworth suddenly sitting bolt
upright not always

Henry and his brother started back in amazement and the admiral was so
taken by surprise that had not the resuscitated doctor suddenly
stretched out his hand and laid hold of him by the ankle he would have
made a precipitate retreat

Hilloa murder he cried Let me go How do I know but you may be a
vampire by now as you were shot by one

Henry soonest recovered from the surprise of the moment and with the
most unfeigned satisfaction he cried 

Thank God you are unhurt Dr Chillingworth Why he must have missed
you by a miracle

Not at all said the doctor Help me up thank you all right I'm
only a little singed about the whiskers He hit me safe enough

Then how have you escaped

Why from the want of a bullet in the pistol to be sure I can
understand it all well enough He wanted to create sufficient confusion
to cover a desperate attempt to escape and he thought that would be
best done by seeming so shoot me The suddenness of the shock and the
full belief at the moment that he had sent a bullet into my brains
made me fall and produced a temporary confusion of ideas amounting to
insensibility

From which you are happily recovered Thank Heaven that after all he
is not such a villain as this act would have made him

Ah said the admiral it takes people who have lived a little in
these affairs to know the difference in sound between a firearm with a
bullet in it and one without I knew it was all right

Then why did you not say so admiral

What was the use I thought the doctor might be amused to know what you
should say of him so you see I didn't interfere and as I am not a
good hand at galloping after anybody I didn't try that part of the
business but just remained where I was

Alas alas cried the doctor I much fear that by his going I have
lost all that I expected to be able to do for you Henry It's of not
the least use now telling you or troubling you about it You may now
sell or let Bannerworth Hall to whomever you please for I am afraid it
is really worthless

What on earth do you mean said Henry Why doctor will you keep up
this mystery among us If you have anything to say why not say it at
once

Because I tell you it's of no use now The game is up Sir Francis
Varney has escaped but still I don't know that I need exactly
hesitate

There can be no reason for your hesitating about making a communication
to us said Henry It is unfriendly not to do so

My dear boy you will excuse me for saying that you don't know what you
are talking about

Can you give any reason

Yes respect for the living I should have to relate something of the
dead which would be hurtful to their feelings

Henry was silent for a few moments and then he said 

What dead And who are the living

Another time whispered the doctor to him another time Henry Do
not press me now But you shall know all another time

I must be content But now let us remember that another man yet lingers
in Bannerworth Hall I will endure suspense on his account no longer He
is an intruder there so I go at once to dislodge him

No one made any opposition to this move not even the doctor so Henry
preceded them all to the house They passed through the open window into
the long hall and from thence into every apartment of the mansion
without finding the object of their search But from one of the windows
up to which there grew great masses of ivy there hung a rope by which
any one might easily have let himself down and no doubt therefore
existed in all their minds that the hangman had sufficiently profited by
the confusion incidental to the supposed shooting of the doctor to make
good his escape from the place

And so after all said Henry we are completely foiled

We may be said Dr Chillingworth but it is perhaps going too far
to say that we actually are One thing however is quite clear and
that is no good can be done here

Then let us go home said the admiral I did not think from the first
that any good would be done here

They all left the garden together now so that almost for the first
time Bannerworth Hall was left to itself unguarded and unwatched by
any one whatever It was with an evident and a marked melancholy that
the doctor proceeded with the party to the cottage-house of the
Bannerworths but as after what he had said Henry forbore to question
him further upon those subjects which he admitted he was keeping secret
and as none of the party were much in a cue for general conversation
the whole of them walked on with more silence than usually characterised
them




 LXXXII

CHARLES HOLLAND'S PURSUIT OF THE vampire THE DANGEROUS INTERVIEW


Illustration

It will be recollected that the admiral had made a remark about Charles
Holland having suddenly disappeared and it is for us now to account for
that disappearance and to follow him to the pathway he had chosen

The fact was that he when Varney fired the shot at the doctor or what
was the supposed shot was the farthest from the vampire and he on
that very account had the clearest and best opportunity of marking
which route he took when he had discharged the pistol

He was not confused by the smoke as the others were nor was he stunned
by the noise of the discharge but he distinctly saw Varney dart across
one of the garden beds and make for the summer-house instead of for
the garden gate as Henry had supposed was the most probable path he had
chosen

Now Charles Holland either had an inclination for some reasons of his
own to follow the vampire alone or on the spur of the moment he had
not time to give an alarm to the others but certain it is that he did
unaided rush after him He saw him enter the summer-house and pass out
of it again at the back portion of it as he had once before done when
surprised in his interview with Flora

But the vampire did not now as he had done on the former occasion hide
immediately behind the summer-house He seemed to be well aware that
that expedient would not answer twice so he at once sped onwards
clearing the garden fence and taking to the meadows

It formed evidently no part of the intentions of Charles Holland to come
up with him He was resolved upon dogging his footsteps to know where
he should go so that he might have a knowledge of his hiding-place if
he had one

I must and will said Charles to himself penetrate the mystery that
hangs about this most strange and inexplicable being I will have an
interview with him not in hostility for I forgive him the evil he has
done me but with a kindly spirit and I will ask him to confide in me

Charles therefore did not keep so close upon the heels of the vampire
as to excite any suspicions of his intention to follow him but he
waited by the garden paling long enough not only for Varney to get some
distance off but long enough likewise to know that the pistol which had
been fired at the doctor had produced no real bad effects except
singing some curious tufts of hair upon the sides of his face which the
doctor was pleased to call whiskers

I thought as much was Charles's exclamation when he heard the
doctor's voice It would have been strikingly at variance with all
Varney's other conduct if he had committed such a deliberate and
heartless murder

Then as the form of the vampire could be but dimly seen Charles ran on
for some distance in the direction he had taken and then paused again
so that if Varney heard the sound of footsteps and paused to listen
they had ceased again probably and nothing was discernible

In this manner he followed the mysterious individual if we may really
call him such for above a mile and then Varney made a rapid detour
and took his way towards the town

He went onwards with wonderful precision now in a right line not
stopping at any obstruction in the way of fences hedges or ditches
so that it took Charles some exertion to which just then he was
scarcely equal to keep up with him

At length the outskirts of the town were gained and then Varney paused
and looked around him scarcely allowing Charles who was now closer to
him than he had been time to hide himself from observation which
however he did accomplish by casting himself suddenly upon the ground
so that he could not be detected against the sky which then formed a
back ground to the spot where he was

Apparently satisfied that he had completely now eluded the pursuit if
any had been attempted of those whom he had led in such a state of
confusion the vampire walked hastily towards a house that was to let
and which was only to be reached by going up an avenue of trees and
then unlocking a gate in a wall which bounded the premises next to the
avenue But the vampire appeared to be possessed of every facility for
effecting an entrance to the place and producing from his pocket a key
he at once opened the gate and disappeared within the precincts of
those premises

He no doubt felt that he was hunted by the mob of the town and hence
his frequent change of residence since his own had been burnt down
and indeed situated as he was there can be no manner of doubt that he
would have been sacrificed to the superstitious fury of the populace if
they could but have got hold of him

He had from his knowledge which was no doubt accurate and complete of
what had been done a good idea of what his own fate would be were he
to fall into the hands of that ferocious multitude each individual
composing which felt a conviction that there would be no peace nor
hope of prosperity or happiness on the place until he the arch
vampire of all the supposed vampires was destroyed

Illustration

Charles did pause for a few moments after having thus become roused to
consider whether he should then attempt to have the interview he had
resolved upon having by some means or another or defer it now that he
knew where Varney was to be found until another time

But when he came to consider how extremely likely it was that even in
the course of a few hours Varney might shift his abode for some good
and substantial reasons he at once determined upon attempting to see
him

But how to accomplish such a purpose was not the easiest question in the
world to answer If he rung the bell that presented itself above the
garden gate was it at all likely that Varney who had come there for
concealment would pay any attention to the summons

After some consideration he did however think of a plan by which at
all events he could ensure effecting an entrance into the premises and
then he would take his chance of finding the mysterious being whom he
sought and who probably might have no particular objection to meeting
with him Charles Holland because their last interview in the ruins
could not be said to be otherwise than of a peaceable and calm enough
character

He saw by the board which was nailed in the front of the house that
all applications to see it were to be made to a Mr Nash residing close
at hand and as Charles had the appearance of a respectable person he
thought he might possibly have the key entrusted to him ostensibly to
look at the house preparatory possibly to taking it and so he should
at all events obtain admission

He accordingly went at once to this Mr Nash and asked about the
house of course he had to affect an interest in its rental and
accommodations which he did not feel in order to lull any suspicion
and finally he said 

I should like to look over it if you will lend me the key which I will
shortly bring back to you

There was an evident hesitation about the agent when this proposal was
communicated by Charles Holland and he said 

I dare say sir you wonder that I don't say yes at once but the fact
is there came a gentleman here one day when I was out and got a key
for we have two to open the house from my wife and he never came back
again

That this was the means by which Varney the vampire had obtained the
key by the aid of which Charles had seen him effect so immediate an
entrance to the house there could be no doubt

How long ago were you served that trick he said

About two days ago sir

Well it only shows how when one person acts wrongly another is at
once suspected of a capability to do so likewise There is my name and
my address I should like rather to go alone to see the house because I
always fancy I can judge better by myself of the accommodation and I
can stay as long as I like and ascertain the sizes of all the rooms
without the disagreeable feeling upon my mind which no amount of
complaisance on your part could ever get me over that I was most
unaccountably detaining somebody from more important business of their
own

Oh I assure you sir said Mr Nash that I should not be at all
impatient But if you would rather go alone 

Indeed I would

Oh then sir there is the key A gentleman who leaves his name and
address of course we can have no objection to I only told you of what
happened sir in the mere way of conversation and I hope you won't
imagine for a moment that I meant to insinuate that you were going to
keep the key

Oh certainly not certainly not said Charles who was only too glad
to get the key upon any terms You are quite right and I beg you will
say no more about it I quite understand

He then walked off to the empty house again and proceeding to the
avenue he fitted the key to the lock and had the satisfaction of
finding the gate instantly yield to him

When he passed through it and closed the door after him which he did
carefully he found himself in a handsomely laid-out garden and saw the
house a short distance in front of him standing upon a well got-up
lawn

He cared not if Varney should see him before he reached the house
because the fact was sufficiently evident to himself that after all he
could not actually enforce an interview with the vampire He only hoped
that as he had found him out it would be conceded to him

He therefore walked up the lawn without making the least attempt at
concealment and when he reached the house he allowed his footsteps to
make what noise they would upon the stone steps which led up to it But
no one appeared nor was there either by sight or by sound any
indication of the presence of any living being in the place besides
himself

Insensibly as he contemplated the deserted place around him the solemn
sort of stillness began to have its effect upon his imagination and
without being aware that he did so he had with softness and caution
glided onwards as if he were bent on some errand requiring the utmost
amount of caution and discrimination in the conduction of it

And so he entered the hall of the house where he stood some time and
listened with the greatest attention without however being able to
hear the least sound throughout the whole of the house

And yet he must be here thought Charles to himself I was not gone
many minutes and it is extremely unlikely that in so short a space of
time he has left after taking so much trouble by making such a detour
around the meadows to get here without being observed I will examine
every room in the place but I will find him

Charles immediately commenced going from room to room of that house in
his search for the vampire There were but four apartments upon the
ground floor and these of course he quickly ran through Nothing
whatever at all indicative of any one having been there met his gaze
and with a feeling of disappointment creeping over him he commenced the
ascent of the staircase

The day had now fairly commenced so that there was abundance of light
although even for the country it was an early hour and probably Mr
Nash had been not a little surprised to have a call from one whose
appearance bespoke no necessity for rising with the lark at such an
hour

All these considerations however sank into insignificance in Charles's
mind compared with the object he had in view namely the unravelling
the many mysteries that hung around that man He ascended to the landing
of the first story and then as he could have no choice he opened the
first door that his eyes fell upon and entered a tolerably large
apartment It was quite destitute of furniture and at the moment
Charles was about to pronounce it empty but then his eyes fell upon a
large black-looking bundle of something that seemed to be lying jammed
up under the window on the floor that being the place of all others in
the room which was enveloped in the most shadow

He started back involuntarily at the moment for the appearance was one
so shapeless that there was no such thing as defining from even that
distance what it really was

Then he slowly and cautiously approached it as we always approach that
of the character of which we are ignorant and concerning the powers of
which to do injury we can consequently have no defined idea

That it was a human form there was the first tangible opinion he had
about it and from its profound stillness and the manner in which it
seemed to be laid close under the window he thought that he was surely
upon the point of finding out that some deed of blood had been
committed the unfortunate victim of which was now lying before him

Upon a nearer examination he found that the whole body including the
greater part of the head and face was wrapped in a large cloak and
there as he gazed he soon found cause to correct his first opinion at
to the form belonging to the dead for he could distinctly hear the
regular breathing as of some one in a sound and dreamless sleep

Closer he went and closer still Then as he clasped his hands he
said in a voice scarcely above a whisper 

It is it is the vampire

Yes there could be no doubt of the fact It was Sir Francis Varney who
lay there enveloped in the huge horseman's cloak in which on two or
three occasions during the progress of this narrative he had figured
There he lay at the mercy completely of any arm that might be raised
against him apparently so overcome by fatigue that no ordinary noise
would have awakened him

Well might Charles Holland gaze at him with mingled feelings There lay
the being who had done almost enough to drive the beautiful Flora
Bannerworth distracted the being who had compelled the Bannerworth
family to leave their ancient house to which they had been bound by
every description of association The same mysterious existence too
who the better to carry on his plots and plans had by dint of
violence immured him Charles in a dungeon and loaded him with
chains There he lay sleeping and at his mercy

Shall I awaken him said Charles or let him sleep off the fatigue
which no doubt is weighing down his limbs and setting heavily on his
eyelids No my business with him is too urgent

He then raised his voice and cried 

Varney Varney awake

The sound disturbed without altogether breaking up the deep slumber of
the vampire and he uttered a low moan and moved one hand restlessly
Then as if that disturbance of the calm and deep repose which had sat
upon him had given at once the reins to fancy he begin to mutter
strange words in his sleep some of which could be heard by Charles
distinctly while others were too incoherently uttered to be clearly
understood

Where is it he said where where hidden Pull the house
down Murder No no no no murder I will not I dare not Blood
enough is upon my hands The money the money Down villains down
down down

What these incoherent words alluded to specifically Charles of course
could not have the least idea but he listened attentively with a hope
that something might fall from his lips that would afford a key to some
of the mysterious circumstances with which he was so intimately
connected

Now however there was a longer silence than before only broken
occasionally by low moans but suddenly as Charles was thinking of
again speaking he uttered some more disjointed sentences

No harm he said no harm Marchdale is a villain Not a hair of
his head injured no no Set him free yes I will set him free
Beware beware Marchdale and you Mortimer The scaffold ay the
scaffold but where is the bright gold The memory of the deed of blood
will not cling to it Where is it hidden The gold the gold the gold
It is not in the grave it cannot be there no no no not there not
there Load the pistols There there Down villain down down
down

Despairing now of obtaining anything like tangible information from
these ravings which even if they did by accident so connect
themselves together as to seem to mean something Charles again cried
aloud 

Varney awake awake

But as before the sleeping man was sufficiently deaf to the cry to
remain with his eyes closed still in a disturbed slumber but yet a
slumber which might last for a considerable time

I have heard said Charles that there are many persons whom no noise
will awaken while the slightest touch rouses them in an instant I will
try that upon this slumbering being

As he spoke he advanced close to Sir Francis Varney and touched him
slightly with the toe of his boot

The effect was as startling as it was instantaneous The vampire sprang
to his feet as he had been suddenly impelled up by some powerful
machinery and casting his cloak away from his arms so as to have them
at liberty he sprang upon Charles Holland and hurled him to the
ground where he held him with a giant's gripe as he cried 

Rash fool be you whom you may Why have you troubled me to rid the
world of your intrusive existence

The attack was so sudden and so terrific that resistance to it even if
Charles had had the power was out of the question All he could say
was 

Varney Varney do you not know me I am Charles Holland Will you now
in your mad rage take the life you might more easily have taken when I
lay in the dungeon from which you released me

The sound of his voice at once convinced Sir Francis Varney of his
identity and it was with a voice that had some tones of regret in it
that he replied 

And wherefore have you thought proper when you were once free and
unscathed to cast yourself into such a position of danger as to follow
me to my haunt

I contemplated no danger said Charles because I contemplated no
evil I do not know why you should kill me

You came here and yet you say you do not know why I should kill you
Young man have you a dozen lives that you can afford to tamper with
them thus I have at much chance of imminence to myself already once
saved you when another with a sterner feeling would have gladly taken
your life but now as if you were determined to goad me to an act which
I have shunned committing you will not let me close my eyes in peace

Take your hand from off my throat Varney and I will then tell you
what brought me here

Sir Francis Varney did so

Rise he said rise I have seen blood enough to be sickened at the
prospect of more but you should not have come here and tempted me

Nay believe me I came here for good and not for evil Sir Francis
Varney hear me out and then judge for yourself whether you can blame
the perseverance which enabled me to find out this secret place of
refuge but let me first say that now it is as good a place of
concealment to you as before it was for I shall not betray you

Go on go on What is it you desire

During the long and weary hours of my captivity I thought deeply and
painfully too as may be well imagined of all the circumstances
connected with your appearance at Bannerworth Hall and your subsequent
conduct Then I felt convinced that there was something far more than
met the eye in the whole affair and from what I have been informed of
since I am the more convinced that some secret some mystery which it
is in your power only perhaps to explain lurks at the bottom of all
your conduct

Well proceed said Varney

Have I not said enough now to enable you to divine the object of my
visit It is that you should shake off the trammels of mystery in which
you have shrouded yourself and declare what it is you want what it is
you desire that has induced you to set yourself up as such a determined
foe of the Bannerworth family

And that you say is the modest request that brings you here

You speak as if you thought it was idle curiosity that prompts me but
you know it is not Your language and manner are those of a man of too
much sagacity not to see that I have higher notions

Name them

You have yourself in more than one instance behaved with a strange
sort of romantic generosity as if but for some great object which you
felt impelled to seek by any means and at any sacrifice you would be a
something in character and conduct very different from what you are One
of my objects then is to awaken that better nature which is slumbering
within you only now and then rousing itself to do some deed which
should be the character of all your actions for your own sake I have
come

But not wholly

Not wholly as you say There is another than whom the whole world is
not so dear to me That other one was serene as she was beautiful
Happiness danced in her eyes and she ought for not more lovely is the
mind that she possesses than the glorious form that enshrines it to be
happy Her life should have passed like one long summer's day of beauty
sunshine and pure heavenly enjoyment You have poisoned the cup of joy
that the great God of nature had permitted her to place to her lips and
taste of mistrustingly Why have you done this I ask you why have you
done this

Have you said all that you came to say

I have spoken the substance of my message Much could I elaborate upon
such a theme but it is not one Varney which is congenial to my heart
for your sake however and for the sakes of those whom I hold most
dear let me implore you to act in this matter with a kindly
consideration Proclaim your motives you cannot say that they are not
such as we may aid you in

Varney was silent for several moments he seemed perceptibly moved by
the manner of the young man as well as by the matter of his discourse
In fact one would suppose that Charles Holland had succeeded in
investing what he said with some sort of charm that won much upon the
fancy of Sir Francis Varney for when he ceased to speak the latter
said in a low voice 

Go on go on you have surely much more to say

No Varney I have said enough and not thus much would I have said had
I not been aware most certainly and truly aware without the shadow of
a doubt by your manner that you were most accessible to human
feeling

I accessible to human feeling know you to whom you speak Am I not he
before whom all men shudder whose name has been a terror and a
desolation and yet you can talk of my human feelings Nay if I had had
any be sure they would have been extinguished by the persecutions I
have endured from those who you know with savage ferocity have sought
my life

No Varney I give you credit for being a subtler reasoner than thus to
argue you know well that you were the aggressor to those parties who
sought your life you know well that with the greatest imaginable pains
you held yourself up to them as a thing of great terror

I did I did

You cannot then turn round upon ignorant persons and blame them
because your exertions to make yourself seem what you wish were but too
successful

You use the word seem said Varney with a bitterness of aspect as
if you would imply a doubt that I am that which thousands by their
fears would testify me to be

Thousands might said Charles Holland but not among them am I
Varney I will not be made the victim of superstition Were you to enact
before my very eyes some of those feats which to the senses of others
would stamp you as the preternatural being you assume to be I would
doubt the evidence of my own senses ere I permitted such a bugbear to
oppress my brain

Go said Sir Francis Varney go I have no more words for you I have
nothing to relate to you

Nay you have already listened sufficiently to me to give me a hope
that I had awakened some of the humanity that was in your nature Do
not Sir Francis Varney crush that hope even as it was budding forth
not for my own sake do I ask you for revelations that may
perhaps must be painful for you but for the sake of Flora Bannerworth
to whom you owe abundance of reparation

No no

In the name of all that is great and good and just I call upon you
for justice

What have I to do with such an invocation Utter such a sentiment to
men who like yourself are invested with the reality as well as the
outward show of human nature

Nay Sir Francis Varney now you belie yourself You have passed
through a long and perchance a stormy life Can you look back upon
your career and find no reminiscences of the past that shall convince
you that you are of the great family of man and have had abundance of
human feelings and of human affections

Peace peace

Nay Sir Francis Varney I will take your word and if you will lay
your hand upon your heart and tell me truly that you never felt what it
was to love to have all feeling all taste and all hope of future joy
concentrated in one individual I will despair and leave you If you
will tell me that never in your whole life you have felt for any fair
and glorious creature as I now feel for Flora Bannerworth a being for
whom you could have sacrificed not only existence but all the hopes of
a glorious future that bloom around it if you will tell me with the
calm dispassionate aspect of truth that you have held yourself aloof
from such human feelings I will no longer press you to a disclosure
which I shall bring no argument to urge

The agitation of Sir Francis Varney's countenance was perceptible and
Charles Holland was about to speak again when striking him upon the
breast with his clinched hand the vampire checked him saying 

Do you wish to drive me mad that you thus from memory's hidden cells
conjure up images of the past

Then there are such images to conjure up there are such shadows only
sleeping but which require only as you did even now but a touch to
awaken them to life and energy Oh Sir Francis Varney do not tell me
that you are not human

The vampire made a furious gesture as if he would have attacked Charles
Holland but then he sank nearly to the floor as if soul-stricken by
some recollection that unnerved his arm he shook with unwonted emotion
and from the frightful livid aspect of his countenance Charles dreaded
some serious accession of indisposition which might if nothing else
did prevent him from making the revelation he so much sought to hear
from his lips

Varney he cried Varney be calm you will be listened to by one who
will draw no harsh no hasty conclusions by one who with that
charity I grieve to say is rare will place upon the words you utter
the most favourable construction Tell me all I pray you tell me all

This is strange said the vampire I never thought that aught human
could thus have moved me Young man you have touched the chords of
memory they vibrate throughout my heart producing cadences and sounds
of years long past Bear with me awhile

And you will speak to me

I will

Having your promise then I am content Varney

But you must be secret not even in the wildest waste of nature where
you can well presume that naught but Heaven can listen to your
whisperings must you utter one word of that which I shall tell to you

Alas said Charles I dare not take such a confidence I have said
that it is not for myself I seek such knowledge of what you are and
what you have been but it is for another so dear to me that all the
charms of life that make up other men's delights equal not the witchery
of one glance from her speaking as it does of the glorious light from
that Heaven which is eternal from whence she sprung

And you reject my communication said Varney because I will not give
you leave to expose it to Flora Bannerworth

It must be so

And you are most anxious to hear that which I have to relate

Most anxious indeed indeed most anxious

Then have I found in that scruple which besets your mind a better
argument for trusting you than had ye been loud in protestation Had
your promises of secrecy been but those which come from the lip and not
from the heart my confidence would not have been rejected on such
grounds I think that I dare trust you

With leave to tell to Flora that which you shall communicate

You may whisper it to her but to no one else without my special leave
and licence

I agree to those terms and will religiously preserve them

I do not doubt you for one moment and now I will tell to you what
never yet has passed my lips to mortal man Now will I connect together
some matters which you may have heard piecemeal from others

What others are they

Dr Chillingworth and he who once officiated as a London hangman

I have heard something from those quarters

Listen then to me and you shall better understand that which you have
heard Some years ago it matters not the number on a stormy night
towards the autumn of the year two men sat alone in poverty and that
species of distress which beset the haughty profligate daring man who
has been accustomed all his life to its most enticing enjoyments but
never to that industry which alone ought to produce them and render
them great and magnificent

Two men and who were they

I was one Look upon me I was of those men and strong and evil
passions were battling in my heart

And the other

Was Marmaduke Bannerworth

Gracious Heaven the father of her whom I adore the suicide

Yes the same that man stained with a thousand vices blasted by a
thousand crimes the father of her who partakes nothing of his nature
who borrows nothing from his memory but his name was the man who there
sat with me plotting and contriving how by fraud or violence we were
to lead our usual life of revelry and wild audacious debauch

Go on go on believe me I am deeply interested

I can see as much We were not nice in the various schemes which our
prolific fancies engendered If trickery and the false dice at the
gaming-table sufficed not to fill our purses we were bold enough for
violence If simple robbery would not succeed we could take a life

Murder

Ay call it by its proper name a murder We sat till the midnight hour
had passed without arriving at a definite conclusion we saw no plan of
practicable operation and so we wandered onwards to one of those deep
dens of iniquity a gaming-house wherein we had won and lost thousands

We had no money but we staked largely in the shape of a wager upon
the success of one of the players we knew not or cared not for the
consequence if we had lost but as it happened we were largely
successful and beggars as we had walked into that place we might have
left it independent men

But when does the gambler know when to pause in his career If defeat
awakens all the raging passions of humanity within his bosom success
but feeds the great vice that has been there engendered To the dawn of
morn we played the bright sun shone in and yet we played the midday
came and went the stimulant of wine supported us and still we played
then came the shadows of evening stealing on in all their beauty But
what were they to us amid those mutations of fortune which at one
moment made us princes and placed palaces at our control and at
another debased us below the veriest beggar that craves the stinted
alms of charity from door to door

And there was one man who from the first to the last stayed by us
like a very fiend more than man I thought he was not human We won of
all but of him People came and brought their bright red gold and laid
it down before us but for us to take it up and then by a cruel stroke
of fortune he took it from us

The night came on we won and he won of us the clock struck
twelve we were beggars God knows what was he

We saw him place his winnings about his person we saw the smile that
curved the corners of his lips he was calm and we were maddened The
blood flowed temperately through his veins but in ours it was burning
lava scorching as it went through every petty artery and drying up all
human thought all human feeling

The winner left and we tracked his footsteps When he reached the open
air although he had taken much less than we of the intoxicating
beverages that are supplied gratis to those who frequent those haunts of
infamy it was evident that some sort of inebriation attacked him his
steps were disordered and unsteady and as we followed him we could
perceive by the devious track that he took that he was somewhat
uncertain of his route

We had no fixed motive in so pursuing this man It was but an impulsive
proceeding at the best but as he still went on and cleared the streets
getting into the wild and open country and among the hedge-rows we
began to whisper together and to think that what we did not owe to
fortune we might to our own energy and courage at such a moment

I need not hesitate to say so since to hide the most important
feature of my revelation from you would be but to mock you we resolved
upon robbing him

And was that all

It was all that our resolution went to We were not anxious to spill
blood but still we were resolved that we would accomplish our purpose
even if it required murder for its consummation Have you heard enough

I have not heard enough although I guess the rest

You may well guess it from its preface He turned down a lonely
pathway which had we chosen it ourselves could not have been more
suitable for the attack we meditated

There were tall trees on either side and a hedge-row stretching high
up between them We knew that that lane led to a suburban village
which without a doubt was the object of his destination

Then Marmaduke Bannerworth spoke saying 

'What we have to do must be done now or never There needs not two in
this adventure Shall you or I require him to refund what he has won
from us'

'I care not I said but if we are to accomplish our purpose without
arousing even a shadow of resistance it is better to show him its
futility by both appearing and take a share in the adventure'

This was agreed upon and we hastened forward He heard footsteps
pursuing him and quickened his pace I was the fleetest runner and
overtook him I passed him a pace or two and then turning I faced him
and impeded his progress

The lane was narrow and a glance behind him showed him Marmaduke
Bannerworth so that he was hemmed in between two enemies and could
move neither to the right nor to the left on account of the thick
brushwood that intervened between the trees

Then with an assumed courage that sat but ill upon him he demanded
of us what we wanted and proclaimed his right to pass despite the
obstruction we placed in his way

The dialogue was brief I being foremost spoke to him

'Your money I said your winnings at the gaming-table We cannot
and we will not lose it'

So suddenly that he had nearly taken my life he drew a pistol from
his pocket and levelling it at my head he fired upon me

Perhaps had I moved it might have been my death but as it was the
bullet furrowed my cheek leaving a scar the path of which is yet
visible in a white cicatrix

I felt a stunning sensation and thought myself a dead man I cried
aloud to Marmaduke Bannerworth and he rushed forward I knew not that
he was armed and that he had the power about him to do the deed which
he then accomplished but there was a groan a slight struggle and the
successful gamester fell upon the green sward bathed in his blood

And this is the father of her whom I adore

It is Are you shocked to think of such a neat relationship between so
much beauty and intelligence and a midnight murderer Is your philosophy
so poor that the daughter's beauty suffers from the commission of a
father's crime

No no It is not so Do not fancy that for one moment I can
entertain such unworthy opinions The thought that crossed me was that I
should have to tell one of such a gentle nature that her father had done
such a deed

On that head you can use your own discretion The deed was done there
was sufficient light for us to look upon the features of the dying man
Ghastly and terrific they glared upon us while the glazed eyes as they
were upturned to the bright sky seemed appealing to Heaven for
vengeance against us for having done the deed

Many a day and many an hour since at all times and all seasons I have
seen those eyes with the glaze of death upon them following me and
gloating over the misery they had the power to make I think I see them
now

Indeed

Yes look look see how they glare upon me with what a fixed and
frightful stare the bloodshot pupils keep their place there there oh
save me from such a visitation again It is too horrible I dare not I
cannot endure it and yet why do you gaze at me with such an aspect
dread visitant You know that it was not my hand that did the deed who
laid you low You know that not to me are you able to lay the heavy
charge of your death

Varney you look upon vacancy said Charles Holland

No no vacancy it may be to you but to me tis full of horrible
shapes

Compose yourself you have taken me far into your confidence already I
pray you now to tell me all I have in my brain no room for horrible
conjectures such as those which might else torment me

Varney was silent for a few minutes and then he wiped from his brow the
heavy drops of perspiration that had there gathered and heaved a deep
sigh

Speak to me added Charles nothing will so much relieve you from the
terrors of this remembrance as making a confidence which reflection will
approve of and which you will know that you have no reason to repent

Charles Holland said Varney I have already gone too far to
retract much too far I know and can well understand all the danger of
half confidence You already know so much that it is fit you should
know more

Go on then Varney I will listen to you

I know not if at this juncture I can command myself to say more I
feel that what next has to be told will be most horrible for me to
tell most sad for you to hear told

I can well believe Varney from your manner of speech and from the
words you use that you have some secret to relate beyond this simple
fact of the murder of this gamester by Marmaduke Bannerworth

You are right such is the fact the death of that man could not have
moved me as you now see me moved There is a secret connected with his
fate which I may well hesitate to utter a secret even to whisper to the
winds of heaven I although I did not do the deed no no I I did not
strike the blow not I not I

Illustration

Varney it is astonishing to me the pains you take to assure yourself
of your innocence of this deed no one accuses you but still were it
not that I am impressed with a strong conviction that you're speaking to
me nothing but the truth the very fact of your extreme anxiety to
acquit yourself would engender suspicion

I can understand that feeling Charles Holland I can fully understand
it I do not blame you for it it is a most natural one but when you
know all you will feel with me how necessary it must have been to my
peace to seize upon every trivial circumstance that can help me to a
belief in my own innocence

It may be so as yet you well know I speak in ignorance But what
could there have been in the character of that gambler that has made
you so sympathetic concerning his decease

Nothing nothing whatever in his character He was a bad man not one
of those free open spirits which are seduced into crime by
thoughtlessness not one of those whom we pity perchance more than we
condemn but a man without a redeeming trait in his disposition a man
so heaped up with vices and iniquities that society gained much by his
decease and not an individual could say that he had lost a friend

And yet the mere thought of the circumstances connected with his death
seems almost to drive you to the verge of despair

You are right the mere thought has that effect

You have aroused all my curiosity to know the causes of such a
feeling

Varney paced the apartment in silence for many minutes He seemed to be
enduring a great mental struggle and at length when he turned to
Charles Holland and spoke there were upon his countenance traces of
deep emotion

I have said young man that I will take you into my confidence I have
said that I will clear up many seeming mysteries and that I will enable
you to understand what was obscure in the narrative of Dr
Chillingworth and of that man who filled the office of public
executioner and who has haunted me so long

It is true then as the doctor states that you were executed in
London

I was

And resuscitated by the galvanic process put into operation by Dr
Chillingworth

As he supposed but there are truths connected with natural philosophy
which he dreamed not of I bear a charmed life and it was but accident
which produced a similar effect upon the latent springs of my existence
in the house to which the executioner conducted me to what would have
been produced had I been sufficed in the free and open air to wait
until the cool moonbeams fell upon me

Varney Varney said Charles Holland you will not succeed in
convincing me of your supernatural powers I hold such feelings and
sensations at arm's length I will not I cannot assume you to be what
you affect

I ask for no man's belief I know that which I know and gathering
experience from the coincidences of different phenomena I am compelled
to arrive at certain conclusions Believe what you please doubt what
you please but I say again that I am not as other men

I am in no condition to depute your proposition I wish not to dispute
it but you are wandering Varney from the point I wait anxiously for
a continuation of your narrative

I know that I am wandering from it I know well that I am wandering
from it and that the reason I do so is that I dread that continuation

That dread will nor be the less for its postponement

You are right but tell me Charles Holland although you are young you
have been about in the great world sufficiently to form correct
opinions and to understand that which is related to you drawing proper
deductions from certain facts and arriving possibly at more correct
conclusions than some of maturer years with less wisdom

I will freely answer Varney any question you may put to me

I know it tell me then what measure of guilt you attach to me in the
transaction I have noticed to you

It seems then to me that not contemplating the man's murder you
cannot be accused of the act although a set of fortuitous circumstances
made you appear an accomplice to its commission

You think I may be acquitted

You can acquit yourself knowing that you did not contemplate the
murder

I did not contemplate it I know not what desperate deed I should have
stopped short at then in the height of my distress but I neither
contemplated taking that man's life nor did I strike the blow which
sent him from existence

There is even some excuse as regards the higher crime for Marmaduke
Bannerworth

Think you so

Yes he thought that you were killed and impulsively he might have
struck the blow that made him a murderer

Be it so I am willing extremely willing that anything should occur
that should remove the odium of guilt from any man Be it so I say
with all my heart but now Charles Holland I feel that we must meet
again ere I can tell you all but in the meantime let Flora Bannerworth
rest in peace she need dread nothing from me Avarice and revenge the
two passions which found a home in my heart are now stifled for ever

Revenge did you say revenge

I did whence the marvel am I not sufficiently human for that

But you coupled it with the name of Flora Bannerworth

I did and that is part of my mystery

A mystery indeed to imagine that such a being as Flora could awaken
any such feeling in your heart a most abundant mystery

It is so I do not affect to deny it but yet it is true although so
greatly mysterious but tell her that although at one time I looked upon
her as one whom I cared not if I injured her beauty and distress
changed the current of my thoughts and won upon me greatly From the
moment I found I had the power to become the bane of her existence I
ceased to wish to be so and never again shall she experience a pang of
alarm from Varney the vampire

Your message shall be faithfully delivered and doubt not that it will
be received with grateful feelings Nevertheless I should have much
wished to have been in a position to inform her of more particulars

Come to me here at midnight to-morrow and you shall know all I will
have no reservation with you no concealments you shall know whom I
have had to battle against and how it is that a world of evil passions
took possession of my heart and made me what I am

Are you firm in this determination Varney will you indeed tell me no
more to-night

No more I have said it Leave me now I have need of more repose for
of late sleep has seldom closed my eyelids

Charles Holland was convinced from the positive manner in which he
spoke that nothing more in the shape of information at that time was
to be expected from Varney and being fearful that if he urged this
strange being too far at a time when he did not wish it he might
refuse all further communication he thought it prudent to leave him so
he said to him 

Be assured Varney I shall keep the appointment you have made with an
expectation when we do meet of being rewarded by a recital of some full
particulars

You shall not be disappointed farewell farewell

Charles Holland bade him adieu and left the place

Although he had now acquired all the information he hoped to take away
with him when Varney first began to be communicative yet when he came
to consider how strange and unaccountable a being he had been in
communication with Charles could not but congratulate himself that he
had heard so much for from the manner of Varney he could well suppose
that that was indeed the first time he had been so communicative upon
subjects which evidently held so conspicuous a place in his heart

And he had abundance of hope likewise from what had been said by
Varney that he would keep his word and communicate to him fully all
else that he required to know and when he recollected those words which
Varney had used signifying that he knew the danger of half confidences
that hope grew into a certainty and Charles began to have no doubt but
that on the next evening all that was mysterious in the various affairs
connected with the vampire would become clear and open to the light of
day

He strolled down the lane in which the lone house was situated
revolving these matters in his mind and when he arrived at its
entrance he was rather surprised to see a throng of persons hastily
moving onward with come appearance of dismay about them and anxiety
depicted upon their countenances

He stopped a lad and inquired of him the cause of the seeming tumult

Why sir the fact is said the boy a crowd from the town's been
burning down Bannerworth Hall and they've killed a man

Bannerworth Hall you must be mistaken

Well sir I ought not to call it Bannerworth Hall because I mean the
old ruins in the neighbourhood that are supposed to have been originally
Bannerworth Hall before the house now called such was built and
moreover as the Bannerworths have always had a garden there and two or
three old sheds the people in the town called it Bannerworth Hall in
common with the other building

I understand And do you say that all have been destroyed

Yes sir All that was capable of being burnt has been burnt and what
is more a man has been killed among the ruins We don't know who he is
but the folks said he was a vampire and they left him for dead

When will these terrible outrages cease Oh Varney Varney you have
much to answer for even if in your conscience you succeed in acquitting
yourself of the murder some of the particulars concerning which you
have informed me of




 LXXXIII

THE MYSTERIOUS ARRIVAL AT THE INN THE HUNGARIAN NOBLEMAN THE LETTER
TO VARNEY


Illustration

While these affairs are proceeding and when there seems every
appearance of Sir Francis Varney himself quickly putting an end to some
of the vexatious circumstances connected with himself and the
Bannerworth family it is necessary that we should notice an occurrence
which took place at the same inn which the admiral had made such a scene
of confusion upon the occasion of his first arrival in the town

Not since the admiral had arrived with Jack Pringle and so disturbed
the whole economy of the household was there so much curiosity excited
as on the morning following the interview which Charles Holland had had
with Varney the vampire

The inn was scarcely opened when a stranger arrived mounted on a
coal-black horse and alighting he surrendered the bridle into the
hands of a boy who happened to be at the inn-door and stalked slowly
and solemnly into the building

He was tall and of a cadaverous aspect in attire he was plainly
apparelled but there was no appearance of poverty about him on the
contrary what he really had on was of a rich and costly character
although destitute of ornament

He sat down in the first room that presented itself and awaited the
appearance of the landlord who upon being informed that a guest of
apparently ample means and of some consequence had entered the place
hastily went to him to receive his commands

With a profusion of bows our old friend who had been so obsequious to
Admiral Bell entered the room and begged to know what orders the
gentleman had for him

I presume said the stranger in a deep solemn voice I presume that
you have no objection for a few days that I shall remain in this town
to board and lodge me for a certain price which you can name to me at
once

Certainly sir said the landlord any way you please without wine
sir I presume

As you please make your own arrangements

Well sir as we can't tell of course what wine a gentleman may
drink but when we come to consider breakfast dinner tea and supper
and a bed and all that sort of thing and a private sitting-room I
suppose sir

Certainly

You would not then think sir a matter of four guineas a week will
be too much perhaps

I told you to name your own charge Let it be four guineas if you had
said eight I should have paid it

Good God said the publican here's a damned fool that I am I beg
your pardon sir I didn't mean you Now I could punch my own head will
you have breakfast at once sir and then we shall begin regular you
know sir

Have what

Breakfast breakfast you know sir tea coffee cocoa or chocolate
ham eggs or a bit of grilled fowl cold sirloin of roast beef or a
red herring anything you like sir

I never take breakfast so you may spare yourself the trouble of
providing anything for me

Not take breakfast sir not take breakfast Would you like to take
anything to drink then sir People say it's an odd time at eight
o'clock in the morning to drink but for my part I always have
thought that you couldn't begin a good thing too soon

I live upon drink said the stranger but you have none in the cellar
that will suit me

Indeed sir

No no I am certain

Why we've got some claret now sir said the landlord

Which may look like blood and yet not be it

Like what sir damn my rags

Begone begone

The stranger uttered these words so peremptorily that the landlord
hastily left the room and going into his own bar he gave himself so
small a tap on the side of the head that it would not have hurt a fly
as he said 

I could punch myself into bits I could tear my hair out by the roots
and then he pulled a little bit of his hair so gently and tenderly that
it showed what a man of discretion he was even in the worst of all his
agony of passion

The idea he added of a fellow coming here paying four guineas a
week for board and lodging telling me he would not have minded eight
and then not wanting any breakfast it's enough to aggravate half a
dozen saints but what an odd fish he looks

At this moment the ostler came in and standing at the bar he wiped
his mouth with his sleeve as he said 

I suppose you'll stand a quart for that master

A quart for what you vagabond A quart because I've done myself up in
heaps a quart because I'm fit to pull myself into fiddlestrings

No said the ostler because I've just put up the gentleman's horse

What gentleman's horse

Why the big-looking fellow with the white face now in the parlour

What did he come on a horse Sam What sort of a looking creature is
it you may judge of a man from the sort of horse-company he keeps

Well then sir I hardly know It's coal black and looks as knowing
as possible it's tried twice to get a kick at me but I was down upon
him and put the bucket in his way Howsomdever I don't think it's a
bad animal as a animal mind you sir though a little bit wicious or
so

Well said the publican as he drew the ostler half a pint instead of
a quart you're always drinking take that

Blow me said the ostler half a pint master

Plague take you I can't stand parleying with you there's the parlour
bell perhaps after all he will have some breakfast

While the landlord was away the ostler helped himself to a quart of the
strongest ale which by a singular faculty that he had acquired he
poured down his throat without any effort at swallowing holding his
head back and the jug at a little distance from his mouth

Having accomplished this feat he reversed the jug giving it a knowing
tap with his knuckles as though he would have signified to all the world
that it was empty and that he had accomplished what he desired

In the meantime the landlord had made his way to his strange guest who
said to him when he came into the room

Is there not one Sir Francis Varney residing in this town

The devil thought the landlord this is another of them I'll bet a
guinea Sir Francis Varney sir did you say Why sir there was a Sir
Francis Varney but folks seem to think as how he's no better than he
should be a sort of vampire sir if you know what that is

I have certainly heard of such things but can you not tell me
Varney's address I wish to see him

Well then sir I cannot tell it to you for there's really been such
a commotion and such a riot about him that he's taken himself off I
think altogether and we can hear nothing of him Lord bless you sir
they burnt down his house and hunted him about so that I don't think
that he'll ever show his face here again

And cannot you tell me where he was seen last

That I cannot sir but if anybody knows anything about him it's Mr
Henry Bannerworth or perhaps Dr Chillingworth for they have had more
to do with him than anybody else

Indeed and can you tell me the address of the former individual

That I can't sir for the Bannerworths have left the Hall As for the
doctor sir you'll see his house in the High-street with a large brass
plate on the door so that you cannot mistake it It's No  on the
other side of the way

I thank you for so much information said the stranger and rising he
walked to the door Before however he left he turned and
added You can say if you should by chance meet Mr Bannerworth that
a Hungarian nobleman wishes to speak to him concerning Sir Francis
Varney the vampire

A what sir

A nobleman from Hungary was the reply

The deuce said the landlord as he looked after him He don't seem
at all hungry here not thirsty neither What does he mean by a nobleman
from Hungary The idea of a man talking about hungry and not taking any
breakfast He's queering me I'll be hanged if I'll stand it Here I
clearly lose four guineas a week and then get made game of besides A
nobleman indeed I think I see him Why he isn't quite so big as old
Slaney the butcher It's a do I'll have at him when he comes back

Meanwhile the unconscious object of this soliloquy passed down the
High-street until he came to Dr Chillingworth's at whose door he
knocked

Now Mrs Chillingworth had been waiting the whole night for the return
of the doctor who had not yet made his appearance and consequently
that lady's temper had become acidulated to an uncommon extent and when
she heard a knock at the door something possessed her that it could be
no other than her spouse and she prepared to give him that warm
reception which she considered he had a right as a married man to
expect after such conduct

She hurriedly filled a tolerably sized hand-basin with not the cleanest
water in the world and then opening the door hurriedly with one hand
she slouced the contents into the face of the intruder exclaiming 

Now you've caught it

D n said the Hungarian nobleman and then Mrs Chillingworth uttered
a scream for she feared she had made a mistake

Oh sir I'm very sorry but I thought it was my husband

But if you did said the stranger there was no occasion to drown him
with a basin of soap-suds It is your husband I want madam if he be
Dr Chillingworth

Then indeed you must go on wanting him sir for he's not been to his
own home for a day and a night He takes up all his time in hunting
after that beastly vampire

Ah Sir Francis Varney you mean

I do and I'd Varney him if I caught hold of him

Can you give me the least idea of where he can be found

Of course I can

Indeed where said the stranger eagerly

In some churchyard to be sure gobbling up the dead bodies

With this Mrs Chillingworth shut the door with a bang that nearly
flattened the Hungarian's nose with his face and he was fain to walk
away quite convinced that there was no information to be had in that
quarter

He returned to the inn and having told the landlord that he would give
a handsome reward to any one who would discover to him the retreat of
Sir Francis Varney he shut himself up in an apartment alone and was
busy for a time in writing letters

Although the sum which the stranger offered was an indefinite one the
landlord mentioned the matter across the bar to several persons but all
of them shook their heads believing it to be a very perilous adventure
indeed to have anything to do with so troublesome a subject as Sir
Francis Varney As the day advanced however a young lad presented
himself and asked to see the gentleman who had been inquiring for
Varney

The landlord severely questioned and cross-questioned him with the hope
of discovering if he had any information but the boy was quite
obdurate and would speak to no one but the person who had offered the
reward so that mine host was compelled to introduce him to the
Hungarian nobleman who as yet had neither eaten nor drunk in the
house

The boy wore upon his countenance the very expression of juvenile
cunning and when the stranger asked him if he really was in possession
of any information concerning the retreat of Sir Francis Varney he
said 

I can tell you where he is but what are you going to give

What sum do you require said the stranger

A whole half-crown

It is your's and if your information prove correct come to-morrow
and I'll add another to it always provided likewise you keep the
secret from any one else

Trust me for that said the boy I live with my grandmother she's
precious old and has got a cottage We sell milk and cakes sticky
stuff and pennywinkles

A goodly collection Go on

Well sir this morning there comes a man in with a bottle and he
buys a bottle full of milk and a loaf I saw him and I knew it was
Varney the vampire

You followed him

Of course I did sir and he's staying at the house that's to let down
the lane round the corner by Mr Biggs's and past Lee's garden
leaving old Slaney's stacks on your right hand and so cutting on till
you come to Grants's meadow when you'll see old Madhunter a brick-field
staring of you in the face and arter that 

Peace peace you shall yourself conduct me Come to this place at
sunset be secret and probably ten times the reward you have already
received may be yours said the stranger

What ten half-crowns

Yes I will keep my word with you

What a go I know what I'll do I'll set up as a show man and what a
glorious treat it will be to peep through one of the holes all day
myself and get somebody to pull the strings up and down and when I'm
tired of that I can blaze away upon the trumpet like one o'clock I
think I see me Here you sees the Duke of Marlborough a whopping of
everybody and here you see the Frenchmen flying about like parched peas
in a sifter




 LXXXIV

THE EXCITED POPULACE VARNEY HUNTED THE PLACE OF REFUGE


Illustration

There seemed now a complete lull in the proceedings as connected with
Varney the vampire We have reason to believe that the executioner who
had been as solicitous as Varney to obtain undisputed possession of
Bannerworth Hall has fallen a victim to the indiscriminating rage of
the mob Varney himself is a fugitive and bound by the most solemn ties
to Charles Holland not only to communicate to him such particulars of
the past as will bring satisfaction to his mind but to abstain from
any act which for the future shall exercise a disastrous influence
upon the happiness of Flora

The doctor and the admiral with Henry had betaken themselves from the
Hall as we had recorded and in due time reached the cottage where
Flora and her mother had found a temporary refuge

Mrs Bannerworth was up but Flora was sleeping and although the
tidings they had to tell were of a curious and mixed nature they would
not have her disturbed to listen to them

And likewise they were rather pleased than otherwise since they knew
not exactly what had become of Charles Holland to think that they would
probably be spared the necessity of saying they could not account for
his absence

That he had gone upon some expedition probably dangerous and so one
which he did not wish to communicate the particulars of to his friends
lest they should make a strong attempt to dissuade him from it they
were induced to believe

But yet they had that confidence in his courage and active intellectual
resources to believe that he would come through it unscathed and
probably shortly show himself at the cottage

In this hope they were not disappointed for in about two hours Charles
made his appearance but until he began to be questioned concerning his
absence by the admiral he scarcely considered the kind of dilemma he
had put himself into by the promise of secrecy he had given to Varney
and was a little puzzled to think how much he might tell and how much
he was bound in honour to conceal

Avast there cried the admiral what's become of your tongue
Charles You've been on some cruize I'll be bound Haul over the ship's
books and tell us what's happened

I have been upon an adventure said Charles which I hope will be
productive of beneficial results to us all but the fact is I have
made a promise perhaps incautiously that I will not communicate what I
know

Whew said the admiral that's awkward but however if a man said
under sealed instructions there's an end of it I remember when I was
off Candia once -

Ha interposed Jack that was the time you tumbled over the blessed
binnacle all in consequence of taking too much Madeira I remember it
too it's an out and out good story that ere You took a rope's end
you know and laid into the bowsprit and says you Get up you
lubber says you all the while a thinking I supposes as it was long
Jack Ingram the carpenter's mate laying asleep What a lark

This scoundrel will be the death of me said the admiral there isn't
one word of truth in what he says I never got drunk in all my life as
everybody knows Jack affairs are getting serious between you and I we
must part and for good It's a good many times that I've told you
you've forgot the difference between the quarter-deck and the caboose
Now I'm serious you're off the ship's books and there's an end of
you

Very good said Jack I'm willing I'll leave you Do you think I want
to keep you any longer Good bye old bloak I'll leave you to repent
and when old grim death comes yard-arm and yard-arm with you and you
can't shake off his boarding-tackle you'll say Where's Jack Pringle'
says you and then what's his mane oh ah echo you call it echo'll
say it's d  d if it knows

Jack turned upon his heel and before the admiral could make any reply
he left the place

What's the rascal up to now said the admiral I really didn't think
he'd have taken me at my word

Oh then after all you didn't mean it uncle said Charles

What's that to you you lubber whether I mean it or not you
shore-going squab Of course I expect everybody to desert an old hulk
rats and all and now Jack Pringle's gone the vagabond couldn't he
stay and get drunk as long as he liked Didn't he say what he pleased
and do what he pleased the mutinous thief Didn't he say I run away
from a Frenchman off Cape Ushant and didn't I put up with that

But my dear uncle you sent him away yourself

I didn't and you know I didn't but I see how it is you've disgusted
Jack among you A better seaman never trod the deck of a man-of-war

But his drunkenness uncle

It's a lie I don't believe he ever got drunk I believe you all
invented it and Jack's so good-natured he tumbled about just to keep
you in countenance

But his insolence uncle his gross insolence towards you his
inventions his exaggerations of the truth

Avast there avast there none of that Master Charlie Jack couldn't
do anything of the sort and I means to say this that if Jack was here
now I'd stick up for him and say he was a good seaman

Tip us your fin then said Jack darting into the room do you think
I'd leave you you d  d old fool What would become of you I wonder
if I wasn't to take you in to dry nurse Why you blessed old babby
what do you mean by it

Jack you villain

Ah go on and call me a villain as much as you like Don't you remember
when the bullets were scuttling our nobs

I do I do Jack tip us your fin old fellow You've saved my life
more than once

It's a lie

It ain't You did I say

You bed  d

And thus was the most serious misunderstanding that these two worthies
ever had together made up The real fact is that the admiral could as
little do without Jack as he could have done without food and as for
Pringle he no more thought of leaving the old commodore than of what
shall we say forswearing him Jack himself could not have taken a
stronger oath

But the old admiral had suffered so much from the idea that Jack had
actually left him that although he abused him as usual often enough he
never again talked of taking him off the ship's books and to the
credit of Jack be it spoken he took no advantage of the circumstance
and only got drunk just as usual and called his master an old fool
whenever it suited him




 LXXXV

THE HUNGARIAN NOBLEMAN GETS INTO DANGER HE IS FIRED AT AND SHOWS SOME
OF HIS QUALITY


Illustration

Considerably delighted was the Hungarian not only at the news he had
received from the boy but as well for the cheapness of it Probably he
did not conceive it possible that the secret of the retreat of such a
man as Varney could have been attained so easily

He waited with great impatience for the evening and stirred not from
the inn for several hours neither did he take any refreshment
notwithstanding he had made so liberal an arrangement with the landlord
to be supplied

All this was a matter of great excitement and speculation in the inn so
much so indeed that the landlord sent for some of the oldest customers
of his house regular topers who sat there every evening indulging in
strong drinks and pipes and tobacco to ask their serious advice as to
what he should do as if it were necessary he should do anything at all

But somehow or another these wiseacres who assembled at the landlord's
bidding and sat down with something strong before them in the bar
parlour never once seemed to think that a man might if he choosed
come to an inn and agree to pay four guineas a week for board and
lodging and yet take nothing at all

No they could not understand it and therefore they would not have it
It was quite monstrous that anybody should attempt to do anything so
completely out of the ordinary course of proceeding It was not to be
borne and as in this country it happens free and enlightened as we
are that no man can commit a greater social offence than doing
something that his neighbours never thought of doing themselves the
Hungarian nobleman was voted a most dangerous character and in fact
not to be put up with

I shouldn't have thought so much of it said the landlord but only
look at the aggravation of the thing After I have asked him four
guineas a week and expected to be beaten down to two to be then told
that he would not have cared if it had been eight It is enough to
aggravate a saint

Well I agree with you there said another that's just what it is
and I only wonder that a man of your sagacity has not quite understood
it before

Understood what

Why that he is a vampire He has heard of Sir Francis Varney that's
the fact and he's come to see him Birds of a feather you know flock
together and now we shall have two vampires in the town instead of

The party looked rather blank at this suggestion which indeed seemed
rather uncomfortable probably The landlord had just opened his mouth to
make some remark when he was stopped by the violent ringing of what he
now called the vampire's bell since it proceeded from the room where
the Hungarian nobleman was

Have you an almanack in the house was the question of the mysterious
guest

An almanack sir well I really don't know Let me see an almanack

But perhaps you can tell me I was to know the moon's age

The devil thought the landlord he's a vampire and no mistake Why
sir as to the moon's age it was a full moon last night very bright
and beautiful only you could not see it for the clouds

A full moon last night said the mysterious guest thoughtfully it
may shine then brightly to-night and if so all will be well I
thank you leave the room

Do you mean to say sir you don't want anything to eat now

What I want I'll order

But you have ordered nothing

Then presume that I want nothing

The discomfited landlord was obliged to leave the room for there was no
such a thing as making any answer to this and so still further
confirmed in his opinion that the stranger was a vampire that came to
see Sir Francis Varney from a sympathetic feeling towards him he again
reached the bar-parlour

You may depend he said as sure as eggs is eggs that he is a
vampire Hilloa he's going off after him after him he thinks we
suspect him There he goes down the High-street

The landlord ran out and so did those who were with him one of whom
carried his brandy and water in his hand which being too hot for him
to swallow all at once he still could not think of leaving behind

It was now gelling rapidly dark and the mysterious stranger was
actually proceeding towards the lane to keep his appointment with the
boy who had promised to conduct him to the hiding-place of Sir Francis
Varney

He had not proceeded far however before he began to suspect that he
was followed as it was evident on the instant that he altered his
course for instead of walking down the lane where the boy was waiting
for him he went right on and seemed desirous of making his way into
the open country between the town and Bannerworth Hall

His pursuers for they assumed that character when they saw this became
anxious to intercept him and thinking that the greater force they had
the better they called out aloud as they passed a smithy where a man
was shoeing a horse 

Jack Burdon here is another vampire

The deuce there is said the person who was addressed I'll soon
settle him Here's my wife gets no sleep of a night as it is all owing
to that Varney who has been plaguing us so long I won't put up with
another

So saying he snatched from a hook on which it hung an old
fowling-piece and joined the pursuit which now required to be
conducted with some celerity for the stranger had struck into the open
country and was getting on at good speed

The last remnants of the twilight were fading away and although the
moon had actually risen its rays were obscured by a number of light
fleecy clouds which although they did not promise to be of long
continuance as yet certainly impeded the light

Where is he going said the blacksmith He seems to be making his way
towards the mill-stream

No said another don't you see he is striking higher up towards the
old ford where the stepping-stones are

He is he is cried the blacksmith Run on run on don't you see he
is crossing it now Tell me all of you are you quite sure he is a
vampire and no mistake He ain't the exciseman landlord now is he

The exciseman the devil Do you think I want to shoot the exciseman

Very good then here goes exclaimed the Smith

He stooped and just as the brisk night air blew aside the clouds from
before the face of the moon and as the stranger was crossing the
slippery stones he fired at him

                                   

How silently and sweetly the moon's rays fall upon the water upon the
meadows and upon the woods The scenery appeared the work of
enchantment some fairy land waiting the appearance of its inhabitants
No sound met the ear the very wind was hushed nothing was there to
distract the sense of sight save the power of reflection

This indeed would aid the effect of such a scene A cloudless sky the
stars all radiant with beauty while the moon rising higher and higher
in the heavens increasing in the strength and refulgence of her light
and dimming the very stars which seemed to grow gradually invisible as
the majesty of the queen of night became more and more manifest

The dark woods and the open meadows contrasted more and more strongly
like light and shade the earth and sky were not more distinct and
apart and the ripling stream that rushed along with all the
impetuosity of uneven ground

The banks are clothed with verdure the tall sedges here and there
lined the sides beds of bulrushes raised their heads high above all
else and threw out their round clumps of blossoms like tufts and
looked strange in the light of the moon

Here and there too the willows bent gracefully over the stream and
their long leaves were wafted and borne up and down by the gentler force
of the stream

Below the stream widened and ran foaming over a hard stony bottom
and near the middle is a heap of stones of large stones that form the
bed of the river from which the water has washed away all earthy
particles and left them by themselves

These stones in winter could not be seen they were all under water and
the stream washed over in a turbulent and tumultuous manner But now
when the water was clear and low they are many of them positively out
of the water the stream running around and through their interstices
the water-weeds here and there lying at the top of the stream and
blossoming beautifully

The daisy-like blossoms danced and waved gently on the moving flood at
the same time they shone in the moonlight like fairy faces rising from
the depths of the river to receive the principle of life from the
moon's rays

'Tis sweet to wander in the moonlight at such an hour and it is sweet
to look upon such a scene with an unruffled mind and to give way to the
feelings that are engendered by a walk by the river side

See the moon is rising higher and higher the shadows grow shorter and
shorter the river which in places was altogether hidden by the tall
willow trees now gradually becomes less and less hidden and the water
becomes more and more lit up

The moonbeams play gracefully on the rippling surface here and there
appearing like liquid silver that each instant changed its position and
surface exposed to the light

Such a moment such a scene were by far too well calculated to cause
the most solemn and serious emotions of the mind and he must have been
but at best insensible who could wander over meadow and through grove
and yet remain untouched by the scene of poetry and romance in which he
breathed and moved

At such a time and in such a place the world is alive with all the
finer essences of mysterious life Tis at such an hour that the spirits
quit their secret abodes and visit the earth and whirl round the
enchanted trees

'Tis now the spirits of earth and air dance their giddy flight from
flower to flower Tis now they collect and exchange their greetings
the wood is filled with them the meadows teem with them the hedges at
the river side have them hidden among the deep green leaves and blades

But what is that yonder on the stones partially out of the water what
can it be The more it is looked at the more it resembles the human
form and yet it is still and motionless on the hard stones and yet it
is a human form The legs are lying in the water the arms appear to be
partially in and partially out they seem moved by the stream now and
then but very gently so slightly indeed that it might well be
questioned if it moved at all

The moon's rays had not yet reached it the bank on the opposite side of
the stream was high and some tall trees rose up and obscured the moon
But she was rising higher and higher each moment and finally when it
has reached the tops of those trees then the rays will reach the middle
of the river and then by degrees it will reach the stones in the
river and finally the body that lies there so still and so
mysteriously

How it came there it would be difficult to say It appeared as though
when the waters were high the body had floated down and at the
subsidence of the waters it had been left upon the stones and now it
was exposed to view

It was strange and mysterious and those who might look upon such a
sight would feel their blood chill and their body creep to contemplate
the remains of humanity in such a place and in such a condition as that
must be in

A human life had been taken How Who could tell Perhaps accident alone
was the cause of it perhaps some one had taken a life by violent means
and thrown the body in the waters to conceal the fact and the crime

The waters had brought it down and deposited it there in the middle of
the river without any human creature being acquainted with the fact

But the moon rises the beams come trembling through the tree tops and
straggling branches and fall upon the opposite bank and there lies the
body mid stream and in comparative darkness

By the time the river is lit up by the moon's rays then the object on
the stones will be visible then it can be ascertained what appears now
only probable namely is the dark object a human form or not

In the absence of light it appears to be so but when the flood of
silver light falls upon it it would be placed then beyond a doubt

The time is approaching the moon each moment approaches her meridian
and each moment do the rays increase in number and in strength while
the shadows shorten

The opposite bank each moment becomes more and more distinct and the
side of the stream the green rushes and sedges all by degrees come
full into view

Now and then a fish leaps out of the stream and just exhibits itself
as much as to say There are things living in the stream and I am one
of them

The moment is one of awe the presence of that mysterious and
dreadful-looking object even while its identity remains doubt chills
the heart it contracts the expanding thoughts to that one object all
interest in the scene lies centered in that one point

What could it be What else but a human body What else could assume
such a form But see nearly half the stream is lit by the moonbeams
struggling through the tree tops and now rising above them The light
increases and the shadows shorten

The edge of the bed of stones now becomes lit up by the moonlight the
rippling stream the bubbles and the tiny spray that was caused by the
rush of water against the stones seemed like sparkling flashes of
silver fire

Then came the moonbeams upon the body for it was raised above the level
of the water and shewed conspicuously for the moonbeams reached the
body before they fell on the surrounding water for that reason then it
was the body presented a strange and ghastly object against a deep dark
background by which it was surrounded

But this did not last long the water in another minute was lit up by
the moon's pale beams and then indeed could be plainly enough seen the
body of a man lying on the heap of stones motionless and ghastly

The colourless hue of the moonlight gave the object a most horrific and
terrible appearance The face of the dead man was turned towards the
moon's rays and the body seemed to receive all the light that could
fall upon it

It was a terrible object to look upon and one that added a new and
singular interest to the scene The world seemed then to be composed
almost exclusively of still life and the body was no impediment to the
stillness of the scene

It was all else considered a calm beautiful scene lovely the night
gorgeous the silvery rays that lit up the face of nature the hill and
dale meadow and wood and river all afforded contrasts strong
striking and strange

But strange and more strange than any contrast in nature was that
afforded to the calm beauty of the night and place by the deep stillness
and quietude imposed upon the mind by that motionless human body

The moon's rays now fell upon its full length the feet were lying in
the water the head lay back with its features turned towards the
quarter of the heavens where the moon shone from the hair floated on
the shallow water while the face and body were exposed to all
influences from its raised and prominent position

The moonbeams had scarcely settled upon it scarce a few minutes when
the body moved Was it the water that moved it it could not be surely
that the moonbeams had the power of recalling life into that inanimate
mass that lay there for some time still and motionless as the very
stones on which it lay

It was endued with life the dead man gradually rose up and leaned
himself upon his elbow he paused a moment like one newly recalled to
life he seemed to become assured he did live He passed one hand
through his hair which was wet and then rose higher into a sitting
posture and then he leaned on one hand inclining himself towards the
moon

His breast heaved with life and a kind of deep inspiration or groan
came from him as he first awoke to life and then he seemed to pause
for a few moments He turned gradually over till his head inclined down
the stream

Just below the water deepened and ran swiftly and silently on amid
meads and groves of trees The vampire was revived he awoke again to a
ghastly life he turned from the heap of stones he gradually allowed
himself to sink into deep water and then with a loud plunge he swam
to the centre of the river

Slowly and surely did he swim into the centre of the river and down the
stream he went He took long but easy strokes for he was going down
the stream and that aided him

For some distance might he be heard and seen through the openings in the
trees but he became gradually more and more indistinct till sound and
sight both ceased and the vampire had disappeared

During the continuance of this singular scene not one word had passed
between the landlord and his companions When the blacksmith fired the
fowling-piece and saw the stranger fall apparently lifeless upon the
stepping-stones that crossed the river he became terrified at what he
had done and gazed upon the seeming lifeless form with a face on which
the utmost horror was depicted

They all seemed transfixed to the spot and although each would have
given worlds to move away a kind of nightmare seemed to possess them
which stunned all their faculties and brought over them a torpidity
from which they found it impossible to arouse themselves

But when the apparently dead man moved again and when finally the
body which appeared so destitute of life rolled into the stream and
floated away with the tide their fright might be considered to have
reached its climax The absence of the body however had seemingly at
all events the effect of releasing them from the mental and physical
thraldom in which they were and they were enabled to move from the
spot which they did immediately making their way towards the town with
great speed

As they got near they held a sort of council of war as to what they
should do under the circumstances the result of which was that they
came to a conclusion to keep all that they had done and seen to
themselves for if they did not they might be called upon for some
very troublesome explanations concerning the fate of the supposed
Hungarian nobleman whom they had taken upon themselves to believe was a
vampire and to shoot accordingly without taking the trouble to inquire
into the legality of such an act

How such a secret was likely to be kept when it was shared amongst
seven people it is hard to say but if it were so kept it could only
be under the pressure of a strong feeling of self-preservation

They were forced individually of course to account for their absence
during the night at their respective homes and how they managed to do
that is best known to themselves

As to the landlord he felt compelled to state that having his
suspicions of his guest aroused he followed him on a walk that he
pretended to take and he had gone so far that at length he had given
up the chase and lost his own way in returning

Thus was it then that this affair still preserved all its mystery
with a large superadded amount of fear attendant upon it for if the
mysterious guest were really anything supernatural might he not come
again in a much more fearful shape and avenge the treatment he had
received

The only person who fell any disappointment in the affair or whose
expectations were not realised was the boy who had made the appointment
with the supposed vampire at the end of the lane and who was to have
received what he considered so large a reward for pointing out the
retreat of Sir Francis Varney

He waited in vain for the arrival of the Hungarian nobleman and at
last indignation got the better of him and he walked away Feeling
that he had been jilted he resolved to proceed to the public-house and
demand the half-crowns which had been so liberally promised him but
when he reached there he found that the party whom he sought was not
within nor the landlord either for that was the precise time when that
worthy individual was pursuing his guest over meadow and bill through
brake and through briar towards the stepping stones on the river

What the boy further did on the following day when he found that he was
to reap no more benefit for the adventure we shall soon perceive

As for the landlord he did endeavour to catch a few hours brief
repose but as he dreamed that the Hungarian nobleman came in the
likeness of a great toad and sat upon his chest feeling like the
weight of a mountain while he the landlord tried to scream and cry
for help but found that he could neither do one thing nor the other we
may guess that his repose did not at all invigorate him

As he himself expressed it he got up all of a shake with a strong
impression that he was a very ill-used individual indeed to have had
the nightmare in the day time

And now we will return to the cottage where the Bannerworth family were
at all events making themselves quite as happy as they did at their
ancient mansion in order to see what is there passing and how Dr
Chillingworth made an effort to get up some evidence of something that
the Bannerworth family knew nothing of therefore could not very well be
expected to render him much assistance That he did however make what
he considered an important discovery we shall perceive in the course of
the ensuing  in which it will be seen that the best hidden
things will by the merest accident sometimes come to light and that
too when least expected by any one at all connected with the result




 LXXXVI

THE DISCOVERY OF THE POCKET BOOK OF MARMADUKE BANNERWORTH ITS
MYSTERIOUS CONTENTS


Illustration

The little episode had just taken place which we have recorded between
the old admiral and Jack Pringle when Henry Bannerworth and Charles
Holland stepped aside to converse

Charles said Henry it has become absolutely necessary that I should
put an end to this state of dependence in which we all live upon your
uncle It is too bad to think that because through fighting the
battles of his country he has amassed some money we are to eat it up

My dear friend said Charles does it not strike you that it would
be a great deal worse than too bad if my uncle could not do what he
liked with his own

Yes but Charles that is not the question

I think it is though I know not what other question you can make of
it

We have all talked it over my mother my brother and Flora and my
brother and I have determined if this state of things should last much
longer to find out some means of honourable exertion by which we may
at all events maintain ourselves without being burdensome to any

Well well we will talk of that another time

Nay but hear me we were thinking that if we went into some branch of
the public service your uncle would have the pleasure such we are
quite sure it would be to him of assisting us greatly by his name and
influence

Well well Henry that's all very well but for a little time do not
throw up the old man and make him unhappy I believe I am his only
relative in the world and as he has often said he intended leaving me
heir to all he possesses you see there is no harm done by you receiving
a small portion of it beforehand

And said Henry by that line of argument we are to find an excuse
for robbing your uncle in the fact that we are robbing you likewise

No no indeed you do not view the matter rightly

Well all I can say is Charles that while I feel and while we all
feel the deepest debt of gratitude towards your uncle it is our duty
to do something In a box which we have brought with us from the Hall
and which has not been opened since our father's death I have stumbled
over some articles of ancient jewellery and plate which at all events
will produce something

But which you must not part with

Nay but Charles these are things I knew not we possessed and most
ill-suited do they happen to be to our fallen fortunes It is money we
want not the gewgaws of a former state to which we can have now no
sort of pretension

Nay I know you have all the argument but still is there something sad
and uncomfortable to one's feelings in parting with such things as those
which have been in families for many years

But we knew not that we had them remember that Charles Come and look
at them Those relics of a bygone age may amuse you and as regards
myself there are no circumstances whatever associated with them that
give them any extrinsic value so laugh at them or admire them as you
please I shall most likely be able to join with you in either feeling

Well be it so I will come and look at them but you must think better
of what you say concerning my uncle for I happen to know which you
ought likewise by this time how seriously the old man would feel any
rejection on your part of the good he fancies he is doing you I tell
you Henry it is completely his hobby and let him have earned his
money with ten times the danger he has he could not spend it with
anything like the satisfaction that he does unless he were allowed to
dispose of it in this way

Well well be it so for a time

The fact is his attachment to Flora is so great which is a most
fortunate circumstance for me that I should not be at all surprised
that she cuts me out of one half my estate when the old man dies But
come we will look at your ancient bijouterie

Henry led Charles into an apartment of the cottage where some of the few
things had been placed that were brought from Bannerworth Hall which
were not likely to be in constant and daily use

Among these things happened to be the box which Henry had mentioned and
from which he had taken a miscellaneous assortment of things of an
antique and singular character

There were old dresses of a season and of a taste long gone by ancient
articles of defence some curiously wrought daggers and a few
ornaments pretty but valueless along with others of more sterling
pretensions which Henry pointed out to Charles

I am almost inclined to think said the latter that some of these
things are really of considerable value but I do not I profess to be an
accurate judge and perhaps I am more taken with the beauty of an
article than the intrinsic worth What is that which you have just
taken from the box

It seems a half-mask said Henry made of silk and here are initial
letters within it M B

To what do they apply

Marmaduke Bannerworth my father

I regret I asked you

Nay Charles you need not Years have now elapsed since that misguided
man put a period to his own existence in the gardens of Bannerworth
Hall Of course the shock was a great one to us all although I must
confess that we none of us knew much of a father's affections But time
reconciles one to these dispensations and to a friend like yourself I
can talk upon these subjects without a pang

He laid down the mask and proceeded further in his search in the old
box

Towards the bottom of it there were some books and crushed in by the
side of them there was an ancient-looking pocket-book which Charles
pointed out saying 

There Henry who knows but you may find a fortune when you least
expect it

Those who expect nothing said Henry will not be disappointed At
all events as regards this pocket-book you see it is empty

Not quite A card has fallen from it

Charles took up the card and read upon it the name of Count Barrare

That name he said seems familiar to me Ah now I recollect I have
read of such a man He flourished some twenty or five-and-twenty years
ago and was considered a roue of the first water a finished
gamester and in a sort of brief memoir I read once of him it said
that he disappeared suddenly one day and was never again heard of

Indeed I'm not puzzled to think how his card came into my father's
pocket-book They met at some gaming-house and if some old pocket-book
of the Count Barrare's were shaken there might fall from it a card
with the name of Mr Marmaduke Bannerworth upon it

Is there nothing further in the pocket-book no memoranda

I will look Stay here is something upon one of the leaves let me
see Mem twenty-five thousand pounds He who robs the robber steals
little it was not meant to kill him but it will be unsafe to use the
money for a time my brain seems on fire the remotest hiding-place in
the house is behind the picture

What do you think of that said Charles

I know not what to think There is one thing though that I do know

And what is that

It is my father's handwriting I have many scraps of his and his
peculiar hand is familiar to me

It's very strange then what it can refer to

Charles Charles there is a mystery connected with our fortunes that
I never could unravel and once or twice it seemed as if we were upon
the point of discovering all but something has ever interfered to
prevent us and we have been thrown back into the realms of conjecture
My father's last words were The money is hidden and then he tried to
add something but death stopped his utterance Now does it not almost
seem that this memorandum alluded to the circumstance

It does indeed

And then scarcely had my father breathed his last when a man comes
and asks for him at the garden-gate and upon hearing that he is dead
utters some imprecations and walks away

Well Henry you must trust to time and circumstances to unravel these
mysteries For myself I own that I cannot do so I see no earthly way
out of the difficulty whatever But still it does appear to me as if Dr
Chillingworth knew something or had heard something with which he
really ought to make you acquainted

Do not blame the worthy doctor he may have made an error of judgment
but never one of feeling and you may depend if he is keeping anything
from me that he is doing so from some excellent motive most probably
because he thinks it will give me pain and so will not let me endure
any unhappiness from it unless he is quite certain as regards the
facts When he is so you may depend he will be communicative and I
shall know all that he has to relate But Charles it is evident to me
that you too are keeping something

I

Yes you acknowledge to having had an interview and a friendly one
with Varney and you likewise acknowledge that he had told you things
which he has compelled you to keep secret

I have promised to keep them secret and I deeply regret the promise
that I have made There cannot be anything to my mind more essentially
disagreeable than to have one's tongue tied in one's interview with
friends I hate to hear anything that I may not repeat to those whom I
take into my own confidence

I can understand the feeling but here comes the worthy doctor

Show him the memorandum

I will

As Dr Chillingworth entered the apartments Henry handed him the
memorandum that had been found in the old pocket-book saying as he did
so 

Look at that doctor and give us your candid opinion upon it

Dr Chillingworth fitted on his spectacles and read the paper
carefully At its conclusion he screwed up his mouth into an extremely
small compass and doubling up the paper he put it into his capacious
waistcoat pocket saying as he did so 

Oh oh oh oh hum

Well doctor said Henry we are waiting for your opinion

My opinion Well then my dear boy I must say my opinion to the
best of my belief is that I really don't know anything about it

Then perhaps you'll surrender us the memorandum said Charles
because if you don't know anything we may as well make a little
inquiry

Ha said the worthy doctor we can't put old heads upon young
shoulders that's quite clear Now my good young men be patient and
quiet recollect that what you know you're acquainted with and that
that which is hidden from you you cannot very well come to any very
correct conclusion upon There's a right side and a wrong one you may
depend to every question and he who walks heedlessly in the dark is
very apt to run his head against a post Good evening my boys good
evening

Away bustled the doctor

Well said Charles what do you think of that Mr Henry

I think he knows what he's about

That may be but I'll be hanged if anybody else does The doctor is by
no means favourable to the march of popular information and I really
think he might have given us some food for reflection instead of
leaving us so utterly and entirely at fault as he has and you know he's
taken away your memorandum even

Let him have it Charles let him have it it is safe with him The old
man may be and I believe is a little whimsical and crotchety but he
means abundantly well and he's just one of those sort of persons and
always was who will do good his own way or not at all so we must take
the good with the bad in those cases and let Dr Chillingworth do as he
pleases

I cannot say it is nothing to me although those words were rising to
my lips because you know Henry that everything which concerns you or
yours is something to me and therefore it is that I feel extremely
anxious for the solution of all this mystery Before I hear the sequel
of that which Varney the vampire has so strongly made me a confidant
of I will at all events make an effort to procure his permission to
communicate it to all those who are in any way beneficially interested
in the circumstances Should he refuse me that permission I am almost
inclined myself to beg him to withhold his confidence

Nay do not do so Charles do not do that I implore you Recollect
although you cannot make us joint recipients with you in your knowledge
you can make use of it probably to our advantage in saving us
perchance from the different consequences so that you can make what
you know in some way beneficial to us although not in every way

There is reason in that and I give in at once Be it so Henry I will
wait on him and if I cannot induce him to change his determination and
allow me to tell some other as well as Flora I must give in and take
the thing as a secret although I shall not abandon a hope even after
he has told me all he has to tell that I may induce him to permit me to
make a general confidence instead of the partial one he has empowered
me to do

It may be so and at all events we must not reject a proffered good
because it is not quite so complete as it might be

You are right I will keep my appointment with him entertaining the
most sanguine hope that our troubles and disasters I say our because I
consider myself quite associated in thought interest and feelings with
your family may soon be over

Heaven grant it may be so for your's and Flora's sake but I feel that
Bannerworth Hall will never again be the place it was to us I should
prefer that we sought for new associations which I have no doubt we may
find and that among us we get up some other home that would be happier
because not associated with so many sad scenes in our history

Be it so and I am sure that the admiral would gladly give way to such
an arrangement He has often intimated that he thought Bannerworth Hall
a dull place consequently although he pretends to have purchased it of
you I think he will be very glad to leave it

Illustration

Be it so then If it should really happen that we are upon the eve of
any circumstances that will really tend to relieve us from our misery
and embarrassments we will seek for some pleasanter abode than the
Hall which you may well imagine since it became the scene of that
dreadful tragedy that left us fatherless has borne but a distasteful
appearance to all our eyes

I don't wonder at that and am only surprised that after such a thing
had happened any of you liked to inhabit the place

We did not like but our poverty forced us You have no notion of the
difficulties through which we have struggled and the fact that we had a
home rent free was one of so much importance to us that had it been
surrounded by a thousand more disagreeables than it was we must have
put up with it but now that we owe so much to the generosity of your
uncle I suppose we can afford to talk of what we like and of what we
don't like

You can Henry and it shall not be my fault if you do not always
afford to do so and now as the time is drawing on I think I will
proceed at once to Varney for it is better to be soon than late and
get from him the remainder of his story

                                   

There were active influences at work to prevent Sir Francis Varney from
so quickly as he had arranged to do carrying out his intention of
making Charles Holland acquainted with the history of the eventful
period of his life which had been associated with Marmaduke
Bannerworth

One would have scarcely thought it possible that anything now would have
prevented Varney from concluding his strange narrative but that he was
prevented will appear

The boy who had been promised such liberal payment by the Hungarian
nobleman for betraying the place of Varney's concealment we have
already stated felt bitterly the disappointment of not being met
according to promise at the corner of the lane by that individual

It not only deprived him of the half-crowns which already in
imagination he had laid out but it was a great blow to his own
importance for after his discovery of the residence of the vampire he
looked upon himself as quite a public character and expected great
applause for his cleverness

But when the Hungarian nobleman came not all these dreams began to
vanish into thin air and like the unsubstantial fabric of a vision to
leave no trace behind them

He got dreadfully aggravated and his first thought was to go to Varney
and see what he could get from him by betraying the fact that some one
was actively in search of him

That seemed however a doubtful good and perhaps there was some
personal dread of the vampire mixed up with the rejection of this
proposition But reject it he did and then he walked moodily into the
town without any fixed resolution of what he should do

All that he thought of was a general idea that he should like to create
some mischief if possible what it was he cared not so long as it made
a disturbance

Now he knew well that the most troublesome and fidgetty man in the town
was Tobias Philpots a saddler who was always full of everybody's
business but his own and ever ready to hear any scandal of his
neighbours

I have a good mind said the boy to go to old Philpots and tell him
all about it that I have

The good mind soon strengthened itself into a fixed resolution and full
of disdain and indignation at the supposed want of faith of the
Hungarian nobleman he paused opposite the saddler's door

Could he but for a moment have suspected the real reason why the
appointment had not been kept with him all his curiosity would have
been doubly aroused and he would have followed the landlord of the inn
and his associate upon the track of the second vampire that had visited
the town

But of this he knew nothing for that proceeding had been conducted with
amazing quietness and the fact of the Hungarian nobleman when he found
that he was followed taking a contrary course to that in which Varney
was concealed prevented the boy from knowing anything of his movements

Hence the thing looked to him like a piece of sheer neglect and
contemptuous indifference which he felt bound to resent

He did not pause long at the door of the saddler's but after a few
moments he walked boldly in and said 

Master Philpots I have got something extraordinary to tell you and
you may give me what you like for telling you

Go on then said the saddler that's just the price I always likes
to pay for everything

Will you keep it secret said the boy

Of course I will When did you ever hear of me telling anything to a
single individual

Never to a single individual but I have heard you tell things to the
whole town

Confound your impudence Get out of my shop directly

Oh very good I can go and tell old Mitchell the pork-butcher

No I say stop don't tell him If anybody is to know let it be me
and I'll promise you I'll keep it secret

Very good said the boy returning you shall know it and mind you
have promised me to keep it secret so that if it gets known you know
it cannot be any fault of mine

The fact was the boy was anxious it should be known only that in case
some consequences might arise he thought he would quiet his own
conscience by getting a promise of secrecy from Tobias Philpots which
he well knew that individual would not think of keeping

He then related to him the interview he had had with the Hungarian
nobleman at the inn how he had promised a number of half-crowns but a
very small instalment of which he had received

All this Master Philpots cared very little for but the information that
the dreaded Varney the vampire was concealed so close to the town was
a matter of great and abounding interest and at that part of the story
he suddenly pricked up his ears amazingly

Why you don't mean to say that he exclaimed Are you sure it was
he

Yes I am quite certain I have seen I him more than once It was Sir
Francis Varney without any mistake

Why then you may depend he's only waiting until it's very dark and
then he will walk into somebody and suck his blood Here's a horrid
discovery I thought we had had enough of Master Varney and that he
would hardly show himself here again and now you tell me he is not ten
minutes walk off

It's a fact said the boy I saw him go in and he looks thinner and
more horrid than ever I am sure he wants a dollop of blood from
somebody

I shouldn't wonder

Now there is Mrs Philpots you know sir she's rather big and seems
most ready to burst always I shouldn't wonder if the vampire came to
her to-night

Wouldn't you said Mrs Philpots who had walked into the shop and
overheard the whole conversation wouldn't you really I'll vampire
you and teach you to make these remarks about respectable married
women You young wretch take that will you

She gave the boy such a box on the ears that the place seemed to spin
round with him As soon as he recovered sufficiently to be enabled to
walk he made his way from the shop with abundance of precipitation
much regretting that he had troubled himself to make a confidant of
Master Philpots

But however he could not but tell himself that if his object was to
make a general disturbance through the whole place he had certainly
succeeded in doing so

He slunk home perhaps with a feeling that he might be called upon to
take part in something that might ensue and at all events be compelled
to become a guide to the place of Sir Francis Varney's retreat in which
case for all he knew the vampire might by some more than mortal
means discover what a hand he had had in the matter and punish him
accordingly

The moment he hid left the saddler's Mrs Philpots after using some
bitter reproaches to her husband for not at once sacrificing the boy
upon the spot for the disrespectful manner in which he had spoken of
her hastily put on her bonnet and shawl and the saddler although it
was a full hour before the usual time began putting up the shutters of
his shop

Why my dear he said to Mrs Philpots when she came down stairs
equipped for the streets why my dear where are you going

And pray sir what are you shutting up the shop for at this time of
the evening

Oh why the fact is I thought I'd just go to the Rose and Crown and
mention that the vampire was so near at hand

Well Mr Philpots and in that case there can be no harm in my calling
upon some of my acquaintance and mentioning it likewise

Why I don't suppose there would be much harm only remember Mrs
Philpots remember if you please -

Remember what

To tell everybody to keep it secret

Oh of course I will and mind you do it likewise

Most decidedly

The shop was closed Mr Philpots ran off to the Rose and Crown and
Mrs Philpots with as much expedition as she could purposed making the
grand tour of all her female acquaintance in the town just to tell
them as a great secret that the vampire Sir Francis Varney as he
called himself had taken refuge at the house that was to let down the
lane leading to Higgs's farm

But by no means she said let it go no further because it is a very
wrong thing to make any disturbance and you will understand that it's
quite a secret

She was listened to with breathless attention as may well be supposed
and it was a singular circumstance that at every house she left some
other lady put on her bonnet and shawl and ran out to make the circle
of her acquaintance with precisely the same story and precisely the
same injunctions to secrecy

And as Mr Philpots pursued an extremely similar course we are not
surprised that in the short space of one hour the news should have
spread through all the town and that there was scarcely a child old
enough to understand what was being talked about who was ignorant of
the fact that Sir Francis Varney was to be found at the empty house
down the lane

It was an unlucky time too for the night was creeping on a period at
which people's apprehension of the supernatural becomes each moment
stronger and more vivid a period at which a number of idlers are let
loose for different employments and when anything in the shape of a row
or a riot presents itself in pleasant colours to those who have nothing
to lose and who expect under the cover of darkness to be able to
commit outrages they would be afraid to think of in the daytime when
recognition would be more easy

Thus was it that Sir Francis Varney's position although he knew it not
became momentarily one of extreme peril and the danger he was about to
run was certainly greater than any he had as yet experienced Had
Charles Holland but known what was going on he would undoubtedly have
done something to preserve the supposed vampire from the mischief that
threatened him but the time had not arrived when he had promised to pay
him a second visit so he had no idea of anything serious having
occurred

Perhaps too Mr and Mrs Philpots scarcely anticipated creating so
much confusion but when they found that the whole place was in an
uproar and that a tumultuous assemblage of persons called aloud for
vengeance upon Varney the vampire they made their way home again in no
small fright

And now what was the result of all these proceedings will be best
known by our introducing the reader to the interior of the house in
which Varney had found a temporary refuge and following in detail his
proceedings as he waited for the arrival of Charles Holland




 LXXXVII

THE HUNT FOR VARNEY THE HOUSE-TOPS THE MIRACULOUS ESCAPE THE LAST
PLACE OF REFUGE THE COTTAGE


Illustration

On the tree tops the moon shines brightly and the long shadows are
shooting its rays down upon the waters and the green fields appear
clothed in a flood of silver light the little town was quiet and
tranquil nature seemed at rest

The old mansion in which Sir Francis Varney had taken refuge stood
empty and solitary it seemed as though it were not associated with the
others by which it was surrounded It was gloomy and in the moonlight
it reminded one of things long gone by existences that had once been
but now no longer of this present time a mere memento of the past

Sir Francis Varney reclined upon the house-top he gazed upon the sky
and upon the earth he saw the calm tranquillity that reigned around
and could not but admire what he saw he sighed he seemed to sigh from
a pleasure he felt in the fact of his security he could repose there
without fear and breathe the balmy air that fanned his cheek

Certainly he muttered things might have been worse but not much
worse however they might have been much better the ignorant are
away the most to be feared because they have no guide and no control
save what can be exerted over them by their fears and their passions

He paused to look again over the scene and as far as the eye could
reach and that moonlight as it was was many miles the country was
diversified with hill and dale meadow and ploughed land the open
fields and the darker woods and the silvery stream that ran at no
great distance all presented a scene that was well calculated to warm
the imagination and to give the mind that charm which a cultivated
understanding is capable of receiving

There was but one thing wanted to make such a scene one of pure
happiness and that was all absence of care of fears for the future and
the wants of life

Suddenly there was a slight sound that came from the town It was very
slight but the ears of Sir Francis Varney were painfully acute of late
the least sound that came across him was heard in a moment and his
whole visage was changed to one of listening interest

The sound was hushed but his attention was not lulled for he had been
placed in circumstances that made all his vigilance necessary for his
own preservation Hence it was what another would have passed over or
not heard at all he both heard and noticed He was not sure of the
nature of the sound it was so slight and so indistinct

There it was again Some persons were moving about in the town The
sounds that came upon the night air seemed to say that there was an
unusual bustle in the town which was to Sir Francis Varney ominous in
the extreme

What could people in such a quiet retired place require out at such an
hour at night It must be something very unusual something that must
excite them to a great degree and Sir Francis began to feel very
uneasy

They surely he muttered to himself they surely cannot have found
out my hiding place and intend to hunt me from it the blood-thirsty
hounds they are never satisfied The mischief they are permitted to do
on one occasion is but the precursor to another The taste has caused
the appetite for more and nothing short of his blood can satisfy it

The sounds increased and the noise came nearer and nearer and it
appeared as though a number of men had collected together and were
coming towards him Yes they were coming down the lane towards the
deserted mansion where he was

For once in his life Sir Francis Varney trembled he felt sick at
heart though no man was less likely to give up hope and to despair than
he yet this sign of unrelenting hatred and persecution was too
unequivocal and too stern not to produce its effect upon even his mind
for he had no doubt but that they were coming with the express purpose
of seeking him

How they could have found him out was a matter he could not imagine The
Bannerworths could not have betrayed him he was sure of that and yet
who could have seen him so cautious and so careful as he had been and
so very sparing had he lived because he would not give the slightest
cause for all that was about to follow He hoped to have hidden himself
but now he could hear the tramp of men distinctly and their voices came
now on the night air though it was in a subdued tone as if they were
desirous of approaching unheard and unseen by their victim

Sir Francis Varney stirred not from his position He remained silent and
motionless He appeared not to heed what was going on perhaps he hoped
to see them go by to be upon some false scent or if they saw no signs
of life they might leave the place and go elsewhere

Hark they stop at the house they go not by they seem to pause and
then a thundering knock came at the door which echoed and re-echoed
through the empty and deserted house on the top of which sat in silent
expectation the almost motionless Sir Francis Varney the redoubted
vampire

The knock which came so loud and so hard upon the door caused Sir

Francis to start visibly for it seemed his own knell Then as if the
mob were satisfied with their knowledge of his presence and of their
victory and of his inability to escape them they sent up a loud shout
that filled the whole neighbourhood with its sound

It seemed to come from below and around the house it rose from all
sides and that told Sir Francis Varney that the house was surrounded
and all escape was cut off there was no chance of his being able to
rush through such a multitude of men as that which now encircled him

With the calmest despair Sir Francis Varney lay still and motionless on
the house-top and listened to the sounds that proceeded from below
Shout after shout arose on the still calm air of the night knock after
knock came upon the stout old door which awakened responsive echoes
throughout the house that had for many years lain dormant and which now
seemed disturbed and resounded in hollow murmurs to the voices from
without

Then a loud voice shouted from below as if to be heard by any one who
might be within 

Sir Francis Varney the vampire come out and give yourself up at
discretion If we have to search for you you may depend it will be to
punish you you will suffer by burning Come out and give yourself up

There was a pause and then a loud shout

Sir Francis Varney paid no attention to this summons but sat
motionless on the house-top where he could hear all that passed below
in the crowd

He will not come out said one

Ah he's much too cunning to be caught in such a trap Why he knows
what you would do with him he knows you would stake him and make a
bonfire about him

So he has no taste for roasting remarked another but still it's no
use hiding we have too many hands and know the house too well to be
easily baffled

That may be and although he don't like burning yet we will unearth
the old fox somehow or other we have discovered his haunt at last and
certainly we'll have him out

How shall we get in

Knock in the door break open the door the front door that is the
best because it leads to all parts of the house and we can secure any
one who attempts to move from one to the other as they come down

Hurrah shouted several men in the crowd

Hurrah echoed the mob with one accord and the shout rent the air
and disturbed the quietude and serenity that scarce five minutes before
reigned through the place

Then as if actuated by one spirit they all set to work to force the
door in It was strong and capable of great defence and employed them
with some labour for fifteen or twenty minutes and then with a loud
crash the door fell in

Hurrah again shouted the crowd

These shouts announced the fall of the door and then and not until
then did Sir Francis Varney stir

They have broken in the door he muttered well if die I must I
will sell my life dearly However all is not yet lost and in the
struggle for life the loss is not so much felt

He got up and crept towards the trap that led into the house or out of
it as the occasion might require

The vampire the vampire shouted a man who stood on a garden wall
holding on by the arm of an apple-tree

Varney the vampire shouted a second

Hurrah boys we are on the right scent now for a hunt hurrah we
shall have him now

They rushed in a tumultuous riot up the stone steps and into the hall
It was a large spacious place with a grand staircase that led up to
the upper floor but it had two ends and then terminated in a gallery

It could not be defended by one man save at the top where it could not
long be held because the assailants could unite and throw their whole
weight against the entrance and thus storm it This actually happened

They looked up and seeing nobody they rushed up some by one stair
and some by the other but it was dark there were but few of the moon's
rays that pierced the gloom of that place and those who first reached
the place which we have named were seized with astonishment staggered
and fell

Sir Francis Varney had met them he stood there with a staff something
he had found about the house not quite so long as a broom-handle but
somewhat thicker and heavier being made of stout ash

This formidable weapon Sir Francis Varney wielded with strength and
resolution he was a tall man and one of no mean activity and personal
strength and such a weapon in his hands was one of a most fearful
character and for the occasion much better than his sword

Man after man fell beneath the fearful brace of these blows for though
they could not see Sir Francis yet he could see them or the
hall-lights were behind them at the time while he stood in the dark
and took advantage of this to deal murderous blows upon his assailants

This continued for some minutes till they gave way before such a
vigorous defence and paused

On neighbours on cried one will you be beaten off by one man
Rush in at once and you must force him from his position push him hard
and he must give way

Ay said one fellow who sat upon the ground rubbing his head it's
all very well to say push him hard but if you felt the weight of that
d  d pole on your head you wouldn't be in such a blessed hurry

However true that might be there was but little attention paid to it
and a determined rush was made at the entrance to the gallery and they
found that it was unoccupied and that was explained by the slamming of
a door and its being immediately locked upon them and when the mob
came to the door they found they had to break their way through another
door

This did not take long in effecting and in less than five minutes they
had broken through that door which led into another room but the first
man who entered it fell from a crashing blow on the head from the ashen
staff of Sir Francis Varney who hurried and fled closely pursued
until he came to another door through which he dashed

Here he endeavoured to make a stand and close it but was immediately
struck and grappled with but he threw his assailant and turned and
fled again

His object had been to defend each inch of the ground as long as he was
able but he found they came too close upon his steps and prevented his
turning in time to try the strength of his staff upon the foremost

He dashed up the first staircase with surprising rapidity leaving his
pursuers behind and when he had gained the first landing he turned
upon those who pursued him who could hardly follow him two abreast

Down with the vampire shouted the first who rushed up heedless of
the staff

Down with a fool thundered Varney as he struck the fellow a terrific
blow which covered his face with blood and he fell back into the arms
of his companions

A bitter groan and execration arose from them below and again they
shouted and rushed up headlong

Down with the vampire was again shouted and met by a corresponding
but deep guttural sound of 

Down with a fool

And sure enough the first again came to the earth without any
preparation save the application of an ashen stick to his skull which
by-the-bye no means aided the operation of thinking

Several more shared a similar fate but they pressed hard and Sir
Francis was compelled to give ground to keep them at the necessary
length from him as they rushed on regardless of his blows and if he
had not he would soon have been engaged in a personal struggle for they
were getting too close for him to use the staff

Down with the vampire was the renewed cry as they drove him from
spot to spot until he reached the roof of the house and then he ran up
the steps to the loft which he had just reached when they came up to
the bottom

Varney attempted to draw the ladder up but four or five stout men held
that down then by a sudden turn as they were getting up he turned it
over threw those on it down and the ladder too upon the heads of
those who were below

Down with the vampire shouted the mob as they with the most
untiring energy set the ladder or steps against the loft and as many
as could held it while others rushed up to attack Varney with all the
ferocity and courage of so many bull dogs

It was strange but the more they were baffled the more enraged and
determined they rushed on to a new attack with greater resolution than
ever

On this occasion however they were met with a new kind of missile for
Sir Francis had either collected and placed there for the occasion or
they had been left there for years a number of old bricks which lay
close at hand These he took one by one and deliberately took aim at
them and flung them with great force striking down every one they hit

This caused them to recoil the bricks caused fearful gashes in their
heads and the wounds were serious the flesh being in many places
torn completely off They however only paused for one man said 

Be of good heart comrades we can do as he does he has furnished us
with weapons and we can thus attack him in two ways and he must give
way in the end

Hurrah down with the vampire sounded from all sides and the shout
was answered by a corresponding rush

It was true Sir Francis had furnished them with weapons to attack
himself for they could throw them back at him which they did and
struck him a severe blow on the head and it covered his face with blood
in a moment

Hurrah shouted the assailants another such a blow and all will be
over with the vampire

He's got 

Press him sharp now cried another man as he aimed another blow with
a brick which struck Varney on the arm causing him to drop the brick
he held in his hand He staggered back apparently in great pain

Up up we have him now he cannot get away he's hurt we have him we
have him

And up they went with all the rapidity they could scramble up the steps
but this had given Varney time to recover himself and though his right
arm was almost useless yet he contrived with his left to pitch the
bricks so as to knock over the first three or four when seeing that he
could not maintain his position to advantage he rushed to the outside
of the house the last place he had capable of defence

There was a great shout by those outside when they saw him come out and
stand with his staff and those who came first got first served for the
blows resounded while he struck them and sent them over below

Then came a great shout from within and without and then a desperate
rush was made at the door and in the next instant Varney was seen
flying followed by his pursuers one after the other some tumbling
over the tiles to the imminent hazard of their necks

Sir Francis Varney rushed along with a speed that appeared by far too
great to admit of being safely followed and yet those who followed
appeared infected by his example and appeared heedless of all
consequences by which their pursuit might be attended to themselves

Hurrah shouted the mob below

Hurrah answered the mob on the tiles

Then over several housetops might be seen the flying figure of Sir
Francis Varney pursued by different men at a pace almost equal to his
own

They however could keep up the same speed and not improve upon it
while he kept the advantage he first obtained in the start

Then suddenly he disappeared

It seemed to the spectators below that he had dropped through a house
and they immediately surrounded the house as well as they could and
then set up another shout

This took place several times and as often was the miserable man hunted
from his place of refuge only to seek another from which he was in like
manner hunted by those who thirsted for his blood

On one occasion they drove him into a house which was surrounded save
at one point which had a long room or building in it that ran some
distance out and about twenty feet high

At the entrance to the roof of this place or leads he stood and
defended himself for some moments with success but having received a
blow himself he was compelled to retire while the mob behind forced
those in front forward faster than he could by any exertion wield the
staff that had so much befriended him on this occasion

He was therefore on the point of being overwhelmed by numbers when he
fled but alas there was no escape a bare coping stone and rails ran
round the top of that

There was not much time for hesitation but he jumped over the rails and
looked below It was a great height but if he fell and hurt himself he
knew he was at the mercy of the bloodhounds behind him who would do
anything but show him any mercy or spare him a single pang

He looked round and beheld his pursuers close upon him and one was so
close to him that he seized upon his arm saying as he shouted to his
companions 

Hurrah boys I have him

With an execration Sir Francis wielded his staff with such force that
he struck the fellow on the head crushing in his hat as if it had been
only so much paper The man fell but a blow followed from some one else
which caused Varney to relax his hold and finding himself falling he
to save himself sprang away

The rails at that moment were crowded with men who leaned over to
ascertain the effect of the leap

He'll be killed said one

He's sure to be smashed said another

I'll lay any wager he'll break a limb said a third

Varney came to the earth for a moment he lay stunned and not able to
move hand or foot

Hurrah shouted the mob

Their triumph was short for just as they shouted Varney arose and
after a moment or two's stagger he set off at full speed which produced
another shout from the mob and just at that moment a body of his
pursuers were seen scaling the walls after him

There was now a hunt through all the adjoining fields from cover after
cover they pursued him until he found no rest from the hungry wolves
that beset him with cries resembling beasts of prey rather than any
human multitude

Sir Francis heard them at the same time with the despair of a man who
is struggling for life and yet knows he is struggling in vain he knew
his strength was decaying his immense exertions and the blows he had
received all weakened him while the number and strength of his foes
seemed rather to increase than to diminish

Once more he sought the houses and for a moment he believed himself
safe but that was only a momentary deception for they had traced him

He arrived at a garden wall over which he bounded and then he rushed
into the house the door of which stood open for the noise and
disturbance had awakened most of the inhabitants who were out in all
directions

He took refuge in a small closet on the stairs but was seen to do so by
a girl who screamed out with fear and fright

Murder murder the wampyre the wampyre with all her strength and
in the way of screaming that was no little and then she went off into a
fit

This was signal enough and the house was at once entered and beset on
all sides by the mob who came impatient of obtaining their victim who
had so often baffled them

There he is there he is said the girl who came to as soon as other
people came up

Where where

In that closet she said pointing to it with her finger I see'd him
go in the way above

Sir Francis finding himself betrayed immediately came out of the
closet just as two or three were advancing to open it and dealt so
hard a blow on the head of the first that came near him that he fell
without a groan and a second shared the same fate and then Sir Francis
found himself grappled with but with a violent effort he relieved
himself and rushed up stairs

Oh murder the wampyre what shall I do fire fire

These exclamations were uttered in consequence of Varney in his haste to
get up stairs having inadvertently stepped into the girl's lap with one
foot while he kicked her in the chin with the other besides scratching
her nose till it bled

After him stick to him shouted the mob but the girl kicked and
sprawled so much they were impeded till regardless of her cries they
ran over her and pursued Varney who was much distressed with the
exertions he had made

After about a minute's race he turned upon the head of the stair not so
much with the hope of defending it as of taking some breathing time but
seeing his enemies so close he drew his sword and stood panting but
prepared

Never mind his toasting-fork said one bulky fellow and as he spoke
he rushed on but the point of the weapon entered his heart and he fell
dead

There was a dreadful execration uttered by those who came up after him
and there was a momentary pause for none liked to rush on to the bloody
sword of Sir Francis Varney who stood so willing and so capable of
using it with the most deadly effect They paused as well they might
and this pause was the most welcome thing next to life to the
unfortunate fugitive for he was dreadfully distressed and bleeding

On to him boys He can hardly stand See how he pants On to him I
say push him hard

He pushes hard I tell you said another I felt the point of his
sword as it came through Giles's back

I'll try my luck then said another and he rushed up but he was met
by the sword of Sir Francis who pierced it through his side and he
fell back with a groan

Sir Francis fearful of stopping any longer to defend that point
appeared desirous of making good his retreat with some little advantage
and he rushed up stairs before they had recovered from the momentary
consternation into which they had been thrown by the sudden disaster
they had received

Illustration

But they were quickly after him and before he wearied as he was could
gain the roof they were up the ladder after him

The first man who came through the trap was again set upon by Varney
who made a desperate thrust at him and it took effect but the sword
snapped by the handle

With an execration Sir Francis threw the hilt at the head of the next
man he saw then rushing with headlong speed he distanced his pursuers
for some house tops

But the row of houses ended at the one he was then at and he could go
no further What was to be done The height was by far too great to be
jumped death was certain A hideous heap of crushed and mangled bones
would be the extent of what would remain of him and then perhaps life
not extinct for some hours afterwards

He turned round he saw them coming hallooing over the house tops like
a pack of hounds Sir Francis struck his hands together and groaned He
looked round and perceived some ivy peeping over the coping-stone A
thought struck him and he instantly ran to the spot and leaned over

Saved saved he exclaimed

Then placing his hand over he felt for the ivy then he got over and
hung by the coping-stone in a perilous position till he found a spot
on which he could rest his foot and then he grasped the ivy as low down
as he could and thus he lowered himself a short way till he came to
where the ivy was stronger and more secure to the wall as the upper
part was very dangerous with his weight attached to it

The mob came on very sure of having Sir Francis Varney in their power
and they did not hurry on so violently as their position was dangerous
at that hour of the night

Easy boys easy was the cry The bird is our own he can't get
away that's very certain

They however came on and took no time about it hardly but what was
their amazement and rage at finding he had disappeared

Where is he was the universal inquiry and I don't know an almost
universal answer

There was a long pause while they searched around but they saw no
vestige of the object of their search

There's no trap door open remarked one and I don't think he could
have got in at any one

Perhaps finding he could not get away he has taken the desperate
expedient of jumping over and committing suicide and so escape the
doom he ought to be subjected to

Probably he has but then we can run a stake through him and burn him
all the same

They now approached the extreme verge of the houses and looked over the
sides but they could see nothing The moon was up and there was light
enough to have seen him if he had fallen to the earth and they were
quite sure that he could not have got up after such a fall as he must
have received

We are beaten after all neighbours

I am not so sure of that was the reply He may now be hidden about
for he was too far spent to be able to go far he could not do that I
am sure

I think not either

Might he not have escaped by means of that ivy yonder said one of
the men pointing to the plant as it climbed over the coping-stones of
the wall

Yes it may be possible said one and yet it is very dangerous if
not certain destruction to get over

Oh yes there is no possibility of escape that way Why it wouldn't
bear a cat for there are no nails driven into the wall at this height

Never mind said another we may as well leave no stone unturned as
the saying is but at once set about looking out for him

The individual who spoke now leant over the coping stone for some
moments in silence He could see nothing but yet he continued to gaze
for some moments

Do you see him inquired one

No was the answer

Ay ay I thought as much was the reply He might as well have got
hold of a corner of the moon which I believe is more likely a great
deal more likely

Hold still a moment said the man who was looking over the edge of
the house

What's the matter now A gnat flew into your eye

No but I see him by Jove I see him

See who see who

Varney the vampire shouted the man I see him about half-way down
clinging like a fly to the wall Odd zounds I never saw the like
afore

Hurrah after him then boys

Not the same way if you please Go yourself and welcome but I won't
go that way

Just as you please said the man but what's good for the goose is
good for the gander is an old saying and so is Jack as good as his
master

So it may be but cuss me if you ain't a fool if you attempt that

The man made no reply but did as Varney had done before got over the
coping stone and then laid hold of the ivy but whether his weight was
heavier than Varney's or whether it was that the latter had loosened
the hold of the ivy or not but he had no sooner left go of the coping
stone than the ivy gave way and he was precipitated from the height of
about fifty feet to the earth a dreadful fall

There was a pause no one spoke The man lay motionless and dead he had
dislocated his neck

The fall had not however been without its effect upon Varney for the
man's heels struck him so forcibly on his head as he fell that he was
stunned and let go his hold and he too fell to the earth but not
many feet

He soon recovered himself and was staggering away when he was assailed
by those above with groans and curses of all kinds and then by stones
and tiles and whatever the mob could lay their hands upon

Some of these struck him and he was cut about in various places so
that he could hardly stand

The hoots and shouts of the mob above had now attracted those below to
the spot where Sir Francis Varney was trying to escape but he had not
gone far before the loud yells of those behind him told him that he was
again pursued

Half dead and almost wholly spent unarmed and defenceless he scarce
knew what to do whether to fly or to turn round and die as a refuge
from the greater evil of endeavouring to prolong a struggle which seemed
hopeless Instinct however urged him on at all risks and though he
could not go very far or fast yet on he went with the crowd after
him

Down with the vampire seize him hold him burn him he must be down
presently he can't stand

This gave them new hopes and rendered Varney's fate almost certain
They renewed their exertions to overtake him while he exerted himself
anew and with surprising agility considering how he had been employed
for more than two hours

There were some trees and hedges now that opposed the progress of both
parties The height of Sir Francis Varney gave him a great advantage
and had he been fresh he might have shown it to advantage in vaulting
over the hedges and ditches which he jumped when obliged and walked
through when he could

Every now and then the party in pursuit who had been behind him some
distance now they gained on him however they kept every now and
then losing sight of him among the trees and shrubs and he made direct
for a small wood hoping that when there he should to be able to
conceal himself for some time so as to throw his pursuers off the
track

They were well aware of this for they increased their speed and one or
two swifter of foot than the others got a-head of them and cried out
aloud as they ran 

Keep up keep up he's making for the wood

He can't stop there long there are too many of us to beat that cover
without finding our game Push lads he's our own now as sure as we
know he's on a-head

They did push on and came in full sight as they saw Sir Francis enter
the wood with what speed he could make but he was almost spent This
was a cheering sight to them and they were pretty certain he would not
leave the wood in the state he was then he must seek concealment

However they were mistaken for Sir Francis Varney as soon as he got
into the wood plunged into the thickest of it and then paused to gain
breath

So far safe he muttered but I have had a narrow escape they are
not yet done though and it will not be safe here long I must away
and seek shelter and safety elsewhere if I can curses on the hounds
that run yelping over the fields

He heard the shouts of his pursuers and prepared to quit the wood when
he thought the first had entered it

They will remain here some time in beating about he muttered that
is the only chance I have had since the pursuit curse them I say
again I may now get free this delay must save my life but nothing
else will

He moved away and at a slow and lazy pace left the wood and then
made his way across some fields towards some cottages that lay on the
left

The moon yet shone on the fields he could hear the shouts of the mob
as various parties went through the wood from one covert to another and
yet unable to find him

Then came a great shout upon his ears as though they had found out he
had left the wood This caused him to redouble his speed and fearful
lest he should be seen in the moonlight he leaped over the first fence
that he came to with almost the last effort he could make and then
staggered in at an open door through a passage into a front parlour
and there fell faint and utterly spent and speechless at the feet of
Flora Bannerworth




 LXXXVIII

THE RECEPTION OF THE vampire BY FLORA VARNEY SUBDUED


Illustration

We must say that the irruption into the house of the Bannerworths by Sir
Francis Varney was certainly unpremeditated by him for he knew not
into whose house he had thus suddenly rushed for refuge from the
numerous foes who were pursuing him with such vengeful ire It was a
strange and singular incident and one well calculated to cause the mind
to pause before it passed it by and consider the means to an end which
are sometimes as wide of the mark as it is in nature possible to be

But truth is stronger than fiction by far and the end of it was that
pressed on all sides by danger bleeding faint and exhausted he
rushed into the first house he came to and thus placed himself in the
very house of those whom he had brought to such a state of misfortune

Flora Bannerworth was seated at some embroidery to pass away an hour or
so and thus get over the tedium of time she was not thinking either
upon the unhappy past some trifling object or other engaged her
attention But what was her anguish when she saw a man staggering into
the room bleeding and bearing the marks of a bloody contest and
sinking at her feet

Her astonishment was far greater yet when she recognised that man to be
Sir Francis Varney

Save me save me Miss Bannerworth save me only you can save me
from the ruthless multitude which follows crying aloud for my blood

As he spoke he sank down speechless Flora was so much amazed not to
say terrified that she knew not what to do She saw Sir Francis a
suppliant at her feet a fugitive from his enemies who would show him
no mercy she saw all this at a moment's glance and yet she had not
recovered her speech and presence of mind enough to enable her to make
any reply to him

Save me Miss Flora Bannerworth save me he again said raising
himself on his hands I am beset hunted like a wild beast they seek
my life they have pursued me from one spot to another and I have
unwittingly intruded upon you You will save me I am sure your kindness
and goodness of heart will never permit me to be turned out among such a
crew of blood-thirsty butchers as those who pursue me are

Rise Sir Francis Varney said Flora after a moment's hesitation in
such an extremity as that which you are in it would be inhuman indeed
to thrust you out among your enemies

Oh it would said Varney I had thought until now I could have
faced such a mob until I was in this extremity and then disarmed and
thrown down bruised beaten and incapable of stemming such a torrent
I fled from one place to another till hunted from each and then
instinct alone urged me to greater exertion than before and here I
am this is now my last and only hope

Rise Sir Francis

You will not let me be torn out and slaughtered like an ox I am sure
you will not

Sir Francis we are incapable of such conduct you have sought refuge
here and shall find it as far as we are able to afford it to you

And your brother and 

Yes yes all who are here will do the same but here they come to
speak for themselves

As she spoke Mrs Bannerworth entered also Charles Holland who both
started on seeing the vampire present Sir Francis Varney who was too
weak to rise without assistance

Sir Francis Varney said Flora speaking to them as they entered has
sought refuge here his life is in peril and he has no other hope left
you will I am sure do what can be done for him

Mr Holland said Sir Francis I am as you may see by my condition
a fugitive and have been beaten almost to death instinct alone urged
me on to save my life and I unknowingly came in here

Rise Sir Francis said Charles Holland I am not one who would feel
any pleasure in seeing you become the victim of any brutal mob I am
sure there are none amongst us who would willingly do so You have
trusted to those who will not betray you

Thank you said Sir Francis faintly I thank you your conduct is
noble and Miss Bannerworth's especially so

Are you much hurt Sir Francis inquired Charles

I am much hurt but not seriously or dangerously but I am weak and
exhausted

Let me assist you to rise said Charles Holland

Thank you said Sir Francis as he accepted of the assistance and
when he stood up he found how incapable he really was for a child
might have grappled with him

I have been sore beset Mrs Bannerworth he said endeavouring to bow
to that lady and I have suffered much ill-usage I am not in such a
plight as I could wish to be seen in by ladies but my reasons for
coming will be an excuse for my appearance in such disorder

We will not say anything about that said Charles Holland under the
circumstances it could not be otherwise

It could not said Sir Francis as he took the chair Miss Flora
Bannerworth placed for him

I will not ask you for any explanation as to how this came about but
you need some restorative and rest

I think I suffer more from exhaustion than anything else The bruises I
have of course are not dangerous

Can you step aside a few moments said Mrs Bannerworth I will show
you where you can remove some of those stains and make yourself more
comfortable

Thank you madam thank you It will be most welcome to me I assure
you

Sir Francis rose up and with the aid of Charles Holland he walked to
the next room where he washed himself and arranged his dress as well
as it would admit of its being done

Mr Holland he said I cannot tell you how grateful I feel for this
I have been hunted from the house where you saw me From what source
they learned my abode my place of concealment I know not but they
found me out

I need hardly say Sir Francis that it could not have occurred through
me said Charles Holland

My young friend said Sir Francis I am quite sure you were not and
moreover I never for one moment suspected you No no some
accidental circumstance alone has been the cause I have been very
cautious I may say extremely so but at the same time living as I
have surrounded by enemies on all sides it is not to be wondered at
that I should be seen by some one and thus traced to my lair whither
they followed me at their leisure

They have been but too troublesome in this matter When they become a
little reasonable it will be a great miracle for when their passions
and fears are excited there is no end to the extremes they will
perpetrate

It is so said Varney as the history of these last few days amply
testifies to me I could never have credited the extent to which popular
excitement could be carried and the results it was likely to produce

It is an engine of very difficult control pursued Charles Holland
but what will raise it will not allay it but add fuel to the fire that
burns so fiercely already

True enough said Sir Francis

If you have done will you again step this way

Sir Francis Varney followed Charles Holland into the sitting-room and
sat down with them and before him was spread a light supper with some
good wine

Eat Sir Francis said Mrs Bannerworth Such a state as that in
which you are must of necessity produce great exhaustion and you
must require food and drink

Sir Francis bowed as well as he was able and even then sore and
bruised as he was fugitive as he had been he could not forget his
courtesy but it was not without an effort His equanimity was however
much disturbed by finding himself in the midst of the Bannerworths

I owe you a relation he said of what occurred to drive me from my
place of concealment

We should like to hear it if you are not too far fatigued to relate
it said Charles

I will I was sitting at the top of that house in which I sought to
hide myself when I heard sounds come that were of a very suspicious
nature but did not believe that it could happen that they had
discovered my lurking-place far from it though of late I had been
habitually cautious and suspicious yet I thought I was safe till I
heard the noise of a multitude coming towards me I could not be
mistaken in it for the sounds are so peculiar that they are like
nothing else I heard them coming

I moved not and when they surrounded the house as far as was
practicable they gave an immense shout and made the welkin ring with
the sound

I heard a confused noise at a distance remarked Flora but I had no
idea that anything serious was contemplated I imagined it was some
festival among some trade or portion of the townspeople who were
shouting from joy

Oh dear no said Sir Francis but I am not surprised at the mistake
because there are such occurrences occasionally but whenever the mob
gained any advantage upon me they shouted and when I was able to oppose
them with effect they groaned at me most horribly

The deuce said Charles the sound suppose serves to express their
feelings and to encourage each other

Something of the sort I dare say said Varney but at length after
defending the house with all the desperation that despair imparted to
me I was compelled to fly from floor to floor until I had reached the
roof there they followed me and I was compelled again to fly House
after house they followed me to until I could go no farther said
Varney

How did you escape

Fortunately I saw some ivy growing and creeping over the coping-stones
and by grasping that I got over the side and so let myself down by
degrees as well as I was able

Good heavens what a dreadful situation exclaimed Flora it is
really horrible

I could not do it again under I think any circumstances

Not the same said Mrs Bannerworth

I really doubt if I could said Varney The truth is the excitement
of the moment was great and I at that moment thought of nothing but
getting away

The same circumstances the same fear of death could hardly be
produced in me again and I am unable to account for the phenomenon on
this occasion

Your escape was very narrow indeed said Flora it makes me shudder
to think of the dangers you have gone through it is really terrible to
think of it

You said Sir Francis are young and susceptible and generous in
your disposition You can feel for me and do but how little I could
have expected it it is impossible to say but your sympathy sinks into
my mind and causes such emotions as never can be erased from my soul

But to proceed You may guess how dreadful was my position by the fact
that the first man who attempted to get over tore the ivy away and fell
striking me in his fall he was killed and I thrown down and stunned I
then made for the wood closely pursued and got into it then I baffled
them they searched the wood and I went through it I then ran across
the country to these houses here I got over the fence and in at the
back door

Did they see you come inquired Charles Holland

I cannot say but I think that they did not I heard them give a loud
shout more than once when on this side of the wood

You did How far from here were you when you heard the shouts
inquired Mrs Bannerworth

I was close here and as I jumped over the fence I heard them shout
again but I think they cannot see so far the night was moonlight to
be sure but that is all the shadow of the hedge and the distance
together would make it if not impossible at least very improbable

That is very likely said Mrs Bannerworth

In that case said Charles Holland you are safe here for none will
suspect your being concealed here

It is the last place I should myself have thought of said Varney
and I may say the last place I would knowingly have come to but had I
before known enough of you I should have been well assured of your
generosity and have freely come to claim your aid and shelter which
accident has so strangely brought me to be a candidate for and which you
have so kindly awarded me

The night is wearing away said Flora and Sir Francis is doubtless
fatigued to an excess sleep I dare say will be most welcome to him

It will indeed Miss Bannerworth said Varney but I can do that
under any circumstances do not let me put you to any inconvenience a
chair and at any hour will serve me for sleep

We cannot do for you what we would wish said Flora looking at her
mother but something better than that at all events we can and will
provide for you

I know not how to thank you said Sir Francis Varney I assure you
of late I have not been luxuriously lodged and the less trouble I give
you the greater I shall esteem the favour

The hour was late and Sir Francis Varney before another half hour had
elapsed was consigned to his own reflections in a small but neat room
there to repose his bruised and battered carcass and court the
refreshing influence of sleep

His reflections were for nearly an hour of the most contradictory
character some one passion was trying to overcome the other but he
seemed quite subdued

I could not have expected this he muttered Flora Bannerworth has
the soul of a heroine I deserved not such a reception from them and
yet in my hour of utmost need they have received me like a favoured
friend and yet all their misfortunes have taken their origin from me I
am the cause of all

Filled with these thoughts he fell asleep he slept till morning broke
He was not disturbed it seemed as though the influence of sleep was
sweeter far there in the cottage of the Bannerworths than ever he had
before received

It was late on that morning before Sir Francis rose and then only
through hearing the family about and having performed his toilet so
far as circumstances permitted he descended and entered the
front-parlour the room he had been in the night before

Flora Bannerworth was already there indeed breakfast was waiting the
appearance of Sir Francis Varney

Good morning Miss Bannerworth said Sir Francis bowing with his
usual dignified manner but in the kindest and sincerest way he was able
to assume

Good morning Sir Francis said Flora rising to receive him and she
could not avoid looking at him as he entered the room I hope you have
had a pleasant night

It has been the best night's rest I have had for some time Miss
Bannerworth I assure you I have to express my gratitude to you for so
much kindness I have slept well and soundly

I am glad to hear it

I think yet I shall escape the search of these people who have hunted
me from so many places

I hope you may indeed Sir Francis

You Miss Bannerworth and do you hope I may escape the vengeance of
these people the populace

I do Sir Francis most sincerely hope so Why should I wish evil to
you especially at their hands

Sir Francis did not speak for a minute or two and then he said turning
full upon Flora 

I don't know why Miss Bannerworth that I should think so but perhaps
it is because there are peculiar circumstances connected with myself
that have made me feel conscious that I have not deserved so much
goodness at your hands

You have not deserved any evil Sir Francis we could not do that if it
were in our power we would do you a service at any time

You have done so Miss Bannerworth the greatest that can be performed
You have saved my life

At that moment Charles Holland entered and Sir Francis bowed as he
said 

I hope you Mr Holland have slept as well and passed as good a night
as I have passed

I am glad you at least have passed a quiet one said Charles
Holland you I dare say feel all the better for it How do you feel
yourself Are you much hurt

Not at all not at all said Sir Francis Varney Only a few bruises
and so forth some of which as you may perceive do not add to one's
personal appearance A week or two's quiet would rid me of them At all
events I would it may do the same with my enemies

I wish they were as easily gotten rid of myself said Charles but as
that cannot be we must endeavour to baffle them in the best way we
may

I owe a debt to you I shall never be able to repay but where there is
a will they say there is a way and if the old saying be good for
anything I need not despair though the way is by no means apparent at
present

Time is the magician said Flora whose wand changes all things the
young to the aged and the aged to nothing

Certainly that is true said Varney and many such changes have I
seen My mind is stored with such events but this is sadness and I
have cause to rejoice

   

The breakfast was passed off in pleasing conversation and Varney found
himself much at home with the Bannerworths whose calm and even tenour
was quite new to him

He could not but admit the charms of such a life as that led by the
Bannerworths but what it must have been when they were supplied by
ample means with nothing to prey upon their minds and no fearful
mystery to hang on and weigh down their spirits he could scarcely
imagine

They were amiable accomplished they were in the same mind at all times
and nothing seemed to ruffle them and when night came he could not but
acknowledge to himself that he had never formed half the opinion of them
they were deserving of

Of course during that day he was compelled to lie close so as not to be
seen by any one save the family He sat in a small room which was
overlooked by no other in the neighbourhood and he remained quiet
sometimes conversing and sometimes reading but at the same time ever
attentive to the least sound that appeared at all of a character to
indicate the approach of persons for any purpose whatever

At supper time he spoke to Flora and to Charles Holland saying 

There are certain matters connected with myself I may say with you
now sure all that has happened will make it so of which you would be
glad to hear some thing

You mean upon the same subject upon which I had some conversation with
you a day or two back

Yes the same Allow me one week and you shall know all I will then
relate to you that which you so much desire to know one week and all
shall be told

Well said Charles Holland this has not been exacted from you as the
price of your safety but you can choose your own time of course what
you promise is most desired for it will render those happy who now are
much worse than they were before these occurrences took place

I am aware of all that grant me but one week and then you shall be
made acquainted with all

I am satisfied Sir Francis said Flora but while here under our
roof we should never have asked you a question

Of this Miss Bannerworth the little I have seen of you assures me you
would not do so however I am the more inclined to make it I am under
so deep an obligation to you all that I can never repay it

                                   

Sir Francis Varney retired to rest that night his promise to the
Bannerworths filled his mind with many reflections the insecurity of
his own position and the frail tenure which he even held in the hands
of those whom he had most injured

This produced a series of reflections of a grave and melancholy nature
and he sat by his window watching the progress of the clouds as they
appeared to chase each other over the face of the scene now casting a
shade over the earth and then banishing the shadows and throwing a
gentle light over the earth's surface which was again chased away and
shadows again fell upon the scene below

How long he had sat there in melancholy musing he knew not but suddenly
he was aroused from his dreams by a voice that shook the skies and
caused him to start to his feet

Hurrah hurrah hurrah shouted the mob which had silently
collected around the cottage of the Bannerworths

Curses muttered Sir Francis as he again sank in his chair and
struck his head with his hand I am hunted to death they will not
leave me until my body has graced a cross-road

Hurrah down with the vampire pull him out

Then came an instant knocking at the doors and the people on the
outside made so great a din that it seemed as though they contemplated
knocking the house down at once without warning the inmates that they
waited there

There was a cessation for about a minute when one of the family
hastened to the door and inquired what was wanted

Varney the vampire was the reply

You must seek him elsewhere

We will search this place before we go further replied a man

But he is not here

We have reason to believe otherwise Open the door and let us in no
one shall be hurt or one single object in the house but we must come
in and search for the vampire

Come to-morrow then

That will not do said the voice open or we force our way in
without more notice

At the same a tremendous blow was bestowed upon the door and then much
force was used to thrust it in A consultation was suddenly held among
the inmates as to what was to be done but no one could advise and
each was well aware of the utter impossibility of keeping the mob out

I do not see what is to become of me said Sir Francis Varney
suddenly appearing before them You must let them in there is no
chance of keeping them off neither can you conceal me You will have no
place save one that will be sacred from their profanation

And which is that

Flora's own room

All started at the thought that Flora's chamber could in any way be
profaned by any such presence as Sir Francis Varney's

However the doors below were suddenly burst open amid loud cries from
the populace who rushed in in great numbers and began to search the
lower rooms immediately

All is lost said Sir Francis Varney as he dashed away and rushed to
the chamber of Flora who alarmed at the sounds that were now filling
the house stood listening to them

Miss Bannerworth  began Varney

Sir Francis

Yes it is indeed I Miss Bannerworth hear me for one moment

What is the matter

I am again in peril in more imminent peril than before my life is not
worth a minute's purchase unless you save me You and you alone can
now save me Oh Miss Bannerworth if ever pity touched your heart save
me from those only whom I now fear I could meet death in any shape but
that in which they will inflict it upon me Hear their execrations
below

Death to the vampire death to Varney burn him run a stake through
his body

Illustration

What can I do Sir Francis

Admit me to your chamber

Sir Francis are you aware of what you are saying

I am well It is a request which you would justly scorn to reply to
but now my life recollect you have saved me once my life do not now
throw away the boon you have so kindly bestowed Save me Miss
Bannerworth

It is not possible I 

Nay Miss Bannerworth do you imagine this is a time for ceremony or
the observances of polished life On my honour you run no risk of
censure

Where is Varney Where is the vampire He ain't far off

Hear hear them Miss Bannerworth They are now at the foot of the
stairs Not a moment to lose One minute more and I am in the hands of
a crew that has no mercy

Hurrah upstairs He's not below Upstairs neighbours we shall have
him yet

These words sounded on the stairs half-a-dozen more steps and Varney
would be seen It was a miracle he was not heard begging for his life

Varney cast a look of despair at the stairhead and felt for his sword
but it was not there he had lost it He struck his head with his
clenched hand and was about to rush upon his foes when he heard the
lock turn he looked and saw the door opened gently and Flora stood
there he passed in and sank cowering into a chair at the other end of
the room behind some curtains

The door was scarcely shut ere some tried to force it and then a loud
knocking came at the door

Open open we want Varney the vampire Open or we will burst it
open

Flora did open it but stood resolutely in the opening and held up her
hand to impose silence

Are you men that you can come thus to force yourselves upon the
privacy of a female Is there nothing in the town or house that you
must intrude in numbers into a private apartment Is no place sacred
from you

But ma'am miss we only want Varney the vampire

And can you find him nowhere but in a female's bedroom Shame on you
shame on you Have you no sisters wives or mothers that you act
thus

He's not there you may be sure of that Jack said a gruff voice
Let the lady be in quiet she's had quite enough trouble with him to
sicken her of a vampire You may be sure that's the last place to find
him in

With this they all turned away and Flora shut the door and locked it
upon them and Varney was safe

You have saved me said Varney

Hush said Flora Speak not there maybe some one listening

Sir Francis Varney stood in the attitude of one listening most anxiously
to catch some sounds the moon fell across his face and gave it a
ghastly hue that added to his natural paleness and wounds gave him an
almost unearthly aspect

The sounds grew more and more distant the shouts and noise of men
traversing the apartments subsided and gradually the place became
restored to its original silence The mob after having searched every
other part of the house and not finding the object of their search
they concluded that he was not there but must have made his escape
before

                                   

This most desperate peril of Sir Francis Varney seemed to have more
effect upon him than anything that had occurred during his most strange
and most eventful career

When he was assured that the riotous mob that had been so intent upon
his destruction was gone and that he might emerge from his place of
concealment he did so with an appearance of such utter exhaustion that
the Bannerworth family could not but look upon him as a being who was
near his end

At any time his countenance as we long have had occasion to remark was
a strange and unearthly looking one but when we come to superadd to the
strangeness of his ordinary appearance the traces of deep mental
emotion we may well say that Varney's appearance was positively of the
most alarming character

When he was seated in the ordinary sitting apartment of the
Bannerworths he drew a long sighing breath and placing his hand upon
his heart he said in a faint tone of voice 

It beats now laboriously but it will soon cease its pulsations for
ever

These words sounded absolutely prophetic there was about them such a
solemn aspect and he looked at the same time that he uttered them so
much like one whose mortal race was run and who was now a candidate for
the grave

Do not speak so despairingly said Charles Holland remember that if
your life has been one of errors hitherto how short a space of time may
suffice to redeem some of them at least and the communication to me
which you have not yet completed may to some extent have such an
effect

No no It may contribute to an act of justice but it can do no good
to me And yet do not suppose that because such is my impression that I
mean to hesitate in finishing to you that communication

I rejoice to hear you say so and if you would now that you must be
aware of what good feelings towards you we are all animated with remove
the bar of secrecy from the communication I should esteem it a great
favour

Varney appeared to be considering for a few moments and then he said 

Well well Let the secrecy no longer exist Have it removed at once I
will no longer seek to maintain it Tell all Charles Holland tell
all

Thus empowered by the mysterious being Charles Holland related briefly
what Varney had already told him and then concluded by saying 

That is all that I have myself as yet been made aware of and I now
call upon Sir Francis Varney to finish his narration

I am weak said Varney and scarcely equal to the task but yet I
will not shrink from the promise that I have made You have been the
preservers of my life and more particularly to you Flora Bannerworth
am I indebted for an existence which otherwise must have been
sacrificed upon the altar of superstition

But you will recollect Master Varney said the admiral who had sat
looking on for some time in silent wonder you must recollect Master
Varney that the people are after all not so much to blame for their
superstition because whether you are a vampire or not and I don't
pretend to come to a positive opinion now you took good care to
persuade them you were

I did said Varney with a shudder but why did I

Well you know best

It was then because I did believe and do believe that there is
something more than natural about my strangely protracted existence but
we will waive that point and before my failing strength for it
appears to me to be failing completely prevents me from doing so let
me relate to you the continued particulars of the circumstances that
made me what I am

Flora Bannerworth although she had heard before from the lips of
Charles Holland the to her dreadful fact that her father in addition
to having laid violent hands upon his own life was a murderer now that
that fearful circumstance was related more publicly felt a greater pang
than she had done when it was whispered to her in the accents of pure
affection and softened down by a gentleness of tone which Charles
Holland's natural delicacy would not allow him to use even to her whom
he loved so well in the presence of others

She let her beautiful face be hidden by her hands and she wept as she
listened to the sad detail

Varney looked inquiringly in the countenance of Charles Holland
because having given him leave to make Flora acquainted with the
circumstance he was rather surprised at the amount of emotion which it
produced in her

Charles Holland answered the appealing look by saying 

Flora is already aware of the facts but it naturally affects her much
to hear them now repeated in the presence of others and those too
towards whom she cannot feel 

What Charles Holland was going to say was abruptly stopped short by the
admiral who interposed exclaiming 

Why what do you mean you son of a sea cook The presence of who do
you mean Do you mean to say that I don't feel for Miss Flora bless her
heart quite as much as a white-faced looking swab like you Why I
shall begin to think you are only fit for a marine

Nay uncle now do not put yourself out of temper You must be well
aware that I could not mean anything disrespectful to you You should
not suppose such a state of things possible and although perhaps I
did not express myself so felicitously as I might yet what I intended
to say was 

Oh bother what you intended to say You go on Mr vampire with your
story I want to know what became of it all just you get on as quick as
you can and let us know what you did after the man was murdered

When the dreadful deed was committed said Varney and our victim lay
weltering in his blood and had breathed his last we stood like men who
for the first time were awakened to the frightful consequences of what
they had done

I saw by the dim light that hovered round us a great change come over
the countenance of Marmaduke Bannerworth and he shook in every limb

This soon passed away however and the powerful and urgent necessity
which arose of avoiding the consequences of the deed that we had done
restored us to ourselves We stooped and took from the body the
ill-gotten gains of the gambler They amounted to an immense sum and I
said to Marmaduke Bannerworth 

'Take you the whole of this money and proceed to your own home with it
where you will be least suspected Hide it in some place of great
secrecy and to-morrow I will call upon you when we will divide it and
will consider of some means of safely exchanging the notes for gold'

He agreed to this and placed the money in his pocket after which it
became necessary that we should dispose of the body which if we did
not quickly remove must in a few hours be discovered and so
perchance accompanied by other criminating circumstances become a
frightful evidence against us and entail upon us all those consequences
of the deed which we were so truly anxious to escape from

It is ever the worst part of the murderer's task that after he has
struck the blow that has deprived his victim of existence it becomes
his frightful duty to secrete the corpse which with its dead eyes
ever seems to be glaring upon him such a world of reproach

That it is which should make people pause ere they dipped their hands
in the blood of others and that it is which becomes the first
retribution that the murderer has to endure for the deep crime that he
has committed

We tore two stakes from a hedge and with their assistance we contrived
to dig a very superficial hole such a hole as was only sufficient by
placing a thin coating of earth over it to conceal the body of the
murdered man

And then came the loathsome task of dragging him into it a task full
of horror and from which we shrunk aghast but it had to be done and
therefore we stooped and grasping the clothes as best we might we
dragged the body into the chasm we had prepared for its reception Glad
were we then to be enabled to throw the earth upon it and to stamp upon
it with such vehemence as might well be supposed to actuate men deeply
anxious to put out of sight some dangerous and loathsome object

When we had completed this and likewise gathered handsfull of dust
from the road and dry leaves and such other matter to sprinkle upon
the grave so as to give the earth an appearance of not having been
disturbed we looked at each other and breathed from our toil

Then and not till then was it that we remembered that among other
things which the gambler had won of Marmaduke were the deeds belonging
to the Dearbrook property

The Dearbrook property exclaimed Henry Bannerworth I know that
there was a small estate going by that name which belonged to our
family but I always understood that long ago my father had parted with
it

Yes it was mortgaged for a small sum a sum not a fourth part of its
value and it had been redeemed by Marmaduke Bannerworth not for the
purpose of keeping it but in order that he might sell it outright and
so partially remedy his exhausted finances

I was not aware of that returned Henry

Doubtless you were not for of late I mean for the twelve months or so
preceding your father's death you know he was much estranged from all
the family so that you none of you knew much of what he was doing
except that he was carrying on a very wild and reckless career such as
was sure to end in dishonour and poverty but I tell you he had the
title deeds of the Dearbrook property and that they were only got from
him along with everything else of value that he possessed at the
gaming-table by the man who paid such a fearful penalty for his
success

It was not until after the body was completely buried and we had
completed all our precautions for more effectually hiding it from
observation that we recollected the fact of those important papers
being in his possession It was Marmaduke Bannerworth who first
remembered it and he exclaimed 

'By Heaven we have buried the title deeds of the property and we
shall have again to exhume the corpse for the purpose of procuring
them'

Now those deeds were nothing to me and repugnant as I had felt from
the first to having anything whatever to do with the dead body it was
not likely that I would again drag it from the earth for such an object

'Marmaduke Bannerworth I said you can do what you please and take
the consequences of what you do but I will not again if I can help it
look upon the face of that corpse It is too fearful a sight to
contemplate again You have a large sum of money and what need you care
now for the title deeds of a property comparatively insignificant'

'Well well he said I will not at the present time disturb the
remains I will wait to see if anything should arise from the fact of
the murder if it should turn out that no suspicion of any kind is
excited but that all is still and quiet I can then take measures to
exhume the corpse and recover those papers which certainly are
important'

By this time the morning was creeping on apace and we thought it
prudent to leave the spot We stood at the end of the lane for a few
moments conversing and those moments were the last in which I ever saw
Marmaduke Bannerworth

Answer me a question said Henry

I will ask me what you please I will answer it

Was it you that called at Bannerworth Hall after my father's
melancholy death and inquired for him

I did and when I heard of the deed that he had done I at once left
in order to hold counsel with myself as to what I should do to obtain at
least a portion of the property one-half of which it was understood
was to have been mine I heard what had been the last words used by
Marmaduke Bannerworth on the occasion of his death and they were amply
sufficient to let me know what had been done with the money at all
events so far as regards the bestowal of it in some secret place and
from that moment the idea of by some means or another getting the
exclusive possession of it never forsook my mind

I thought over the matter by day and by night and with the exception
of having a knowledge of the actual hiding-place of the money I could
see in the clearest possible manner how the whole affair had been
transacted There can be no doubt but that Marmaduke Bannerworth had
reached home safely with the large sum of which he had become possessed
and that he had hidden it securely which was but an ordinary measure of
precaution when we come to consider how the property had been obtained

Then I suspect that being alone and left to the gloom of his own
miserable thoughts they reverted so painfully to the past that he was
compelled to drink deeply for the purpose of drowning reflection

The natural consequence of this in his state was that partial
insanity supervened and at a moment when frenzy rose far above
reflection he must have committed the dreadful act which hurried him
instantaneously to eternity

Yes said Henry it must have been so you have guessed truly He did
on that occasion drink an immense quantity of wine but instead of
stilling the pangs of remorse it must have increased them and placed
him in such a frenzied condition of intellect that he found it
impossible to withstand the impulse of it unless by the terrific act
which ended his existence

Yes and which at once crushed all my expectations of the large fortune
which was to have been mine for even the one-half of the sum which had
been taken from the gamester's pocket would have been sufficient to have
enabled me to live for the future in affluence

I became perfectly maddened at the idea that so large a sum had passed
out of my hands I constantly hovered about Bannerworth Hall hoping and
expecting that something might arise which would enable me to get
admittance to it and make an active search through its recesses for the
hidden treasure

All my exertions were in vain I could hit upon no scheme whatever and
at length wearied and exhausted I was compelled to proceed to London
for the sake of a subsistence It is only in that great metropolis that
such persons as myself destitute of real resources but infinitely
reckless as regards the means by which they acquire a subsistence can
hope to do so Once again therefore I plunged into the vortex of
London life and proceeded heedless of the criminality of what I was
about to cater for myself by robbery or indeed in any manner which
presented a prospect of success It was during this career of mine that
I became associated with some of the most desperate characters of the
time and the offences we committed were of that daring character that
it could not be wondered at eventually so formidable a gang of
desperadoes must be by force broken up

It so occurred but unknown to us that the police resolved upon making
one of the most vigorous efforts to put an end to the affair and in
consequence a watch was set upon every one of our movements

The result of this was as might have been expected our complete
dispersion and the arrest of some our members and among them myself

I knew my fate almost from the first Our depredations had created such
a sensation that the legislature even had made it a matter of
importance that we should be suppressed and it was an understood thing
among the judges that the severest penalties of the law should be
inflicted upon any one of the gang who might be apprehended and
convicted

My trial scarcely occupied an hour and then I was convicted and
sentenced to execution with an intimation from the judge that it would
be perfectly absurd of me to dream for one moment of a remission of
that sentence

In this state of affairs and seeing nothing but death before me I
gave myself up to despair and narrowly missed cheating the hangman of
his victim

More dead than alive I was however dragged out to be judicially
murdered and I shall never forget the crowd of frightful sensations
that came across my mind upon that terrific occasion

It seemed as if my fate had then reached its climax and I have really
but a dim recollection of the terrible scene

I remember something of the confused murmur arising from an immense
throng of persons I remember looking about me and seeing nothing but
what appeared to me an immense sea of human heads and then suddenly I
heard a loud roar of execration burst from the multitude

I shrunk back terrified and it did indeed seem to me a brutal thing
thus to roar and shout at a man who was brought out to die I soon
however found that the mob who came to see such a spectacle was not so
debased as I imagined but that it was at the hangman who had suddenly
made his appearance on the scaffold at whom they raised that fearful
yell

Some one I think it was one of the sheriffs must have noticed that I
was labouring under the impression that the cry from the mob was
levelled at me for he spoke saying 

'It is at the hangman they shout and he indicated with his finger
that public functionary In my mind's eye I think I see him now and I
am certain that I shall never forget the expression of his face It was
perfectly fearful and afterwards when I learned who and what he was I
was not surprised that he should feel so acutely the painfully degrading
office which he had to perform

The fatal rope was in a few minutes adjusted to my neck I felt its
pressure and I heard the confused sounds of the monotonous voice of the
clergyman as he muttered some prayers that I must confess sounded to
me at the time like a mockery of human suffering

Then suddenly there was a loud shout I felt the platform give way
beneath my feet I tried to utter a yell of agony but could not it
seemed to me as if I was encompassed by fire and then sensation left
me and I knew no more

                                   

The next feelings of existence that came over me consisted in a
frightful tingling sensation throughout my veins and I felt myself
making vain efforts to scream All the sensations of a person suffering
from a severe attack of nightmare came across me and I was in such an
agony that I inwardly prayed for death to release me from such a cruel
state of suffering Then suddenly the power to utter a sound came to me
and I made use of it well for the piercing shriek I uttered must have
struck terror into the hearts of all who heard it since it appalled
even myself

Then I suppose I must have fainted but when I recovered consciousness
again I found myself upon a couch and a man presenting some stimulus
to me in a cup I could not distinguish objects distinctly but I heard
him say Drink and you will be better'

I did drink for a raging thirst consumed me and then I fell into a
sound sleep which I was afterwards told lasted nearly twenty-four
hours and when I recovered from that I heard again the same voice that
had before spoken to me asking me how I was

I turned in the direction of the sound and as my vision was now
clearer I could see that it was the hangman whose face had made upon
the scaffold such an impression upon me an impression which I then
considered my last in this world but which turned out not to be such by
many a mingled one of pain and pleasure since

It was some time before I could speak and when I did it was only in a
few muttered words to ask what had happened and where I was

'Do you not remember he said that you were hanged'

'I do I do was my reply Is this the region of damned souls'

'No you are still in this world however strange you may think it
Listen to me and I will briefly tell you how it is that you have come
back again as it were from the very grave to live and walk about
among the living

I listened to him with a strange and rapt attention and then he told
how a young and enthusiastic medical man had been anxious to try some
experiments with regard to the restoration of persons apparently dead
and he proceeded to relate how it was that he had given ear to the
solicitations of the man and had consented to bring my body after it
was hung for him to experiment upon He related how the doctor had been
successful but how he was so terrified at his own success that he
hastily fled and had left London no one knowing whither he had gone

I listened to this with the most profound attention and then he
concluded by saying to me 

'There can be no doubt but my duty requires of me to give you up again
to the offended laws of your country I will not however do that if
you will consent to an arrangement that I shall propose to you'

I asked him what the arrangement was and he said that if I would
solemnly bind myself to pay to him a certain sum per annum he would
keep my secret and forsaking his calling as hangman endeavour to do
something that should bring with it pleasanter results I did so
solemnly promise him and I have kept my word By one means or another I
have succeeded in procuring the required amount and now he is no more

I believe cried Henry that he has fallen a victim to the blind fury
of the populace

You are right he has so and accordingly I am relieved from the burden
of those payments but it matters little for now I am so near the tomb
myself that together with all my obligations I shall soon be beyond
the reach of mortal cavilling

You need not think so Varney you must remember that you are at
present suffering from circumstances the pressure of which will soon
pass away and then you will resume your wonted habits

What did you do next said the admiral Let's know all while you are
about it

I remained at the hangman's house for some time until all fear of
discovery was over and then he removed me to a place of greater
security providing me from his own resources with the means of
existence until I had fully recovered my health and then he told me to
shift for myself

During my confinement though I had not been idle mentally for I
concocted a plan by which I should be enabled not only to live well
myself but to pay to the hangman whose name was Mortimore the annual
sum I had agreed upon I need not go into the details of this plan Of
course it was neither an honest nor respectable one but it succeeded
and I soon found myself in a position to enable me thereby to keep my
engagement as well as to supply me with means of plotting and planning
for my future fortunes

I had never for a moment forgotten that so large a sum of money was
somewhere concealed about Bannerworth Hall and I still looked forward
to obtaining it by some means or another

It was in this juncture of affairs that one night I was riding on
horseback through a desolate part of England The moon was shining
sweetly as I came to a broad stream of water across which about a
mile further on I saw that there was a bridge but being unwilling to
waste time by riding up to it and fancying by the lazy ripple of the
waters that the river was not shallow I plunged my horse boldly into
the stream

When we reached its centre some sudden indisposition must have seized
the horse for instead of swimming on well and gallantly as it had done
before it paused for a moment and then plunged headlong into the
torrent

I could not swim and so for a second time death with all its
terrors appeared to be taking possession of me The waters rolled over
my head gurgling and hissing in my ears and then all was past I know
no more until I found myself lying upon a bright green meadow and the
full beams of the moon shining upon me

I was giddy and sick but I rose and walked slowly away each moment
gathering fresh strength and from that time to this I never discovered
how I came to be rescued from the water and lying upon that green bank
It has ever been a mystery to me and I expect it ever will

Then from that moment the idea that I had a sort of charmed life came
across me and I walked about with an impression that such was the case
until I came across a man who said that he was a Hungarian and who was
full of strange stories of vampires Among other things he told me that
a vampire could not be drowned for that the waters would cast him upon
its banks and if the moonbeams fell upon him he would be restored to
life

This was precisely my story and from that moment I believed myself to
be one of those horrible but charmed beings doomed to such a
protracted existence The notion grew upon me day by day and hour by
hour until it became quite a fixed and strong belief and I was
deceiving no one when I played the horrible part that has been
attributed to me

But you don't mean to say that you believe you are a vampire now said
the admiral

I say nothing and know not what to think I am a desperate man and
what there is at all human in me strange to say all of you whom I
sought to injure have awakened

Heed not that said Henry but continue your narrative We have
forgiven everything and that ought to suffice to quiet your mind upon
such a subject

I will continue and believe me I will conceal nothing from you I
look upon the words I am now uttering as a full candid and free
confession and therefore it shall be complete

The idea struck me that if by taking advantage of my supposed
preternatural gifts I could drive you from Bannerworth Hall I should
have it to myself to hunt through at my leisure and possibly find the
treasure I had heard from Marmaduke Bannerworth some slight allusion to
concealing the money behind a picture that was in a bed-room called the
panelled chamber By inquiry I ascertained that in that bed-room slept
Flora Bannerworth

I had resolved however at first to try pacific measures and
accordingly as you are well aware I made various proposals to you to
purchase or to rent Bannerworth Hall the whole of which you rejected
so that I found myself compelled to adopt the original means that had
suggested themselves to me and endeavour to terrify you from the house

By prowling about I made myself familiar with the grounds and with
all the plan of the residence and then one night made my appearance in
Flora's chamber by the window

But how do you account said Charles Holland for your extraordinary
likeness to the portrait

It is partly natural for I belong to a collateral branch of the
family and it was previously arranged I had seen the portrait in
Marmaduke Bannerworth's time and I knew some of its peculiarities and
dress sufficiently well to imitate them I calculated upon producing a
much greater effect by such an imitation and it appears that I was not
wrong for I did produce it to the full

You did indeed said Henry and if you did not bring conviction to
our minds that you were what you represented yourself to be you at
least staggered our judgments upon the occasion and left us in a
position of great doubt and difficulty

I did I did all that I know I did and by pursuing that line of
conduct I at last I presume entirely forced you from the house

That you did

Flora fainted when I entered her chamber and the moment I looked upon
her sweet countenance my heart smote me for what I was about but I
solemnly aver that my lips never touched her and that beyond the
fright she suffered nothing from Varney the vampire

And have you succeeded said Henry in your object now

No the treasure has yet to be found Mortimore the hangman followed
me into the house guessing my intention and indulging a hope that he
would succeed in sharing with me its proceeds But he as well as
myself was foiled and nothing came of the toilsome and anxious search
but disappointment and bitterness

Then it is supposed that the money is still concealed

I hope so I hope as well that it will be discovered by you and
yours for surely none can have a better right to it than you who have
suffered so much on its account

And yet remarked Henry I cannot help thinking it is too securely
hidden from us The picture has been repeatedly removed from its place
and produced no results so that I fear we have little to expect from
any further or more protracted research

I think said Varney that you have everything to expect The words
of the dying Marmaduke Bannerworth you may depend were not spoken in
vain and I have every reason to believe that sooner or later you
must without question become the possessors of that sum

But ought we rightly to hold it

Who ought more rightly to hold it said Varney answer me that

That's a sensible enough idea of your's said the admiral and if you
were twice over a vampire I would tell you so It's a very sensible
idea I should like to know who has more right to it than those who have
had such a world of trouble about it

Well well said Henry we must not dispute as yet about a sum of
money that may really never come to hand For my own part I have little
to hope for in the matter but certainly nothing shall be spared on
my part to effect such a thorough search of the Hall as shall certainly
bring it to light if it be in existence

I presume Sir Francis Varney said Charles Holland that you have
now completed your narrative

I have After events are well known to you And now I have but to lie
down and die with the hope of finding that rest and consolation in the
tomb which has been denied me hitherto in this world My life has been a
stormy one and full of the results of angry passions I do hope now
that for the short time I have to live I shall know something like
serenity and die in peace

You may depend Varney that as long as you have an asylum with us
said the admiral and that you may have as long as you like you may
be at peace I consider that you have surrendered at discretion and
under such circumstances an enemy always deserves honourable treatment
and always gets it on board such a ship as this

There you go again said Jack calling the house a ship

What's that to you if I were to call it a bowsprit Ain't I your
captain you lubber and so sure to be right while you are wrong in
the natural order of things But you go and lay down Master Varney and
rest yourself for you seem completely done up

Varney did look fearfully exhausted and with the assistance of Henry
and Charles he went into another apartment and laid down upon a couch
showing great symptoms of debility and want of power

And now it was a calm Varney's stay at the cottage of the Bannerworths
was productive of a different mood of mind than ever he had possessed
before He looked upon them in a very different manner to what he had
been used to He had moreover considerably altered prospects there
could not be the same hopes and expectations that he once had He was an
altered man He saw in the Bannerworths those who had saved his life
and who without doubt had possessed an opinion not merely obnoxious
to him but must have had some fearful misgivings concerning his
character and that too of a nature that usually shuts out all hope of
being received into any family

But in the hour of his need when his life was in danger no one else
would have done what they had done for him especially when so
relatively placed

Moreover he had been concealed when to do so was both dangerous and
difficult and then it was done by Flora Bannerworth herself

Time flew by The mode of passing time at the cottage was calm and
serene Varney had seldom witnessed anything like it but at the same
time he felt more at ease than ever he had he was charmed with the
society of Flora in fact with the whole of the little knot of
individuals who there collected together from what he saw he was
gratified in their society and it seemed to alleviate his mental
disquiet and the sense he must feel of his own peculiar position But
Varney became ill The state of mind and body he had been in for some
time past might be the cause of it He had been much harassed and
hunted from place to place There was not a moment in which his life was
not in danger and he had moreover more than one case received some
bodily injuries bruises and contusions of a desperate character and
yet he would take no notice of them but allow them to get well again
as best they could

Illustration

His escapes and injuries had made a deep impression upon his mind and
had no doubt a corresponding effect upon his body and Varney became
very ill

Flora Bannerworth did all that could be done for one in his painful
position and this greatly added to the depths of thought that
occasionally beset him and he could scarcely draw one limb after the
other

He walked from room to room in the twilight at which time he had more
liberty permitted him than at any other because there was not the same
danger in his doing so for if once seen there could be no manner of
doubt but he would have been pursued until he was destroyed when no
other means of escape were at hand and Varney himself felt that there
could be no chance of his again escaping from them for his physical
powers were fast decaying he was not in fact the same man

He came out into the parlour from the room in which he had been seated
during the day Flora and her mother were there while Charles Holland
and Henry Bannerworth had both at that moment entered the apartment

Good evening Miss Bannerworth said Sir Francis bowing to her and
then to her mother Mrs Bannerworth and you Mr Holland I see have
been out enjoying the free breeze that plays over the hot fields It
must be refreshing

It is so sir said Charles I wish we could make you a partaker in
our walks

I wish you could with all my heart said Varney

Sir Francis said Flora must be a prisoner for some short time
longer yet

I ought not to consider it in any such light It is not imprisonment I
have taken sanctuary It is the well spring of life to me said Varney

I hope it may prove so but how do you find yourself this evening Sir
Francis Varney

Really it is difficult to say I fluctuate At times I feel as though
I should drop insensible on the earth and then I feel better than I
have done for some time previously

Doctor Chillingworth will be here bye and bye no doubt and he must
see what he can do for you to relieve you of these symptoms said
Flora

I am much beholden to you much beholden to you but I hope to be able
to do without the good doctor's aid in this instance though I must
admit I may appear ungrateful

Not at all not at all

Have you heard any news abroad to-day inquired Varney

None Sir Francis none there is nothing apparently stirring and now
go out when you would you would find nothing but what was old quiet
and familiar

We cannot wish to look upon anything with mere charms for a mind at
ease than we can see under such circumstances but I fear there are
some few old and familiar features that I should find sad havoc in

You would certainly for the burnings and razings to the ground of
some places have made some dismal appearances but time may efface
that and then the evil may die away and the future will become the
present should we be able to allay popular feeling

Yes said Sir Francis but popular prejudices or justice or
feeling are things not easily assuaged The people when once aroused go
on to commit all kinds of excess and there is no one point at which
they will step short of the complete extirpation of some one object or
other that they have taken a fancy to hunt

The hubbub and excitement must subside

The greater the ignorance the more persevering and the more brutal they
are said Sir Francis but I must not complain of what is the
necessary consequence of their state

It might be otherwise

So it might and no mischief arise either but as we cannot divert the
stream we may as well bend to the force of a current too strong to
resist

The moon is up said Flora who wished to turn the conversation from
that to another topic I see it yonder through the trees it rises red
and large it is very beautiful and yet there is not a cloud about to
give it the colour and appearance it now wears

Exactly so said Sir Francis Varney but the reason is the air is
filled with a light invisible vapour that has the effect you perceive
There has been much evaporation going on and now it shows itself in
giving the moon that peculiar large appearance and deep colour

Ay I see it peeps through the trees the branches of which cut it up
into various portions It is singular and yet beautiful and yet the
earth below seems dark

It is dark you would be surprised to find it so if you walked about
It will soon be lighter than it is at this present moment

What sounds are those inquired Sir Francis Varney as he listened
attentively

Sounds What sounds returned Henry

The sounds of wheels and horses feet said Varney

I cannot even hear them much less can I tell what they are said
Henry

Then listen Now they come along the road Cannot you hear them now
said Varney

Yes I can said Charles Holland but I really don't know what they
are or what it can matter to us we don't expect any visitors

Certainly certainly said Varney I am somewhat apprehensive of the
approach of strange sounds

You are not likely to be disturbed here said Charles

Indeed I thought so when I had succeeded in getting into the house
near the town and so far from believing it was likely I should be
discovered that I sat on the house-top while the mob surrounded it

Did you not hear them coming

I did

And yet you did not attempt to escape from them

No I could not persuade them I was not there save by my utter silence
I allowed them to come too close to leave myself time to
escape besides I could hardly persuade myself there could be any
necessity for so doing

It was fortunate it was as it happened afterwards that you were able
to reach the wood and get out of it unperceived by the mob

I should have been in an unfortunate condition had I been in their
hands long A man made of iron would not be able to resist the brutality
of those people

As they were speaking a gig with two men drove up followed by one on
horseback They stopped at the garden-gate and then tarried to consult
with each other as they looked at the house

What can they want I wonder inquired Henry I never saw them
before

Nor I said Charles Holland

Do you not know them at all inquired Varney

No replied Flora I never saw them neither can I imagine what is
their object in coming here

Did you ever see them before inquired Henry of his mother who held
up her hand to look more carefully at the strangers then shaking her
head she declared she had never seen such persons as those

I dare say not said Charles Holland They certainly are not
gentlemen but here they come there is some mistake I daresay they
don't want to come here

As they spoke the two strangers got down after picking up a topcoat
they had let fall they turned round and deliberately put it into the
chaise again they walked up the path to the door at which they
knocked

The door was opened by the old woman when the two men entered

Does Francis Beauchamp live here

Eh said the old woman who was a little deaf and she put her hand
behind her ear to catch the sounds more distinctly eh who did you
say

Sir Francis Varney started as the sounds came upon his ear but he sat
still an attentive listener

Are there any strangers in the house inquired the other officer
impatiently Who is here

Strangers said the old woman you are the only strangers that I have
seen here

Come said the officer to his companion come this way there are
people in this parlour Our business must be an apology for any rudeness
we may commit

As he spoke he stepped by the old woman and laying his hand upon the
handle of the door entered the apartment at the same time looking
carefully around the room as if he expected some one

Ladies said the stranger with an off-hand politeness that had
something repulsive in it though it was meant to convey a notion that
civility was intended ladies I beg pardon for intruding but I am
looking for a gentleman

You shall hear from me again soon said Sir Francis in an almost
imperceptible whisper

What is the object of this intrusion demanded Henry Bannerworth
rising and confronting the stranger This is a strange introduction

Yes but not an unusual one said the stranger in these cases being
unavoidable at the least

Sir said Charles Holland if you cannot explain quickly your
business here we will proceed to take those measures which will at
least rid ourselves of your company

Softly sir I mean no offence not the least but I tell you I do not
come for any purpose that is at all consonant to my wishes I am a
Bow-street officer in the execution of my duty excuse me therefore

Whom do you want

Francis Beauchamp and from the peculiarity of the appearance of this
individual here I think I may safely request the pleasure of his
company

Varney now rose and the officer made a rush at him when he saw him do
so saying 

Surrender in the king's name

Varney however paid no attention to that but rushed past throwing
his chair down to impede the officer who could not stay himself but
fell over it while Varney made a rush towards the window which he
cleared at one bound and crossing the road was lost to sight in a few
seconds in the trees and hedges on the other side

Accidents will happen said the officer as he rose to his feet I
did not think the fellow would have taken the window in that manner but
we have him in view and that will be enough

In heaven's name said Henry explain all about this we cannot
understand one word of it I am at a loss to understand one word of it

We will return and do so presently said the officer as he dashed out
of the house after the fugitive at a rapid and reckless speed followed
by his companion

The man who had been left with the chaise however was the first in the
chase seeing an escape from the window he immediately guessed that he
was the man wanted and but for an accident he would have met Varney
at the gate for as he was getting out in a hurry his foot became
entangled with the reins and he fell to the ground and Varney at the
same moment stepped over him

Curse his infernal impudence and d n these reins muttered the man
in a fury at the accident and the aggravating circumstance of the
fugitive walking over him in such a manner and so coolly too it was
vexing

The man however quickly released himself and rushed after Varney
across the road and kept on his track for some time The moon was still
rising and shed but a gloomy light around Everything was almost
invisible until you came close to it This was the reason why Varney and
his pursuer met with several severe accidents fumbles and hard knocks
against impediments which the light and the rapid flight they were
taking did not admit of their avoiding very well

They went on for some time but it was evident Varney knew the place
best and could avoid what the man could not and that was the trees and
the natural impediments of the ground which Varney was acquainted with

For instance at full speed across a meadow a hollow would suddenly
present itself and to an accustomed eye the moonlight might enable it
to be distinguished at a glance what it was while to one wholly
unaccustomed to it the hollow would often look like a hillock by such a
light This Varney would clear at a bound which a less agile and
heavier person would step into lifting up his leg to meet an
impediment when he would find it come down suddenly some six or eight
inches lower than he anticipated almost dislocating his leg and neck
and producing a corresponding loss of breath which was not regained by
the muttered curse upon such a country where the places were so uneven

Having come to one of these places which was a little more perceptible
than the others he made a desperate jump but he jumped into the middle
of the hole with such force that he sprained his ankle besides sinking
into a small pond that was almost dry being overgrown with rushes and
aquatic plants

Well said the other officer coming up well

Well indeed said the one who came first it's anything but well
D n all country excursions say I

Why Bob you don't mean to say as how you are caught in a rat-trap

Oh you be d  d I am ain't I

Yes but are you going to stop there or coming out eh You'll catch
cold

I have sprained my ankle

Well

It ain't well I tell you here have I a sprained foot and my wind
broken for a month at least Why were you not quicker If you had been
sharper we should have had the gentleman I'll swear

I tumbled down over the chair and he got out of the window and I come
out of the door

Well I got entangled in the reins but I got off after him only his
long legs carried him over everything I tell you what Wilkinson if I
were to be born again and intended to be a runner I would bespeak a
pair of long legs

Why

Because I should be able to get along better You have no idea of how
he skimmed along the ground it was quite beautiful only it wasn't good
to follow it

A regular sky scraper

Yes or something of that sort he looked like a patent flying shadow

Well get up and lead the way we'll follow you

I dare say you will when I lead the way back there for as to going
out yonder it is quite out of the question I want supper to-night and
breakfast to-morrow morning

Well what has that to do with it

Just this much if you follow any farther you'll get into the woods
and there you'll be going round and round like a squirrel in a cage
without being able to get out and you will there get none of the good
things included under the head of those meals

I think so too said the third

Well then let's go back we needn't run though it might be as well
to do so

It would be anything but well I don't gallop back depend upon it

The three men now slowly returned from their useless chase and re-trod
the way they had passed once in such a hurry that they could hardly
recognize it

What a dreadful bump I came against that pole standing there said
one

Yes and I came against a hedge-stake that was placed so as the moon
didn't show any light on it It came into the pit of my stomach I never
recollect such a pain in my life for all the world like a hot coal
being suddenly and forcibly intruded into your stomach

Well here's the road I must go up to the house where I started him
from I promised them some explanation I may as well go and give it to
them at once

Do as you will I will wait with the horse else perhaps that
Beauchamp will again return and steal him

The officer who had first entered the house now returned to the
Bannerworths saying

I promised you I would give you some explanation as to what you have
witnessed

Yes said Henry we have been awaiting your return with some anxiety
and curiosity What is the meaning of all this I am as we are all in
perfect ignorance of the meaning of what took place

I will tell you The person whom you have had here and goes by the
name of Varney is named Francis Beauchamp

Indeed Are you assured of this

Yes perfectly assured of it I have it in my warrant to apprehend him
by either name

What crime had he been guilty of

I will tell you he has been hanged

Hanged exclaimed all present

What do you mean by that added Henry I am at a loss to understand
what you can mean by saying he was hanged

What I say is literally true

Pray tell us all about it We are much interested in the fact go on
sir

Well sir then I believe it was for murder that Francis Beauchamp was
hanged yes hanged a common execution before a multitude of people
collected to witness such an exhibition

Good God exclaimed Henry Bannerworth And was but that is
impossible A dead man come to life again You must be amusing yourself
at our expense

Not I replied the officer Here is my warrant they don't make these
out in a joke

And as he spoke he produced the warrant when it was evident the
officer spoke the truth

How was this

I will tell you sir You see that this Varney was a regular scamp
gamester rogue and murderer He was hanged and hung about the usual
time he was cut down and the body was given to some one for dissection
when a surgeon with the hangman one Montgomery succeeded in restoring
the criminal to life

But I always thought they broke the neck when they were hanged the
weight of the body would alone do that

Oh dear no sir said the officer that is one of the common every
day mistakes they don't break the neck once in twenty times

Indeed

No they die of suffocation only this man Beauchamp was hanged thus
but they contrived to restore him and then he assumed a new name and
left London

But how came you to know all this

Oh it came to us as many things usually do in a very extraordinary
manner and in a manner that appears most singular and out of the way
but such it was

The executioner who was the means of his being restored or one of
them wished to turn him to account and used to draw a yearly sum of
money from him as hush money to induce them to keep the secret else
the fact of his having escaped punishment would subject him to a
repetition of the same punishment when of course a little more care
would be taken that he did not escape a second time

I dare say not

Well you see Varney or rather Beauchamp was to pay a heavy sum to
this man to keep him quiet and to permit him to enjoy the life he had
so strangely become possessed of

I see said Holland

Well this man Montgomery had always some kind of suspicion that
Varney would murder him

Murder him and be the means of saving his life surely he could not be
so bad as that

Why you see sir this hangman drew a heavy sum yearly from him thus
making him only a mine of wealth to himself this no doubt would
rankle in the other's heart to think he should be so beset and hold
life upon such terms

I see now

Yes and then came the consideration that he did not do it from any
good motive merely a selfish one and he was consequently under no
obligation to him for what he had done besides self-preservation might
urge him on and tell him to do the deed

However that may be Montgomery dreaded it and was resolved to punish
the deed if he could not prevent it He therefore left general orders
with his wife whenever he went on a journey to Varney if he should be
gone beyond a certain time she was to open a certain drawer and take
out a sealed packet to the magistrate at the chief office who would
attend to it

He has been missing and his wife did as she was desired and now we
have found what he there mentioned to be true but now sir I have
satisfied you and explained to you why we intruded upon you we must now
leave and seek for him elsewhere

It is most extraordinary and that is the reason why his complexion is
so singular

Very likely

They poured out some wine which was handed to the officers who drank
and then quitted the house leaving the inmates in a state of
stupefaction from surprise and amazement at what they had heard from
the officers

There was a strange feeling came over them when they recollected the
many occurrences they had witnessed and even the explanation of the
officers it seemed as if some mist had enveloped objects and rendered
them indistinct but which was fast rising and they were becoming
plainer and more distinct every moment in which they were regarded

There was a long pause and Flora was about to speak when suddenly
there came the sound of a footstep across the garden It was slow but
unsteady and paused between whiles until it came close beneath the
windows They remained silent and then some one was heard to climb up
the rails of the veranda and then the curtains were thrust aside but
not till after the person outside had paused to ascertain who was there

Then the curtains were opened and the visage of Sir Francis Varney
appeared much altered in fact completely worn and exhausted

It was useless to deny it but he looked ghastly terrific his singular
visage was as pallid as death his eyes almost protruding his mouth
opened and his breathing short and laboured in the extreme

He climbed over with much difficulty and staggered into the room and
would have spoken but he could not befell senseless upon the floor
utterly exhausted and motionless

There was a long pause and each one present looked at each other and
then they gazed upon the inanimate body of Sir Francis Varney which lay
supine and senseless in the middle of the floor

   

The importance of the document said to be on the dead body was such
that it would admit of no delay before it was obtained and the party
determined that it should be commenced instanter Lost time would be an
object to them too much haste could hardly be made and now came the
question of should it be to-night or not

Certainly said Henry Bannerworth the sooner we can get it the
sooner all doubt and distress will be at an end and considering the
turn of events that will be desirable for all our sakes besides we
know not what unlucky accident may happen to deprive us of what is so
necessary

There can be none said Mr Chillingworth but there is this to be
said this has been such an eventful history that I cannot say what
might or what might not happen

We may as well go this very night said Charles Holland I give my
vote for an immediate exhumation of the body The night is somewhat
stormy but nothing more the moon is up and there will be plenty of
light

And rain said the doctor

Little or none said Charles Holland A few gusts of wind now and
then drive a few heavy plashes of rain against the windows and that
gives a fearful sound which is in fret nothing when you have to
encounter it but you will go doctor

Yes most certainly We must have some tools

Those may be had from the garden said Henry Tools for the
exhumation you mean

Yes pickaxe mattocks and a crowbar a lantern and so forth said
the doctor You see I am at home in this the fact is I have had more
than one affair of this kind on my hands before now and whilst a
student I have had more than one adventure of a strange character

I dare say doctor said Charles Holland you have some sad pranks to
answer for you don't think of it then only when you find them
accumulated in a heap so that you shall not be able to escape them
because they come over your senses when you sleep at night

No no said Chillingworth you are mistaken in that I have long
since settled all my accounts of that nature besides I never took a
dead body out of a grave but in the name of science and never for my
own profit seeing I never sold one in my life or got anything by it

That is not the fact said Henry you know doctor you improved your
own talents and knowledge

Yes yes I did

Well but you profited by such improvements

Well granted I did How much more did the public not benefit then
said the doctor with a smile

Ah well we won't argue the question said Charles only it strikes
me that the doctor could never have been a doctor if he had not
determined upon following a profession

There may be a little truth in that said Chillingworth but now we
had better quit the house and make the best of our way to the spot
where the unfortunate man lies buried in his unhallowed grave

Come with me into the garden said Henry Bannerworth we shall there
be able to suit ourselves to what is required I have a couple of
lanterns

One is enough said Chillingworth we had better not burden ourselves
more than we are obliged to do and we shall find enough to do with the
tools

Yes they are not light and the distance is by far too great to make
walking agreeable and easy the wind blows strong and the rain appears
to be coming up afresh and by the time we have done we shall find the
ground will become slippy and bad for walking

Can we have a conveyance

No no said the doctor we could but we must trouble the turnpike
man besides there is a shorter way across some fields which will be
better and safer

Well well said Charles Holland I do not mind which way it is as
long as you are satisfied yourselves The horse and cart would have
settled it all better and done it quicker besides carrying the tools

Very true very true said the doctor all that is not without its
weight and you shall choose which way you would have it done for my
part I am persuaded the expedition on foot is to be preferred for two
reasons

And what are they

The first is we cannot obtain a horse and cart without giving some
detail as to what you want it for which is awkward on account of the
hour Moreover you could not get one at this moment in time

That ought to settle the argument said Henry Bannerworth an
impossibility under the circumstances at once is a clincher and one
that may be allowed to have some weight

You may say that said Charles

Besides which you must go a greater distance and that too along the
main road which is objectionable

Then we are agreed said Charles Holland and the sooner we are off
the better the night grows more and more gloomy every hour and more
inclement

It will serve our purpose the better said Chillingworth What we do
we may as well do now

Come with me to the garden said Henry and we will take the tools
We can go out the back way that will preclude any observation being
made

They all now left the apartment wrapped up in great overcoats to
secure themselves against the weather and also for the purpose of
concealing themselves from any chance passenger

In the garden they found the tools they required and having chosen
them they took a lantern with the mean of getting a light when they
got to their journey's end which they would do in less than an hour

After having duly inspected the state of their efficiency they started
away on their expedition

The night had turned gloomy and windy heavy driving masses of clouds
obscured the moon which only now and then was to be seen when the
clouds permitted her to peep out At the same time there were many
drifting showers which lasted but a few minutes and then the clouds
were carried forwards by some sudden gust of wind so that altogether
it was a most uncomfortable night as well could be imagined

However there was no time to lose and under all circumstances they
could not have chosen a better night for their purpose than the one they
had indeed they could not desire another night to be out on such a
purpose

They spoke not while they were within sight of the houses though at the
distance of many yards and at the same time there was a noise through
the trees that would have carried their voices past every object
however close but they would make assurance doubly sure

I think we are fairly away now said Henry from all fear of being
recognized

To be sure you are Who would recognize us now if we were met

No one

I should think not and moreover there would be but small chance of
any evil coming from it even if it were to happen that we were to be
seen and known Nobody knows what we are going to do and if they did
there is no illegality in the question

Certainly not but we wish the matter to be quite secret therefore we
don't wish to be seen by any one while upon this adventure

Exactly said Chillingworth and if you'll follow my guidance you
shall meet nobody

We will trust you most worthy doctor What have you to say for our
confidence

That you will find it is not misplaced

Just as the doctor had uttered the last sound there came a hearty laugh
upon the air which indeed sounded but a few paces in advance of them
The wind blew towards them and would therefore cause the sounds to
come to them but not to go away in the direction they were going

The whole party came to a sudden stand still there was something so
strange in hearing a laugh at that moment especially as Chillingworth
was at that moment boasting of his knowledge of the ground and the
certainty of their meeting no one

What is that inquired Henry

Some one laughing I think said Chillingworth

Of that there can be little or no doubt said Charles Holland and
as people do not usually laugh by themselves so heartily it may be
presumed there are at least two

No doubt of it

And moreover their purpose cannot be a very good one at this hour of
the night and of such a night too I think we had better be cautious

Hush Follow me silently said Henry

As he spoke he moved cautiously from the spot where he stood and at
the same time he was followed by the whole party until they came to
the hedge which skirted a lane in which were seated three men

They had a sort of tent erected and that was hung upon a part of the
hedge which was to windward of them so that it sheltered them from wind
and rain

Henry and Chillingworth both peeped over the bank and saw them seated
beneath this kind of canopy They were shabby gipsy-looking men who
might be something else sheep-stealers or horse-stealers in fact
anything even to beggars

I say Jack said one it's no bottle to-night

No there's nobody about these parts to-night We are safe and so are
they

Exactly

Besides you see those who do happen to be out are not worth talking
to

No cash

None not enough to pay turnpike for a walking-slick at the most

Besides it does us no good to take a few shillings from a poor wretch
who has more in family than he has shillings in pocket

Ay you are right quite right I don't like it myself I don't
besides that there's fresh risk in every man you stop and these poor
fellows will fight hard for a few shillings and there is no knowing
what an unlucky blow may do for a man

That is very true Has anything been done to-night

Nothing said one

Only three half crowns said the other that is the extent of the
common purse to-night

And I said the third I have got a bottle of bad gin from the Cat
and Cabbage-stump

How did you manage it

Why this way I went in and had some beer and you know I can give a
long yarn when I want but it wants only a little care to deceive these
knowing countrymen so I talked and talked until they got quite chatty
and then I put the gin in my pocket

Good

Well then the loaf and beef I took out of the safe as I came by and
I dare say they know they have lost it by this time

Yes and so do we I expect the gin will help to digest the beef so we
mustn't complain of the goods

No give us another glass Jim

Jim held the glass towards him when the doctor animated by the spirit
of mischief took a good sized pebble and threw it into the glass
smashing it and spilling the contents

In a moment there was a change of scene the men were all terrified and
started to their feet while a sudden gust of wind caused their light to
go out at the same time their tent-cloth was thrown down by the wind
and fell across their heads

Come along said the doctor

There was no need of saying so for in a moment the three were as if
animated by one spirit and away they scudded across the fields with
the speed of a race horse

In a few minutes they were better than half a mile away from the spot

In absence of all authentic information said the doctor speaking as
well as he could and blowing prodigiously between each word as though
he were fetching breath all the way from his heels I think we may
conclude we are safe from them We ought to thank our stars we came
across them in the way we did

But doctor what in the name of Heaven induced you to make such a
noise to frighten them in fact and to tell them some one was about

They were too much terrified to tell whether it was one or fifty By
this time they are out of the county they knew what they were talking
about

And perhaps we may meet them on the road where we are going thinking
it a rare lonely spot where they can hide and no chance of their being
found out

Illustration

No said the doctor they will not go to such a place it has by far
too bad a name for even such men as those to go near much less stop
in

I can hardly think that said Charles Holland for these fellows are
too terrified for their personal safety to think of the superstitious
fears with which a place may be regarded and these men in such a place
as the one you speak of they will be at home

Well well rather than be done we must fight for it and when you
come to consider we have one pick and two shovels we shall be in full
force

Well said doctor how far have we to go

Not more than a quarter of a mile

They pursued their way through the fields and under the hedge-rows
until they came to a gate where they stopped awhile and began to
consult and to listen

A few yards up here on the left said the doctor I know the spot
besides there is a particular mark Now then are you all ready

Yes all

Here said the doctor pointing out the marks by which the spot might
be recognized here is the spot and I think we shall not be half a
foot out of our reckoning

Then let us begin instanter said Henry as he seized hold of the
pickaxe and began to loosen the earth by means of the sharp end

That will do for the present said Chillingworth now let me and
Charles take a turn with our shovels and you will get on again
presently Throw the earth up on the bank in one heap so that we can
put it on again without attracting any attention to the spot by its
being left in clods and uneven

Exactly said Henry else the body will be discovered

They began to shovel away and continued to do so after it had been
picked up working alternately until at length Charles stuck his
pick-axe into something soft and upon pulling it up he found it was
the body

A dreadful odour now arose from the spot and they were at no loss to
tell where the body lay The pick-axe had stuck into the deceased's ribs
and clothing and thus lifted it out of its place

Here it is said the doctor but I needn't tell you that the
charnel-house smell is enough to convince you of the fact of where it
is

I think so just show a light upon the subject doctor and then we can
see what we are about do you mind doctor you have the management of
the lantern you know

Yes yes said Chillingworth I see you have it don't be in a hurry
but do things deliberately and coolly whatever you do you will not be
so liable to make mistakes or to leave anything undone

There will be nothing of any use to you here doctor in the way of
dissection for the flesh is one mass of decay What a horrible sight
to be sure

It is but hasten the search

Well I must though to confess the truth I'd sooner handle anything
than this

It is not the most pleasant thing in the world for there is no knowing
what may be the result what creeping thing has made a home of it

Don't mention anything about it

Henry and Charles Holland now began to search the pockets of the clothes
of the dead body in one of which was something hard that felt like a
parcel

What have you got there said Chillingworth as he held his lantern up
so that the light fell upon the ghastly object that they were handling

I think it is the prize said Charles Holland but we have not got it
out yet though I dare say it won't be long first if this wind will but
hold good for about five minutes and keep the stench down

They now tore open the packet and pulled out the papers which appeared
to have been secreted upon his person

Be sure there are none on any other part of the body said
Chillingworth because what you do now you had better do well and
leave nothing to after thought because it is frequently impracticable

The advice is good said Henry who made a second search but found
nothing

We had better re-bury him said the doctor it had better be done
cleanly Well it is a sad hole for a last resting-place and yet I do
not know that it matters it is all a matter of taste the fashion of
the class or the particular custom of the country

There was but little to be said against such an argument though the
custom of the age had caused them to look upon it more as a matter of
feeling than in such a philosophical sense as that in which the doctor
had put it

Well there he is now shovel the earth in Charles said Henry
Bannerworth as he himself set the example which was speedily and
vigorously followed by Charles Holland when they were not long before
the earth was thrown in and covered up with care and trodden down so
that it should not appear to be moved

This will do I think said Henry

Yes it is not quite the same but I dare say no one will try to make
any discoveries in this place besides if the rain continues to come
down very heavy why it will wash much of it away and it will make it
look all alike

There was little inducement to hover about the spot but Henry could not
forbear holding up the papers to the light of the lantern to ascertain
what they were

Are they all right inquired the doctor

Yes replied Henry yes The Dearbrook estate Oh yes they are the
papers I am in want of

It is singularly fortunate at least to be successful in securing
them I am very glad a living person has possession of them else it
would have been very difficult to have obtained it from them

So it would but now homeward is the word doctor and on my word there
is reason to be glad for the rain is coming on very fast now and there
is no moon at all we had better step out

They did for the three walked as fast as the nature of the soil would
permit them and the darkness of the night




 LXXXIX

TELLS WHAT BECAME OF THE SECOND vampire WHO SOUGHT VARNEY


Illustration

We left the Hungarian nobleman swimming down the stream he swam slowly
and used but little exertion in doing so He appeared to use his hands
only as a means of assistance

The stream carried him onwards and he aided himself so far that he kept
the middle of the stream and floated along

Where the stream was broad and shallow it sometimes left him a moment
or two without being strong enough to carry him onwards then he would
pause as if gaining strength and finally he would when he had rested
and the water came a little faster and lifted him make a desperate
plunge and swim forward until he again came in deep water and then he
went slowly along with the stream as he supported himself

It was strange thus to see a man going down slowly and without any
effort whatever passing through shade and through moonlight now lost
in the shadow of the tall trees and now emerging into that part of the
stream which ran through meadows and cornfields until the stream
widened and then at length a ferry-house was to be seen in the
distance

Then came the ferryman out of his hut to look upon the beautiful
moonlight scene It was cold but pure and brilliantly light The
chaste moon was sailing through the heavens and the stars diminished in
their lustre by the power of the luminous goddess of night

There was a small cottage true it was somewhat larger than was
generally supposed by any casual observer who might look at it The
place was rambling and built chiefly of wood but in it lived the
ferryman his wife and family among these was a young girl about
seventeen years of age but at the same time very beautiful

They had been preparing their supper and the ferryman himself walked
out to look at the river and the shadows of the tall trees that stood on
the hill opposite

While thus employed he heard a plashing in the water and on turning
towards the quarter whence the sound proceeded for a few yards he came
to the spot where he saw the stranger struggling in the stream

Good God he muttered to himself as he saw the struggle continued
good God he will sink and drown

As he spoke he jumped into his boat and pushed it off for the purpose
of stopping the descent of the body down the stream and in a moment or
two it came near to him He muttered 

Come come he tries to swim life is not gone yet he will do now if
I can catch hold of him Swimming with one's face under the stream
doesn't say much for his skill though it may account for the fact that
he don't cry out

As the drowning man neared the ferryman held on by the boat-hook and
stooping down he seized the drowning man by the hair of the head and
then paused

After a time he lifted him up and placed him across the edge of the
boat and then with some struggling of his own he was rolled over into
the boat

You are safe now muttered the ferryman

The stranger spoke not but sat or leaned against the boat's head
sobbing and catching at his breath and spitting off his stomach the
water it might be presumed he had swallowed

The ferryman put back to the shore when he paused and secured his
boat and then pulled the stranger out saying 

Do you feel any better now

Yes said the stranger I feel I am living thanks to you my good
friend I owe you my life

You are welcome to that replied the ferryman it costs me nothing
and as for my little trouble I should be sorry to think of that when
a fellow-being's life was in danger

You have behaved very well very well and I can do little more now
than thank you for I have been robbed of all I possessed about me at
the moment

Oh you have been robbed

Aye truly I have and have been thrown into the water and thus I
have been nearly murdered

It is lucky you escaped from them without further injury said the
ferryman but come in doors you must be mad to stand here in the
cold

Thank you your hospitality is great and at this moment of the
greatest importance to me

Such as we have said the honest ferryman you shall be welcome to
Come in come in

He turned round and led the way to the house which he entered
saying as he opened the small door that led into the main apartment
where all the family were assembled waiting for the almost only meal
they had had that day for the ferryman had not the means before the
sun had set of sending for food and then it was a long way before it
could be found and then it was late before they could get it 

Wife we have a stranger to sleep with us to-night and for whom we
must prepare a bed

A stranger echoed the wife a stranger and we so poor

Yes one whose life I have saved and who was nearly drowned We cannot
refuse hospitality upon such an occasion as that you know wife

The wife looked at the stranger as he entered the room and sat down by
the fire

I am sorry he said to intrude upon you but I will make you amends
for the interruption and inconvenience I may cause you but it is too
late to apply elsewhere and yet I am doubtful if there were whether I
could go any further

No no said the ferryman I am sure a man who has been beaten and
robbed and thrown into a rapid and in some parts deep stream is not
fit to travel at this time of night

You are lonely about here said the stranger as he shivered by the
fire

Yes rather but we are used to it

You have a family too that must help to lighten the hours away and
help you over the long evenings

So you may think stranger and at times so it is but when food runs
short it is a long while to daylight before any more money can be had
To be sure we have fish in the river and we have what we can grow in
the garden but these are not all the wants that we feel and those
others are sometimes pinching However we are thankful for what we
have and complain but little when we can get no more but sometimes we
do repine though I cannot say we ought but I am merely relating the
fact whether it be right or wrong

Exactly How old is your daughter

She is seventeen come Allhallow's eve

That is not far hence said the stranger I hope I may be in this
part of the country and I think I shall I will on that eve pay you a
visit not one on which I shall be a burden to you but one more useful
to you and more consonant to my character

The future will tell us all about that said the ferryman at present
we will see what we can do without complaining or taxing anybody

The stranger and the ferryman sat conversing for some time before the
fire and then the latter pointed out to him which was his bed one made
up near the fire for the sake of its warmth and then the ferryman
retired to the next room a place which was merely divided by an
imperfect partition

However they all fell soundly asleep The hours on that day had been
longer than usual there was not that buoyancy of spirit when they
retired they fell off into a heavy deep slumber

From this they were suddenly aroused by loud cries and piercing screams
from one of the family

So loud and shrill were the cries that they all started up terrified
and bewildered beyond measure unable to apply their faculties to any
one object

Help help father help shrieked the voice of the young girl whom
we have before noticed

The ferryman jumped up and rushed to the spot where his daughter lay

Fanny he said Fanny what ails thee what ails thee Tell me my
dear child

Oh she exclaimed almost choked oh father are we all alone I am
terrified

What ails thee what ails thee Tell me what caused you to scream out
in such a manner

I I that is I father thought but no I am sure it was reality
Where is the stranger

A light a light shouted the fisherman

In another moment a light was brought him and he discovered the
stranger reclining in his bed but awake and looking around him as if
in the utmost amazement

What has happened he said what has happened

That is more than I know as yet the man replied Come Fanny he
added tell me what it is you fear What caused you to scream out in
that dreadful manner

Oh father the vampire

Great God what do you mean Fanny by that

I hardly know father I was fast asleep when I thought I felt
something at my throat but being very sound asleep I did not
immediately awake Presently I felt the sharp pang of teeth being driven
into the flesh of my neck I awoke and found the vampire at his repast
Oh God oh God what shall I do

Stay my child let us examine the wound said the fisherman and he
held the candle to the spot where the vampire's teeth had been applied
There sure enough were teeth marks such as a human being's would make
were they applied but no blood had been drawn therefrom

Come come Fanny so far by divine Providence you are not injured
another moment and the mischief would have been done entire and
complete and you would have been his victim

Then turning to the stranger he said 

You have had some hand in this No human being but you could come into
this place The cottage door is secured You must be the vampire

I

Yes who else could

I As Heaven's my judge but there it's useless to speak of it I
have not been out of my bed In this place dark as it is and less used
to darkness than you I could not even find my way about It is
impossible

Get out of your bed and let me feel said the ferryman
peremptorily get out and I will soon tell

The stranger arose and began to dress himself and the ferryman
immediately felt the bed on which he had been lying but it was ice
cold so cold that he started upon his legs in an instant exclaiming
with vehemence 

It is you vile wretch that has attempted to steal into the cottage of
the poor man and then to rob him of his only child and that child of
her heart's blood base ingrate

My friend you are wrong entirely wrong I am not the creature you
believe me I have slept and slept soundly and awoke not until your
daughter screamed

Scoundrel liar base wretch you shall not remain alive to injure
those who have but one life to lose

As he spoke the ferryman made a desperate rush at the vampire and
seized him by the throat and a violent struggle ensued in which the
superior strength of the ferryman prevailed and he brought his
antagonist to the earth at the same time bestowing upon him some
desperate blows

Thou shall go to the same element from which I took thee said the
ferryman and there swim or sink as thou wilt until some one shall drag
thee ashore and when they do may they have a better return than I

As he spoke he dragged along the stranger by main force until they came
to the bank of the river and then pausing to observe the deepest part
he said 

Here then you shall go

The vampire struggled and endeavoured to speak but he could not the
grasp at his throat prevented all attempts at speech and then with a
sudden exertion of his strength the ferryman lifted the stranger up
and heaved him some distance into the river

Then in deep water sank the body

The ferryman watched for some moments and farther down the stream he
saw the body again rise upon the current and struggling slightly as for
life now whirled around and around and then carried forward with the
utmost velocity

This continued as far as the moonlight enabled the ferryman to see and
then with a slow step and clouded brow he returned to his cottage
which he entered and closed the door

DR CHILLINGWORTH AT THE HALL THE ENCOUNTER OF MYSTERY THE
CONFLICT THE RESCUE AND THE PICTURE


Illustration

There have been many events that have passed rapidly in this our
narrative but more have yet to come before we can arrive at that point
which will clear up much that appears to be most mysterious and
unaccountable

Doctor Chillingworth but ill satisfied with the events that had yet
taken place determined once more upon visiting the Hall and there to
attempt a discovery of something respecting the mysterious apartment in
which so much has already taken place

He communicated his design to no one he resolved to prosecute the
inquiry alone He determined to go there and await whatever might turn
up in the shape of events He would not for once take any companion
such adventures were often best prosecuted alone they were most easily
brought to something like an explanatory position one person can often
consider matters more coolly than more At all events there is more
secrecy than under any other circumstances

Perhaps this often is of greater consequence than many others and
moreover when there is more than one something is usually overdone
Where one adventurous individual will rather draw back in a pursuit
more than one would induce them to urge each other on

In fact one in such a case could act the part of a spy a secret
observer and in that case can catch people at times when they could not
under any other circumstances be caught or observed at all

I will go he muttered and should I be compelled to run away again
why nobody knows anything about it and nobody will laugh at me

This was all very well but Mr Chillingworth was not the man to run
away without sufficient cause But there was so much mystery in all this
that he felt much interested in the issue of the affair But this issue
he could not command at the same time he was determined to sit and
watch and thus become certain that either something or nothing was to
take place

Even the knowledge of that much that some inexplicable action was still
going on was far preferable to the uncertainty of not knowing whether
what had once been going on was still so or not because if it had
ceased it was probable that nothing more would ever be known concerning
it and the mystery would still be a mystery to the end of time

It shall be fathomed if there be any possibility of its being
discovered muttered Chillingworth Who would have thought that so
quiet and orderly a spot as this our quiet village would have suffered
so much commotion and disturbance Far from every cause of noise and
strife it is quite as great a matter of mystery as the vampire business
itself

I have been so mixed up in this business that I must go through with
it By the way of the mysteries the greatest that I have met with is
the fact of the vampire having anything to do with so quiet a family as
the Bannerworths

Mr Chillingworth pondered over the thought but yet he could make
nothing of it It in no way tended to elucidate anything connected with
the affair and it was much too strange and singular in all its parts to
be submitted to any process of thought with any hope of coming to
anything like a conclusion upon the subject that must remain until some
facts were ascertained and to obtain them Mr Chillingworth now
determined to try

This was precisely what was most desirable in the present state of
affairs while things remained in the present state of uncertainty
there would be much more of mystery than could ever be brought to light

One or two circumstances cleared up the minor ones would follow in the
same train and they would be explained by the others and if ever that
happy state of things were to come about why then there would be a
perfect calm in the town

As Mr Chillingworth was going along he thought he observed two men
sitting inside a hedge close to a hay-rick and thinking neither of
them had any business there he determined to listen to their
conversation and ascertain if it had any evil tendency or whether it
concerned the late event

Having approached near the gate and they being on the other side he
got over without any noise and unperceived by either of them crept
close up to them

So you haven't long come from sea

No I have just landed

How is it you have thrown aside your seaman's clothes and taken to
these

Just to escape being found out

Found out what do you mean by that Have you been up to anything

Yes I have Jack I have been up to something worse luck to me but
I'm not to be blamed either

What is it all about inquired his companion I always thought you
were such a steady-going old file that there was no going out of the
even path with you

Nor would there have been but for one simple circumstance

What was that

I will tell you Jack I will tell you you will never betray me I am
sure

Never by heavens

Well then listen it was this I had been some time aboard our
vessel I had sailed before but the captain never showed any signs of
being a bad man and I was willing enough to sail with him again

He knew I was engaged to a young woman in this country and that I was
willing to work hard to save money to make up a comfortable home for us
both and that I would not sail again but that I intended to remain
ashore and make up my mind to a shore life

Well you would have a house then

Exactly and that's what I wished to do Well I made a small venture
in the cargo and thought by so doing that I should have a chance of
realizing a sum of money that would put us both in a comfortable line of
business

Well we went on very smoothly until we were coming back We had
disposed of the cargo and I had received some money and this seemed to
cause our captain to hate me because I had been successful but I
thought there was something else in it than that but I could not tell
what it was that made him so intolerably cross and tyrannous

Well I found out at length he knew my intended wife He knew her
very well and at the same time he made every effort he could to induce
me to commit some act of disobedience and insubordination but I would
not for it seemed to me he was trying all he could to prevent my doing
my duty with anything like comfort

However I learned the cause of all this afterwards It was told me by
one of the crew

'Bill said my mate look out for yourself'

'What's in the wind said I

'Only the captain has made a dead set at you and you'll be a lucky man
if you escape'

'What's it all about said I I cannot understand what he means I
have done nothing wrong I don't see why I should suddenly be treated in
this way'

'It's all about your girl Bill'

'Indeed said I What can that have to do with the captain he knows
nothing of her'

'Oh yes he does he said If it were not for you he would have the
girl himself'

'I see now said I

'Ay and so can a blind man if you open his eyes but he wants to make
you do wrong to goad you on to do something that will give him the
power of disgracing you and perhaps of punishing you'

'He won't do that said I

'I am glad to hear you say so Bill for to my mind he has made up
his mind to go the whole length against you I can't make it out unless
he wishes you were dead'

'I dare say he does said I but I will take care I will live to
exact a reckoning when he comes ashore'

'That is the best and when we are paid off Bill if you will take it
out of him and pay him off why I don't care if I lend you a hand'

'We'll say more about that Dick said I when we get ashore and are
paid off If we are overheard now it will be said that we are
conspiring or committing mutiny or something of that sort'

'You are right Bill he said you are right We'll say no more about
this now but you may reckon upon me when we are no longer under his
orders'

'Then there's no danger you know'

Well we said nothing about this but I thought of it and I had cause
enough too to think of it for each day the captain grew more and more
tyrannous and brutal I knew not what to do but kept my resolution of
doing my duty in spite of all he could do though I don't mind admitting
I had more than one mind to kill him and myself afterwards

However I contrived to hold out for another week or two and then we
came into port and were released from his tyranny I got paid off and
then I met my messmate and we had some talk about the matter

'The worst of it is said I we shall have some difficulty to catch
him and if we can I'll be sworn we shall give him enough to last him
for at least a voyage or two'

'He ought to have it smart said my messmate and I know where he is
to be found'

'Do you at what hour'

'Late at night when he may be met with as he comes from a house where
he spends his evenings

'That will be the best time in the world when we shall have less
interference than at any other time in the day But we'll have a turn
to-night if you will be with me as he will be able to make too good a
defence to one It will be a fight and not a chastisement'

'It will I will be with you you know where to meet me I shall be at
the old spot at the usual time and then we will go'

We parted and in the evening we both went together and sought the
place where we should find him out and set upon him to advantage

He was nearly two hours before he came but when he did come we
saluted him with a rap on the head that made him hold his tongue and
then we set to and gave him such a tremendous drubbing that we left
him insensible but he was soon taken away by some watchmen and we
heard that he was doing well but he was dreadfully beaten indeed it
would take him some weeks before he could be about in his duties

He was fearfully enraged and offered fifty pounds reward to any one
who could give him information as to who it was that assaulted him

I believe he had a pretty good notion of who it was but he could not
swear to me but still seeing he was busying himself too much about me
I at once walked away and went on my way to another part of the
country

To get married

Ay and to get into business

Then things are not quite so bad as I thought for at first

No no not so bad but what they might have been worse a great deal
only I cannot go to sea any more that's quite certain

You needn't regret that

I don't know

Why not know Are you not going to be married ain't that much
better

I can't say replied the sailor there's no knowing how my bargain
may turn out if she does well why then the cruising is over but
nothing short of that will satisfy me for if my wife is at all not what
I wish her to be why I shall be off to sea

I don't blame you either I would do so too if it were possible but
you see we can't do so well on land as you do at sea we can be
followed about from pillar to post and no bounds set to our
persecution

That's true enough said the other we can cut and run when we have
had enough of it However I must get to the village as I shall sleep
there to-night if I find my quarters comfortable enough

Come on then at once said his companion it's getting dark now
and you have no time to lose

These two now got up and walked away towards the village and
Chillingworth arose also and pursued his way towards the Hall while he
remarked to himself 

Well well they have nothing to do with that affair at all events
By-the-bye I wonder what amount of females are deserted in the navy
they certainly have an advantage over landsmen in the respect of being
tied to tiresome partners they can at least for a season get a
release from their troubles and be free at sea

However Mr Chillingworth got to the Hall and unobserved for he had
been especially careful not to be seen he had watched on all sides and
no signs of a solitary human being had he seen that could in any way
make the slightest observation upon him

Indeed he had sheltered himself from observation at every point of his
road especially so when near Bannerworth Hall where there were plenty
of corners to enable him to do so and when he arrived there he entered
at the usual spot and then sat down a few moments in the bower

I will not sit here he muttered I will go and have a watch at that
mysterious picture there is the centre of attraction be it what it
may

As he spoke he arose and walked into the house and entered the same
apartment which has been so often mentioned to the reader

Here he took a chair and sat down full before the picture and began to
contemplate it

Well for a good likeness I cannot say I ever saw anything more
unprepossessing I am sure such a countenance as that could never have
won a female heart Surely it is more calculated to terrify the
imagination than to soothe the affections of the timid and shrinking
female

However I will have an inspection of the picture and see if I can
make anything of it

As he spoke he put his hand upon the picture with the intention of
removing it when it suddenly was thrust open and a man stepped down

The doctor was for a moment completely staggered it was so utterly
unexpected and he stepped back a pace or two in the first emotion of
his surprise but this soon passed by and he prepared to close with his
antagonist which he did without speaking a word

There was a fair struggle for more than two or three minutes during
which the doctor struggled and fought most manfully but it was evident
that Mr Chillingworth had met with a man who was his superior in point
of strength for he not only withstood the utmost force that
Chillingworth could bring against him but maintained himself and
turned his strength against the doctor

Chillingworth panted with exertion and found himself gradually losing
ground and was upon the point of being thrown down at the mercy of his
adversary who appeared to be inclined to take all advantages of him
when an occurrence happened that altered the state of affairs
altogether

While they were struggling the doctor borne partially to the earth but
yet struggling suddenly his antagonist released his hold and staggered
back a few paces

There you swab take that I am yard-arm and yard-arm with you you
piratical-looking craft you lubberly buccaneering son of a fish-fag

Before however Jack Pringle for it was he who came so opportunely to
the rescue of Doctor Chillingworth could find time to finish the
sentence he found himself assailed by the very man who but a minute
before he had as he thought placed hors de combat

Illustration

A desperate fight ensued and the stranger made the greatest efforts to
escape with the picture but found he could not get off without a
desperate struggle He was at length compelled to relinquish the hope
of carrying that off for both Mr Chillingworth and Jack Pringle were
engaged hand to hand but the stranger struck Jack so heavy a blow on
the head that made him reel a few yards and then he escaped through
the window leaving Jack and Mr Chillingworth masters of the field but
by no means unscathed by the conflict in which they had been engaged




 XCI

THE GRAND CONSULTATION BROKEN UP BY MRS CHILLINGWORTH AND THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF VARNEY


Illustration

Remarkable was the change that had taken place in the circumstances of
the Bannerworth family From a state of great despondency and indeed
absolute poverty they had suddenly risen to comfort and independence

It seemed as if the clouds that had obscured their destiny had now
with one accord dissipated and that a brighter day was dawning Not
only had the circumstances of mental terror which had surrounded them
given way in a great measure to the light of truth and reflection but
those pecuniary distresses which had pressed upon them for a time were
likewise passing away and it seemed probable that they would be in a
prosperous condition

The acquisition of the title deeds of the estate which they thought
had passed away from the family for ever became to them in their
present circumstances an immense acquisition and brought to their
minds a feeling of great contentment

Many persons in their situation would have been extremely satisfied at
having secured so strong an interest in the mind of the old admiral who
was very wealthy and who from what he had already said and done no
doubt fully intended to provide handsomely for the Bannerworth family

And not only had they this to look forward to if they had chosen to
regard it as an advantage but they knew that by the marriage of Flora
with Charles Holland she would have a fortune at her disposal while he
Charles would be the last man in the world to demur at any reasonable
amount of it being lavished upon her mother and her brothers

But all this did not suit the high and independent spirit of Henry
Bannerworth He was one who would rather have eaten the dust that he
procured for himself by some meritorious exertion than have feasted on
the most delicate viands placed before him from the resources of
another

But now that he knew this small estate the title deeds of which had
been so singularly obtained had once really belonged to the family but
had been risked and lost at the gaming-table he had no earthly scruple
in calling such property again his own

As to the large sum of money which Sir Francis Varney in his confessions
had declared to have found its way into the possession of Marmaduke
Bannerworth Henry did not expect and scarcely wished to become
possessed of wealth through so tainted a source

No he said to himself frequently no I care not if that wealth be
never forthcoming which was so badly got possession of Let it sink
into the earth if indeed it be buried there or let it rot in some
unknown corner of the old mansion I care not for it

In this view of the case he was not alone for a family more unselfish
or who cared so little for money could scarcely have been found but
Admiral Bell and Charles Holland argued now that they had a right to the
amount of money which Marmaduke Bannerworth had hidden somewhere and
the old admiral reasoned upon it rather ingeniously for he said 

I suppose you don't mean to dispute that the money belongs to somebody
and in that case I should like to know who else it belonged to if not
to you How do you get over that master Henry

I don't attempt to get over it at all said Henry all I say is that
I do dislike the whole circumstances connected with it and the manner
in which it was come by and now that we have a small independence I
hope it will not be found But admiral we are going to hold a family
consultation as to what we shall do and what is to become of Varney He
has convinced me of his relationship to our family and although his
conduct has certainly been extremely equivocal he has made all the
amends in his power and now as he is getting old I do not like to
throw him upon the wide world for a subsistence

You don't contemplate said the admiral letting him remain with you
do you

No that would be objectionable for a variety of reasons and I could
not think of it for a moment

I should think not The idea of sitting down to breakfast dinner tea
and supper with a vampire and taking your grog with a fellow that sucks
other people's blood

Really admiral you do not really still cling to the idea that Sir
Francis Varney is a vampire

I really don't know he clings to it himself that's all I can say and
I think under those circumstances I might as well give him the benefit
of his own proposition and suppose that he is a vampire

Really uncle said Charles Holland I did think that you had
discarded the notion

Did you I have been thinking of it and it ain't so desirable to be a
vampire I am sure that any one should pretend to it who is not
therefore I take the fellow upon his own showing He is a vampire in
his own opinion and so I don't see for the life of me why he should
not be so in ours

Well said Henry waving all that what are we to do with him
Circumstances seem to have thrown him completely at our mercy What are
we to do with him and what is to become of him for the future

I'll tell you what I'll do said the admiral If he were ten times a
vampire there is some good in the fellow and I will give him enough to
live upon if he will go to America and spend it They will take good
care there that he sucks no blood out of them for although an American
would always rather lose a drop of blood than a dollar they keep a
pretty sharp look out upon both

The proposal can be made to him said Henry at all events It is one
which I don't dislike and probably one that he would embrace at once
because he seems to me to have completely done with ambition and to
have abandoned those projects concerning which at one time he took
such a world of trouble

Don't you trust to that said the admiral What's bred in the bone
don't so easily get out of the flesh and once or twice when Master
Varney has been talking I have seen those odd looking eyes of his flash
up for a moment as if he were quite ready to begin his old capers
again and alarm the whole country side

I must confess said Charles Holland that I myself have had the
impression once or twice that Varney was only subdued for a time and
that with a proper amount of provocation he would become again a very
serious fellow and to the full as troublesome as he has been

Do you doubt his sincerity said Henry

No I do not do that Henry I think Varney fully means what he says
but I think at the same time that he has for so long lead a strange
wild and reckless life that he will find it very far from easy if
indeed possible to shake off his old habits and settle down quietly if
not to say comfortably

I regret said Henry that you have such an impression but while I
do so I cannot help admitting that it is to a considerable extent no
more than a reasonable one and perhaps after all my expectation that
Varney will give us no more trouble only amounts to a hope that he will
not do so and nothing more But let us consider there seems to be some
slight difference of opinion among us as to whether we should take up
our residence at this new house of ours which we did not know we owned
at Dearbrook or proceed to London and there establish ourselves or
again return to Bannerworth Hall and by a judicious expenditure of
some money make that a more habitable place than it has been for the
last twenty years

Now I'll tell you what said the admiral I would do It's quite out
of the question for any body to live long unless they see a ship don't
you think so Miss Flora

Why how can you ask Flora such a question uncle said Charles
Holland when you know she don't care a straw about ships and only
looks upon admirals as natural curiosities

Excepting one said Flora and he is an admiral who is natural but no
curiosity unless it be that you can call him such because he is so
just and generous and as for ships who can help admiring them and if
Admiral Bell proposes that we live in some pleasant marine villa by the
sea-coast he shall have my vote and interest for the proceeding

Bravo Huzza cried the admiral I tell you what it is Master
Charley you horse marine I have a great mind to cut you out and have
Miss Flora myself

Don't uncle said Charles that would be so very cruel after she
has promised me so faithfully How do you suppose I should like it come
now be merciful

At this moment and before any one could make another remark there came
rather a sharp ring at the garden-gate bell and Henry exclaimed 

That's Mr Chillingworth and I am glad he has come in time to join our
conference His advice is always valuable and moreover I rather think
he will bring us some news worth the hearing

The one servant who they had to wait upon them looked into the room and
said If you please here is Mrs Chillingworth

Mistress you mean Mr

No it is Mrs Chillingworth and her baby

The devil said the admiral what can she want

I'll come and let you know said Mrs Chillingworth what I want
and she darted into the room past the servant I'll soon let you know
you great sea crab I want my husband and what with your vampire and
one thing and another I haven't had him at home an hour for the past
three weeks What am I to do There is all his patients getting well as
fast as they can without him and when they find that out do you think
they will take any more filthy physic No to be sure not people ain't
such fools as to do anything of the sort

I'll tell you what we will do ma'am said the admiral we'll all get
ill at once on purpose to oblige ye and I'll begin by having the
measles

You are an old porpoise and I believe it all owing to you that my
husband neglects his wife and family What's vampires to him I should
like to know that he should go troubling about them I never heard of
vampires taking draughts and pills

No nor any body else that had the sense of a goose said the admiral
but if it's your husband you want ma'am it's no use your looking for
him here for here he is not

Then where is he He is running after some of your beastly vampires
somewhere I'll be bound and you know where to send for him

Then you are mistaken for indeed we don't We want him ourselves
ma'am and can't find him that's the fact

It's all very well talking sir but if you were a married woman with
a family about you and the last at the breast you'd feel very
different from what you do now

I'm d  d if I don't suppose I should said the admiral but as for
the last ma'am I'd soon settle that I'd wring its neck and shove it
overboard

You would you brute It's quite clear to me you never had a child of
your own

Mrs Chillingworth said Henry I think you have no right to complain
to us of your domestic affairs Where your husband goes and what he
does is at his own will and pleasure and really I don't see that we
are to be made answerable as to whether he is at home or abroad to say
nothing of the bad taste and bad taste it most certainly is of talking
of your private affairs to other people

Oh dear said Mrs Chillingworth that's your idea is it you
no-whiskered puppy

Really madam I cannot see what my being destitute of whiskers has to
do with the affair and I am inclined to think my opinion is quite as
good without them as with them

I will speak said Flora to the doctor when I see him

Will you Miss Doll's-eyes Oh dear me you'll speak to the doctor
will you

What on earth do you want said Henry For your husband's sake whom
we all respect we wish to treat you with every imaginable civility but
we tell you candidly that he is not here and therefore we cannot
conceive what more you can require of us

Oh it's a row said the admiral that's what she wants woman like
D  d a bit do they care what it's about as long as there's a
disturbance And now ma'am will you sit down and have a glass of
grog

No I will not sit down and all I can say is that I look upon this
place as a den full of snakes and reptiles That's my opinion so I'll
not stay any longer but wishing that great judgments may some day come
home to you all and that you may know what it is to be a mother with
five babies and one at the breast I despise you all and leave you

So saying Mrs Chillingworth walked from the place feeling herself
highly hurt and offended at what had ensued and they were compelled to
let her go just as she was without giving her any information for they
had a vivid recollection of the serious disturbance she had created on a
former occasion when she had actually headed a mob for the purpose of
hunting out Varney the vampire from Bannerworth Hall and putting an
end consequently as she considered to that set of circumstances which
kept the doctor so much from his house to the great detriment of a not
very extensive practice

After all said Flora Mrs Chillingworth although she is not the
most refined person in the world is to be pitied

What cried the admiral Miss Doll's-eyes are you taking her part

Oh that's nothing She may call me what she likes

I believe she is a good wife to the doctor said Henry
notwithstanding his little eccentricities but suppose we now at once
make the proposal we were thinking of to Sir Francis Varney and so get
him to leave England as quickly as possible and put an end to the
possibility of his being any more trouble to anybody

Agreed agreed It's the best thing that can be done and it will be
something gained to get his consent at once

I'll run up stairs to him said Charles and call him down at once I
scarcely doubt for a moment his acquiescence in the proposal

Charles Holland rose and ran up the little staircase of the cottage to
the room which by the kindness of the Bannerworth family had been
devoted to the use of Varney He had not been gone above two minutes
when he returned hastily with a small scrap of paper in his hand
which he laid before Henry saying 

There what think you of that

Henry upon taking up the paper saw written upon it the words 

The Farewell of Varney the vampire

He is gone said Charles Holland The room is vacant I saw at a
glance that he had removed his hat and cloak and all that belonged to
him He's off and at so short a warning and in so abrupt a manner
that I fear the worst

What can you fear

I scarcely know what but we have a right to fear everything and
anything from his most inexplicable being whose whole conduct has been
of that mysterious nature as to put him past all calculation as regards
his motives his objects or his actions I must confess that I would
have hailed his departure from England with feelings of satisfaction
but what he means now by this strange manoeuvre Heaven and his own
singular intellect can alone divine

I must confess said Flora I should not at all have thought this of
Varney It seems to me as if something new must have occurred to him
Altogether I do not feel any alarm concerning his actions as regards
us I am convinced of his sincerity and therefore do not view with
sensations of uneasiness this new circumstance which appears at present
so inexplicable but for which we may yet get some explanation that will
be satisfactory to us all

I cannot conceive said Henry what new circumstances could have
occurred to produce this effect upon Varney Things remain just as they
were and after all situated as he is if any change had taken place
in matters out of doors I do not see how he could become acquainted
with them so that his leaving must have been a matter of mere
calculation or of impulse at the moment Heaven knows which but can
have nothing to do with actual information because it is quite evident
he could not get it

It is rather strange said Charles Holland that just as we were
speculating upon the probability of his doing something of this sort he
should suddenly do it and in this singular manner too

Oh said the old admiral I told you I saw his eye that was enough
for me I knew he would do something as well as I know a mainmast from
a chain cable He can't help it it's in the nature of the beast and
that's all you can say about it




 XCII

THE MISADVENTURE OF THE DOCTOR WITH THE PICTURE


The situation of Dr Chillingworth and Jack Pringle was not of that
character that permitted much conversation or even congratulation They
were victors it was true and yet they had but little to boast of
besides the victory

Victory is a great thing it is like a gilded coat it bewilders and
dazzles Nobody can say much when you are victorious What a sound and
yet how much misery is there not hidden beneath it

This victory of the worthy doctor and his aid amounted to this they
were as they were before without being any better but much the worse
seeing they were so much buffetted that they could hardly speak but sat
for some moments opposite to each other gasping for breath and staring
each other in the face without speaking

The moonlight came in through the window and fell upon the floor and
there were no sounds that came to disturb the stillness of the scene
nor any object that moved to cast a shadow upon the floor All was still
and motionless save the two victors who were much distressed and
bruised

Well said Jack Pringle with a hearty execration as he wiped his
face with the back of his hand saving your presence doctor we are
masters of the field doctor but it's plaguey like capturing an empty
bandbox after a hard fight

But we have got the picture Jack we have got the picture you see
and that is something I am sure we saved that

Well that may be and a pretty d  d looking picture it is after all
Why it's enough to frighten a lady into the sulks I think it would be
a very good thing if it were burned

Well said the doctor I would sooner see it burned than in the hands
of that 

What exclaimed Jack

I don't know said Mr Chillingworth but thief I should say for it
was somewhat thief-like to break into another man's house and carry off
the furniture

A pirate a regular land shark

Something that is not the same as an honest man Jack but at all
events we have beaten him back this time

Yes said Jack the ship's cleared no company is better than bad
company doctor

So it is and yet it don't seem clear in terms But Jack it you
hadn't come in time I should have been but scurvily treated He was too
powerful for me I was as nigh being killed as ever I have been but you
were just in time to save me

Well he was a large ugly fellow sure enough and looked like an old
tree

Did you see him

Yes to be sure I did

Well I could not catch a glimpse of his features In fact I was too
much employed to see anything and it was much too dark to notice
anything particular even if I had had leisure

Why you had as much to do as you could well manage I must say that
at all events I didn't see much of him myself only he was a tall
out-of-the-way sort of chap a long-legged shark He gave me such a dig
or two as I haven't had for a long while nor don't want to get again
though I don't care if I face the devil himself A man can't do more
than do his best doctor

No Jack but there are very few who do do their best and that's the
truth You have and have done it to some purpose too But I have had
enough for one day he was almost strong enough to contend against us
both

Yes so he was

And besides that he almost carried away the picture that was a great
hindrance to him Don't you think we could have held him if we had not
been fighting over the picture

Yes to be sure we could we could have gone at him bodily and held
him He would not have been able to use his hands We could have hung on
him and I am sure if I came to grapple yard-arm and yard-arm he would
have told a different tale however that is neither here nor there How
long had you been here

Not very long replied the doctor whose head was a little confused by
the blows which he had received I can't now tell how long but only a
short time I think

Where did he come from inquired Jack

Come from Jack

Yes doctor where did he came from the window I suppose the same
way he went out I dare say it's most likely

Oh no no he come down from behind the picture There's some mystery
in that picture I'll swear to it it's very strange he should make such
a desperate attempt to carry it away

Yes one would think said Jack there was more in it than we can
see that it is worth more than we can believe perhaps somebody sets
particular store by it

I don't know said Mr Chillingworth shaking his head I don't know
how that may be but certain it is the picture was the object of his
visit here that is very certain

It was he was endeavouring to carry it off said Jack it would be a
very good ornament to the black hole at Calcutta

The utility of putting it where it cannot be seen remarked Mr
Chillingworth I cannot very well see though I dare say it might be
all very well

Yes its ugly features would be no longer seen so far it would be a
good job But are you going to remain here all night and so make a long
watch of it doctor

Why Jack said the doctor I did intend watching here but now the
game is disturbed it is of no use remaining here We have secured the
picture and now there will be no need of remaining in the house in
fact there is no fear of robbery now

Not so long as we are here said Jack Pringle the smugglers won't
show a head while the revenue cutter is on the look out

Certainly not Jack said Mr Chillingworth I think we have scared
them away the picture is safe

Yes so long as we are here

And longer too I hope

Jack shook his head as much as to intimate that he had many doubts upon
such a point and couldn't be hurried into any concession of opinion of
the safety of such a picture as that much as he disliked it and as
poor an opinion as he had of it

Don't you think it will be safe

No said Jack

And why not said Mr Chillingworth willing to hear what Jack could
advance against the opinion he had expressed especially as he had
disturbed the marauder in the very act of robbery

Why you'll be watched by this very man and when you are gone he will
return in safety and take this plaguey picture away with him

Well he might do so said Mr Chillingworth after some thought he
even endangered his own escape for the purpose of carrying it off

He wants it said Jack

What the picture

Aye to be sure do you think anybody would have tried so hard to get
away with it He wants it and the long and the short of it is he will
have it despite all that can be done to prevent it that's my opinion

Well there is much truth in that but what to do I don't know

Take it to the cottage suggested Jack The picture must be more than
we think for suppose we carry it along

That is no bad plan of yours Jack said Mr Chillingworth and
though a little awkward yet it is not the worst I have heard
but but what will they say when they see this frightful face in that
quiet yet contented house

Why they'll say you brought it said Jack I don't see what else
they can say but that you have done well besides when you come to
explain you will make the matter all right to em

Yes yes said Chillingworth and as the picture now seems to be the
incomprehensible object of attack I will secure that at all events

I'll help you

Thank you Jack your aid will be welcome at least it was so just
now

All right doctor said Jack I may be under your hands some day

I'll physic you for nothing said Mr Chillingworth You saved my
life One good turn deserves another I'll not forget

Thank you said Jack as he made a wry face I hope you won't have
occasion I'd sooner have a can of grog than any bottle of medicine you
can give me I ain't ungrateful neither

You needn't name it I am getting my breath again I suppose we had
better leave this place as soon as we conveniently can

Exactly The sooner the better we can take it the more leisurely as we
go

The moon was up there were no clouds now but there was not a very
strong light because the moon was on the wane It was one of those
nights during which an imperceptible vapour arises and renders the moon
somewhat obscure or at least it robs the earth of her rays and then
there were shadows cast by the moon yet they grew fainter and those
cast upon the floor of the apartment were less distinct than at first

There seemed scarce a breath of air stirring everything was quiet and
still no motion no sound save that of the breathing of the two who
sat in that mysterious apartment who gazed alternately round the place
and then in each other's countenances Suddenly the silence of the
night was disturbed by a very slight but distinct noise which struck
upon them with peculiar distinctness it was a gentle tap tap at the
window as if some one was doing it with their fingernail

They gazed on each other for some moments in amazement and then at
the window but they saw nothing and yet had there been anything they
must have seen it but there was not even a shadow

Well said Mr Chillingworth after he had listened to the tap tap
several times without being able to find out or imagine what it could
arise from what on earth can it be

Don't know said Jack very composedly squinting up at the window
Can't see anything

Well but it must be something persisted Mr Chillingworth it must
be something

I dare say it is but I don't see anything I can't think what it can
be unless 

Unless what Speak out said the doctor impatiently

Why unless it is Davy Jones himself tapping with his long
finger-nails a-telling us as how we've been too long already here

Then I presume we may as well go and yet I am more disposed to deem
it some device of the enemy to dislodge us from this place for the
purpose of enabling them to effect some nefarious scheme or other they
have afloat

It may be and is I dare say a do of some sort or other said Jack
but what can it be

There it is again said the doctor don't you hear it I can as
plain as I can hear myself

Yes said Jack I can hear it plain enough and can see it too and
that is more Yes yes I can tell all about it plain enough

You can Well then shew me said the doctor as he strode up to the
window before which Jack was standing gazing upon one particular spot
of the shattered window with much earnestness

Where is it

Look there said Jack pointing with his finger to a particular spot
to which the doctor directed his attention expecting to see a long
skinny hand tapping against the glass but he saw nothing

Where is it

Do you see that twig of ivy or something of the sort inquired Jack

Yes I do

Very well watch that and when the wind catches it and there is but
very little it lifts it up and then falling down again it taps the
glass

Just as he spoke there came a slight gust of wind and it gave a
practical illustration to his words for the tapping was heard as often
as the plant was moved by the wind

Well said Mr Chillingworth however simple and unimportant the
matter may be yet I cannot but say I am always well pleased to find a
practical explanation of it so that there will be no part left in
doubt

There is none about that said Jack

None Well we are not beset then We may as well consider of the
manner of our getting clear of this place What sort of burthen this
picture may be I know not but I will make the attempt to carry it

Avast there said Jack I will carry it at all events I'll take
the first spell and if I can't go on we'll turn and turn about

We can divide the weight from the first and then neither of us will be
tired at all

Just as you please sir said Jack Pringle I am willing to obey
orders and if we are to get in to-night before they are all a-bed we
had better go at once and then we shall not disturb them

Good Jack said Mr Chillingworth very good let us begin to beat
our retreat at once

Very good said Jack

They both rose and approached the picture which stood up in one corner
half reclining against the wall the light at least so much as there
was fell upon it and gave it a ghastly and deathly hue which made Mr
Chillingworth feel an emotion he could not at all understand but as
soon as he could he withdrew his eyes from off the picture and they
proceeded to secure it with some cord so that they might carry it
between them the easier with less trouble and more safety

These preparations did not take long in making and when completed
they gave another inquiring look round the chamber and Mr
Chillingworth again approached the window and gazed out upon the garden
below but saw nothing to attract his attention

Turning away he came to the picture with which Jack Pringle had been
standing They proceeded towards the stairs adopting every precaution
they could take to prevent any surprise and any attempt upon the object
of their solicitude

Then they came to the great hall and having opened the door they
carried it out then shutting the door they both stood outside of
Bannerworth Hall and before taking the picture up in their hands they
once more looked suspiciously around them

There was nothing to be seen and so shouldering the ominous portrait
they proceeded along the garden till they conveyed it into the roadway

Now said Jack we are off we can scud along under press of sail
you know

I would rather not said the doctor for two reasons one of which
is I can't do it myself and the other is we should run the risk of
injuring the picture besides this there is no reason for so doing

Very well said Jack make it agreeable to yourself doctor See you
Jack's alive and I am willing to do all I can to help you

I am very glad of your aid said Mr Chillingworth so we will
proceed slowly I shall be glad when we are there for there are few
things more awkward than this picture to carry

It is not heavy said Jack giving it a hitch up that first pulled
the doctor back and then pushed him forward again

No but stop don't do that often Jack or else I shall be obliged to
let go to save myself from falling said the doctor

Very sorry said Jack hope it didn't inconvenience you but I could
carry this by myself

And so could I returned Mr Chillingworth but the probability is
there would be some mischief done to it and then we should be doing
more harm than good

So we should said Jack

They proceeded along with much care and caution It was growing late
now and no one was about at least they met none People did not roam
about much after dark especially since the reports of the vampire
became current for notwithstanding all their bravery and violence
while in a body yet to meet and contend with him singly and unseen
was not at all a popular notion among them indeed they would sooner go
a mile out of their way or remain in doors which they usually did

The evening was not precisely dark there was moonlight enough to save
it from that but there was a mist hanging about that rendered objects
at a short distance very indistinct

Their walk was uninterrupted by any one and they had got through half
the distance without any disturbance or interruption whatever

When they arrived at the precincts of the village Jack Pringle said to
Dr Chillingworth Do you intend going through the village doctor

Why not there will be nobody about and if there should be we shall
be safe enough from any molestation seeing there are none here who
would dare to harm us it is the shortest way too

Very good said Jack I am agreeable and as for any one harming me
they know better but at all events there's company and there's less
danger you know doctor though I'm always company to myself but
haven't any objection to a messmate now and then

They pursued their way in silence for some distance the doctor not
caring about continuing the talk of Jack which amounted to nothing
besides he had too much to do for notwithstanding the lightness of
the picture which Jack had endeavoured to persuade the doctor of he
found it was heavy and ungainly indeed had he been by himself he would
have had some trouble to have got it away

We are nearly there said Jack putting down his end of the picture
which brought Doctor Chillingworth to a standstill

Yes we are but what made you stop

Why you see said Jack giving his trowsers a hitch as I said
before we are nearly there

Well what of that we intended to go there did we not inquired
Chillingworth

Yes exactly that is you intended to do so I know but I didn't

What do you mean by that inquired Chillingworth you are a complete
riddle to-night Jack what is the matter with you

Nothing only you see I don't want to go into the cottage cause
you see the admiral and I have had what you may call a bit of a growl
and I am in disgrace there a little though I don't know why or
wherefore I always did my duty by him as I did by my country The ould
man however takes fits into his head at the same time I shall take
some too Jack's as good as his master ashore at all events

Well then you object to go in said Chillingworth

That is the state of the case not that I'm afraid or have any cause
to be ashamed of myself but I don't want to make anybody else
uncomfortable by causing black looks

Very well Jack said the doctor I am much obliged to you and if
you don't like to come I won't press you against your inclination

I understand doctor I will leave you here if you can manage the rest
of the way by yourself there are not two hundred yards now to go so
you are all safe so good bye

Good bye Jack said Doctor Chillingworth who stood wiping his
forehead whilst the picture was standing up against the poles

Do you want a hand up first

No thank you I can get it up very well without any trouble it's not
so heavy

Good bye then said Jack and in a few moments more Jack Pringle
was out of sight and the doctor was alone with the ominous picture He
had not far to go and was within hail of the cottage but it was late
and yet he believed he should find them up for the quietude and
calmness of the evening hour was that which most chimed with their
feelings At such a time they could look out upon the face of nature
and the freedom of thought appeared the greater because there was no
human being to clash with the silence and stillness of the scene

Well muttered Chillingworth I'll go at once to the cottage with my
burthen How they will look at me and wonder what could induce me to
bring this away I can hardly help smiling at the thought of how they
will look at the apparition I shall make

Thus filled with notions that appeared to please him the doctor
shouldered the picture and walked slowly along until he reached the
dead wall that ran up to the entrance or nearly so of the gardens

There was a plantation of young trees that overhung the path and cast a
deep shadow below a pleasant spot in hot weather

The doctor had been carrying the picture resting the side of it on the
small of his arm and against his shoulder but this was an inconvenient
posture because the weight of the picture cut his arm so much that he
was compelled to pause and shift it more on his shoulder

There he muttered that will do for the present and last until I
reach the cottage garden

He was proceeding along at a slow and steady pace bestowing all his
care and attention to the manner of holding the picture when he was
suddenly paralysed by the sound of a great shout of such a peculiar
character that he involuntarily stopped and the next moment something
heavy came against him with great force just as if a man had jumped
from the wall on to him

This was the truth for in another moment and before he could recover
himself he found that there was an attempt to deprive him of the
picture

This at once aroused him and he made an instant and a vigorous defence
but he was compelled to let go his hold of the picture and turn to
resist the infuriated attack that was now commenced upon himself

For some moments it was doubtful who would be the victor but the wind
and strength of the doctor were not enough to resist the powerful
adversary against whom he had to contend and the heavy blows that were
showered down upon him

At first he was enabled to bear up against this attack and then he
returned many of the blows with interest but the stunning effect of the
blows he received himself was such that he could not help himself and
felt his senses gradually failing his strength becoming less and less

In a short time he received such a blow that he was laid senseless on
the earth in an instant

How long he remained thus he could not say but it could not have been
long for all around him seemed just as it was before he was attacked

The moon had scarcely moved and the shadows such as they were were
falling in the same direction as before

I have not been long here he muttered after a few moments'
reflection but but 

He stopped short for on looking around him he saw the object of his
solicitude was gone The picture was nowhere to be seen It had been
carried off the instant he had been vanquished

Gone he said in a low disconsolate tone and after all I have
done

He wiped his hand across his brow and finding it cut he looked at the
back of his hand and saw by the deep colour that it was blood indeed
he could now feel it trickle down his face

What to do he hardly knew he could stand and after having got upon his
feet he staggered back against the wall against which he leaned for
support and afterwards he crept along with the aid of its support
until he came to the door

He was observed from the window where Henry and Charles Holland seeing
him come up with such an unsteady gait rushed to the door to ascertain
what was the matter

What doctor exclaimed Henry Bannerworth what is the matter

I am almost dead I think said Chillingworth Lend me your arm
Henry

Henry and Charles Holland immediately stepped out and took him between
them into the parlour and placed him upon a couch

What on earth has happened doctor have you got into disgrace with
the populace

No no give me some drink some water I am very faint very faint

Give him some wine or what's better some grog said the admiral
Why he's been yard-arm with some pirate or other and he's damaged
about the figure-head You ain't hurt in your lower works are you
doctor said the admiral

But the doctor took no notice of the inquiry but eagerly sipped the
contents of a glass that Charles Holland had poured out of a bottle
containing some strong Hollands and which appeared to nerve him much

There said the admiral that will do you good How did all this
damage to your upper works come about eh

Let him wash his face and hands first he will be better able to talk
afterwards

Oh thank you said Chillingworth I am much better but I have had
some hard bruises

How did it happen

I went by myself to watch in the room where the picture was in
Bannerworth Hall

Where the picture was said Henry where it is you mean do you not
doctor

No where it was and where it is not now

Gone

Yes gone away I'll tell you all about it I went there to watch but
found nobody or nothing there but suddenly a man stepped out from
behind the picture and we had a fight over it after which just as I
was getting the worst of it Jack Pringle came in

The dog muttered the admiral

Yes he came in just in time I believe to save my life for the man
whoever he was would not have hesitated about it

Well Jack is a good man said the admiral there may be worse at
least

Well we had a desperate encounter for some minutes during which this
fellow wanted to carry off the picture

Carry off the picture

Yes we had a struggle for that but we could not capture him he was
so violent that he broke away and got clear off

With the picture

No he left the picture behind Well we were very tired and bruised
and we sat down to recover ourselves from our fatigue and to consider
what was best to be done but we were some time before we could leave
and then we determined that we would take the picture away with us as
it seemed to be coveted by the robber for what object we cannot tell

Well well where is the picture

You shall hear all about it in a minute if you'll let me take my time
I am tired and sore Well we brought the picture out and Jack helped
me carry it till he came within a couple of hundred yards of the
cottage and there left me

The lubber said the admiral interjectionally

Well I rested awhile and then taking the picture on my shoulders I
proceeded along with it until I came to the wall when suddenly I heard
a great shout and then down came something heavy upon me just as if a
man had jumped down upon me

And and 

Yes said the doctor it was 

Was what inquired the admiral

Just what you all seemed to anticipate you are all before me but that
was it

A man

Yes I had a struggle with him and got nearly killed for I am not
equal to him in strength I was sadly knocked about and finally all the
senses were knocked out of me and I was I suppose left for dead

And what became of the picture

I don't know but I suppose it was taken away as when I came to
myself it was gone indeed I have some faint recollection of seeing
him seize the portrait as I was falling

There was a pause of some moments during which all the party appeared
to be employed with their own thoughts and the whole were silent

Do you think it was the same man who attacked you in the house that
obtained the picture at last inquired Henry Bannerworth

I cannot say but I think it most probable that it was the same
indeed the general appearance as near as I could tell in the dark was
the same but what I look upon as much stronger is the object appears
to be the same in both cases

That is very true said Henry Bannerworth very true and I think it
more than probable myself But come doctor you will require rest and
nursing after your dangers




 XCIII

THE ALARM AT ANDERBURY THE SUSPICIONS OF THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY AND
THE MYSTERIOUS COMMUNICATION


Illustration

About twenty miles to the southward of Bannerworth Hall was a good-sized
market-town called Anderbury It was an extensive and flourishing
place and from the beauty of its situation and its contiguity to the
southern coast of England it was much admired and in consequence
numerous mansions and villas of great pretension had sprang up in its
immediate neighbourhood

Betides there were some estates of great value and one of these
called Anderbury-on-the-Mount in consequence of the mansion itself
which was of an immense extent being built upon an eminence was to be
let or sold

This town of Anderbury was remarkable not only for the beauty of its
aspect but likewise for the quiet serenity of its inhabitants who were
a prosperous thriving race and depended very much upon their own
resources

There were some peculiar circumstances why Anderbury-on-the-Mount was to
let It had been for a great number of years in possession of a family
of the name of Milltown who had resided there in great comfort and
respectability until an epidemic disorder broke out first among the
servants and then spreading to the junior branches of the family and
from them to their seniors produced such devastation that in the
course of three weeks there was but one young man left of the whole
family and he by native vigour of constitution had baffled the
disorder and found himself alone in his ancestral halls the last of
his race

Soon a settled melancholy took possession of him and all that had
formerly delighted him now gave him pain inasmuch as it brought to his
mind a host of recollections of the most agonising character

In vain was it that the surrounding gentry paid him every possible
attention and endeavoured to do all that was in their power to
alleviate the unhappy circumstances in which he was placed If he
smiled it was in a sad sort and that was very seldom and at length he
announced his intention of leaving the neighbourhood and seeking
abroad and in change of scene for that solace which he could not
expect to find in his ancestral home after what had occurred within its
ancient walls

There was not a chamber but which reminded him of the past there was
not a tree or a plant of any kind or description but which spoke to him
plainly of those who were now no more and whose merry laughter had
within his own memory made that ancient place echo with glee filling
the sunny air with the most gladsome shouts such as come from the lips
of happy youth long before the world has robbed it of any of its romance
or its beauty

There was a general feeling of regret when this young man announced the
fact of his departure to a foreign land for he was much respected and
the known calamities which he had suffered and the grief under which he
laboured invested his character with a great and painful interest

An entertainment was given to him upon the eve of his departure and on
the next day he was many miles from the place and the estate of
Anderbury-on-the-Mount was understood to be sold or let

The old mansion had remained then for a year or two vacant for it was
a place of too much magnitude and required by far too expensive an
establishment to keep it going to enable any person whose means were
not very large to think of having anything to do with it

So therefore it remained unlet and wearing that gloomy aspect which a
large house untenanted so very quickly assumes

It was quite a melancholy thing to look upon it and to think what it
must have once been and what it might be still compared to what it
actually was and the inhabitants of the neighbourhood had made up their
minds that Anderbury-on-the-Mount would remain untenanted for many a
year to come and perhaps ultimately fall into ruin and decay

But in this they were doomed to be disappointed for on the evening of
a dull and gloomy day about one week after the events we have recorded
as taking place at Bannerworth Hall and its immediate neighbourhood a
travelling carriage with four horses and an out-rider came dashing
into the place and drew up at the principal inn in the town which was
called the Anderbury Arms

The appearance of such an equipage although not the most unusual thing
in the world in consequence of the many aristocratic families who
resided in the neighbourhood caused at all events some sensation
and perhaps the more so because it drove up to the inn instead of to
any of the mansions of the neighbourhood thereby showing that the
stranger whoever he was came not as a visitor but either merely
baited in the town being on his road somewhere else or had some
special business in it which would soon be learned

The out-rider who was in handsome livery had gallopped on in advance
of the carriage a short distance for the purpose of ordering the best
apartments in the inn to be immediately prepared for the reception of
his master

Who is he asked the landlord

It's the Baron Stolmuyer Saltsburgh

Bless my heart I never heard of him before where did he come
from somewhere abroad I suppose

I can't tell you anything of him further than that he is immensely
rich and is looking for a house He has heard that there is one to let
in this immediate neighbourhood and that's what has brought him from
London I suppose

Yes there is one and it is called Anderbury-on-the-Mount

Well he will very likely speak to you about it himself for here he
comes

By this time the carriage had halted at the door of the hotel and the
door being opened and the steps lowered there alighted from it a tall
man attired in a kind of pelisse or cloak trimmed with rich fur the
body of it being composed of velvet Upon his head he wore a travelling
cap and his fingers as he grasped the cloak around him were seen to
be covered with rings of great value

Such a personage coming in such style was of course likely to be
honoured in every possible way by the landlord of the inn and
accordingly he was shown most obsequiously to the handsomest apartment
in the house and the whole establishment was put upon the alert to
attend to any orders he might choose to give

He had not been long in the place when he sent for the landlord who
hastily scrambling on his best coat and getting his wife to arrange the
tie of his neckcloth proceeded to obey the orders of his illustrious
guest whatever they might chance to be

He found the Baron Stolmuyer reclining upon a sofa and having thrown
aside his velvet cloak trimmed with rich fur he showed that underneath
it he wore a costume of great richness and beauty although certainly
the form it covered was not calculated to set it off to any great
advantage for the baron was merely skin and bone and looked like a man
who had just emerged from a long illness for his face was ghastly pale
and the landlord could not help observing that there was a strange
peculiarity about his eyes the reason of which he could not make out

You are the landlord of this inn I presume said the baron and
consequently no doubt well acquainted with the neighbourhood

I have the honour to be all that sir I have been here about sixteen
years and in that time I certainly ought to know something of the
neighbourhood

'Tis well some one told me there was a little cottage sort of place to
let here and as I am simple and retired in my habits I thought that it
might possibly suit me

A little cottage sir There are certainly little cottages to let but
not such as would suit you and if I might have presumed sir to think
I should have considered Anderbury-on-the-Mount which is now to let
would have been the place for you It is a large place sir and
belonged to a good family although they are now all dead and gone
except one and it's he who wants to let the old place

Anderbury-on-the-Mount said the baron was the name of the place
mentioned to me but I understood it was a little place

Oh sir that is quite a mistake who told you so It's the largest
place about here there are a matter of twenty-seven rooms in it and it
stands altogether upon three hundred acres of ground

And have you the assurance said the baron to call that anything but
a cottage when the castle of the Stolmuyers at Saltzburgh has one
suite of reception rooms thirty in number opening into each other and
the total number of apartments in the whole building is two hundred
and sixty it is surrounded by eight miles of territory

The devil said the landlord I beg your pardon sir but when I am
astonished I generally say the devil They want eight hundred pounds a
year for Anderbury-on-the-Mount

A mere trifle I will sleep here to-night and in the morning I will go
and look at the place It is near the sea

Half a mile sir exactly from the beach and one of the most curious
circumstances of all connected with it is that there is a subterranean
passage from the grounds leading right away down to the sea-coast A
most curious place sir partly cut out of the cliff with cellars in it
for wine and other matters that in the height of summer are kept as
cool as in the deep winter time It's more for curiosity than use such
a place and the old couple that now take care of the house make a
pretty penny I'll be bound though they won't own it by showing that
part of the place

It may suit me but I shall be able to give a decisive answer when I
see it on the morrow You will let my attendants have what they require
and see that my horses be well looked to

Certainly oh certainly sir of course you might go far indeed
sir before you found an inn where everything would be done as things
are done here Is there anything in particular sir you would like for
dinner

How can I tell that idiot until the dinner time arrives

Well but sir in that case you know we scarcely know what to do
because you see sir you understand 

It is very strange to me that you can neither see nor understand your
duty I am accustomed to having the dinner tables spread with all that
money can procure then I choose but not before what it suits me to
partake of

Wil sir that is a very good way and perhaps we ain't quite so used
to that sort of thing as we ought to be in these parts but another
time sir we shall know better what we are about without a doubt and
I only hope sir that we shall have you in the neighbourhood for a long
time and so sir putting one thing to another and then drawing a
conclusion from both of them you see sir you will be able to
understand

Peace begone what is the use of all this bellowing to me I want it
not I care not for it

The baron spoke these words so furiously that the landlord was rather
terrified than otherwise and left the room hastily muttering to
himself that he had never come across such a tiger and wondering where
the baron could have possibly come from and what amount of wealth he
could be possessed of that would enable him to live in such a princely
style as he mentioned

If the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh had wished ever so much to impress
upon the minds of all persons in the neighbourhood the fact of his
wealth and importance he could not have adopted a better plan to
accomplish that object than by first of all impressing such facts upon
the mind of the landlord of the Anderbury Arms for in the course of
another hour it was tolerably well spread all over the town that never
had there been such a guest at the Anderbury Arms and that he called
Anderbury-on-the-Mount with all its rooms all its outbuildings and
its three hundred acres of ground a cottage

This news spread like wildfire awaking no end of speculation and
giving rise to the most exaggerated rumours so that a number of persons
came to the inn on purpose to endeavour to get a look at the baron but
he did not stir from his apartments so that these wondermongers were
disappointed and even forced to go away as wise as they came but in
the majority of cases they made up their minds that in the morning they
should surely be able to obtain a glimpse of him which was considered a
great treat for a man with an immense income is looked upon in England
as a natural curiosity

The landlord took his guest at his word as regards the dinner and
provided such a repast as seldom indeed graced the board at the
Anderbury Arms a repast sufficient for twenty people and certainly
which was a monstrous thing to set before one individual

The baron however made no remark but selected a portion from some of
the dishes and those dishes that he did select from were of the
simplest kind and not such as the landlord expected him to take so
that he really paid about one hundred times the amount he ought to have
done for what actually passed his lips

And then what a fidget the landlord was in about his wines for he
doubted not but such a guest would be extremely critical and hard to
please but to his great relief the baron declined taking any wine
merely washing down his repast with a tumbler of cool water and then
although the hour was very early he retired at once to rest

The landlord was not disposed to disregard the injunction which the
baron had given him to attend carefully on his servants and horses and
after giving orders that nothing should be stinted as regarded the
latter he himself looked to the creature-comforts of the former and he
did this with a double motive for not only was he anxious to make the
most he could out of the baron in the way of charges but he was
positively panting with curiosity to know more about so singular a
personage and he thought that surely the servants must be able to
furnish him with some particulars regarding their eccentric master

In this however he was mistaken for although they told him all they
knew that amounted to so little as really not to be worth the learning

They informed him that they had been engaged all in the last week and
that they knew nothing of the baron whatever or where he came from or
what he was excepting that he paid them most liberal wages and was not
very exacting in the service he required of them

This was very unsatisfactory and when the landlord started on a
mission which he considered himself bound to perform to a Mr Leek in
the town who had the letting of Anderbury-on-the-Mount he was quite
vexed to think what a small amount of information he was able to carry
to him

I can tell him he said to himself as he went quickly towards the
agent's residence I can tell him the baron's name and that in the
morning he wants to look at Anderbury-on-the-Mount but that's all I
know of him except that he is a most extraordinary man indeed the
most extraordinary that I ever came near

Mr Leek the house agent notwithstanding the deficiency of the facts
contained in the landlord's statement was well enough satisfied to hear
that any one of apparent wealth was inquiring after the large premises
to let for as he said truly to the landlord 

The commission on letting and receiving the rentals of such a property
is no joke to me

Precisely said the landlord I thought it was better to come and
tell you at once for there can be no doubt that he is enormously rich

If that be satisfactorily proved it's of no consequence what he is or
who he is and you may depend I shall be round to the inn early in the
morning to attend upon him and in that case perhaps if you have any
conversation with him you will be so good as to mention that I will
show him over the premises at his own hour and you shall not be
forgotten you may depend if any arrangement is actually come to It
will be just as well for you to tell him what a nice property it is and
that it is to be let for eight hundred a year or sold outright for
eight thousand pounds

I will you may depend Mr Leek A most extraordinary man you will
find him not the handsomest in the world I can tell you but handsome
is as handsome does say I and if he takes Anderbury-on-the-Mount I
have no doubt but he will spend a lot of money in the neighbourhood and
we shall all be the better of that of course as you well know sir

This then was thoroughly agreed upon between these high contracting
powers and the landlord returned home very well satisfied indeed with
the position in which he had put the affair and resolved upon urging on
the baron as far as it lay within his power so to do to establish
himself in the neighbourhood and to allow him to be purveyor-in-general
to his household which if the baron continued in his liberal humour
would be unquestionably a very pleasant post to occupy




 XCIV

THE VISITOR AND THE DEATH IN THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE


Illustration

About an hour and a half after the baron had retired to rest and while
the landlord was still creeping about enjoining silence on the part of
the establishment so that the slumbers of a wealthy and no doubt
illustrious personage should not be disturbed there arrived a horseman
at the Anderbury Arms

He was rather a singular-looking man with a shifting uneasy-looking
glance as if he were afraid of being suddenly pounced upon and
surprised by some one and although his apparel was plain yet it was
good in quality and his whole appearance was such as to induce
respectful attention

The only singular circumstance was that such a traveller so well
mounted should be alone but that might have been his own fancy so
that the absence of an attendant went for nothing Doubtless if the
whole inn had not been in such a commotion about the illustrious and
wealthy baron this stranger would have received more consideration and
attention than he did

Upon alighting he walked at once into what is called the coffee-room of
the hotel and after ordering some refreshments of which he partook but
sparingly he said in a mild but solemn sort of tone to the waiter who
attended upon him 

Tell the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh that there is one here who
wants to see him

I beg your pardon sir said the waiter but the baron is gone to
bed

It matters not to me If you nor no one else in this establishment will
deliver the message I charge you with I must do so myself

I'll speak to my master sir but the baron is a very great gentleman
indeed and I don't think my master would like to have him disturbed

The stranger hesitated for a time and then he said 

Show me the baron's apartment Perhaps I ought not to ask any one
person connected with this establishment to disturb him when I am quite
willing to do so myself Show me the way

Well but sir the baron may get in a rage and say very naturally
that we had no business to let anybody walk up to his room and disturb
him because we wouldn't do so ourselves So that you see sir when you
come to consider it hardly seems the right sort of thing

Since said the stranger rising I cannot procure even the common
courtesy of being shown to the apartment of the person whom I seek I
must find him myself

As he spoke he walked out of the room and began ascending the
staircase despite the remonstrances of the waiter who called after him
repeatedly but could not induce him to stop and when he found that
such was the case he made his way to the landlord to give the alarm
that for all he knew to the contrary some one had gone up stairs to
murder the baron

This information threw the landlord into such a fix that he knew not
what to be at At one moment he was for rushing up stairs and
endeavouring to interfere and at another he thought the best plan would
be to pretend that he knew nothing about it

While he was in this state of uncertainty the stranger succeeded in
making his way up stairs to the floor from which proceeded the bedrooms
and apparently having no fear whatever of the Baron Stolmuyer's
indignation before his eyes he opened door after door until he came to
one which led him into the apartment occupied by that illustrious
individual

The baron half undressed only lay in an uneasy slumber upon the bed
and the stranger stood opposite to him for some minutes as if
considering what he should do

It would be easy he said to kill him but it will pay me better to
spare him I may be wrong in supposing that he has the means which I
hope he has but that I shall soon discover by his conversation

Stretching out his hand he tapped the baron lightly on the shoulder
who thereupon opened his eyes and sprang to his feet instantly glancing
with fixed earnestness at the intruder upon whose face shone the light
of a lamp which was burning in the apartment

Then the baron shrunk back and the stranger folding his arms said 

You know me Let our interview be as brief as possible There needs no
explanations between us for we both know all that could be said By
some accident you have become rich while I continue quite otherwise It
matters not how this has occurred the fact is everything I don't know
the amount of your possessions but from your style of living they
must be great and therefore it is that I make no hesitation in asking
of you as a price for not exposing who and what you are a moderate
sum

I thought that you were dead

I know you did but you behold me here and consequently that
delusion vanishes

What sum do you require and what assurance can I have that when you
get it the demand will not be repeated on the first opportunity

I can give you no such assurance perhaps that would satisfy you
entirely but for more reasons than I choose to enter into I am
extremely anxious to leave England at once and forever Give me the
power to do so that I require and you will never hear of me again

Illustration

The baron hesitated for some few seconds during which he looked
scrutinizingly at his companion and then he said in a tone of voice
that seemed as if he were making the remark to himself rather than to
the other 

You look no older than you did when last we parted and that was years
ago

Why should I look older You know as well as I that I need not But to
be brief I do not wish to interfere with any plans or projects you may
have on hand I do not wish to be a hindrance to you Let me have five
thousand pounds and I am off at once and forever I tell you

Five thousand the man raves five thousand pounds Say one thousand
and it is yours

No I have fixed my price and if you do not consent I now tell you
that I will blazon forth even in this house who and what you are and
let your schemes of ambition or of cupidity be what they may you may be
assured that I will blast them all

This is no place in which to argue such a point come out into the open
air walls have ears but come out and I will give you such special
reasons why you should not now press your claim at all that you shall
feel much beholden to me for them and not regret your visit

If that we come to terms I no more desire than you can do that any one
should overhear our conversation I prefer the open air for any
conference be it whatever it may much prefer it and therefore most
willingly embrace your proposition Come out

The baron put on his travelling cap and the rich velvet cloak edged
with fur that he possessed and leaving his chamber a few paces in
advance of his strange visitor he descended the staircase followed by
him In the hall of the hotel they found the landlord and almost the
whole of the establishment assembled in deep consultation as to whether
or not any one was to go up stairs and ascertain if the stranger who had
sought the baron's chamber was really a friend or an enemy

But when they saw the two men coming down at all events apparently
amicably it was a great relief and the landlord rushed forward and
opened the door for which piece of service he got a very stately bow
from the baron and a slight inclination of the head from his visitor
and then they both passed out

I have ascertained said the man who came on horseback that for the
last week in London you have lived in a style of the most princely
magnificence and that you came down here attended as if you were one
of the first nobles of the land

These things amuse the vulgar said the baron I do not mind
admitting to you that I contemplate residing on this spot and perhaps
contracting a marriage

Another marriage

And why not If wives will die suddenly and no one knows why who is
to help it I do not pretend to control the fates

This between us is idle talk indeed most idle for we know there are
certain circumstances which account for the strangest phenomena but
what roaring sound is that which comes so regularly and steadily upon
the ear

It is the sea washing upon the coast The tide is no doubt advancing
and as the eddying surges roll in upon the pebbly shore they make
what to my mind is this pleasant music

I did not think we were so near the ocean The moon is rising let us
walk upon the beach and as that sound is such pleasant music you shall
hear it while I convince you what unpleasant consequences will arise
from a refusal of the modest and moderate terms I offer you

We shall see we shall see but I must confess it does seem to me most
extraordinary that you ask of me a positive fortune for fear you should
deprive me of a portion of one but you cannot mean what you say

While they were talking they reached a long strip of sand which was by
the seashore at the base of some cliffs through which was excavated
the passage from the coast into the grounds of Anderbury House and
which had been so expatiated upon by the landlord of the inn in his
description of the advantages attendant upon that property

There were some rude steps leading to a narrow arched door-way which
constituted an entrance to this subterraneous region and as the
moonlight streamed over the wide waste of waters and fell upon this
little door-way in the face of the cliff he became convinced that it
was the entrance to that excavation and he eyed it curiously

What place is that said his companion

It is a private entrance to the grounds of a mansion in this
neighbourhood

Private enough I should presume for if there be any other means of
reaching the house surely no one would go through such a dismal hole as
that towards it but come make up your mind at once There need be no
quarrelling upon the subject of our conference but let it be a plain
matter of yes or no Is it worth your while to be left alone in peace
or is it not

It is worth my while but not at such a price as that you mentioned
and I cannot help thinking that some cheaper mode of accomplishing the
same object will surely present itself very shortly

I do not understand you you talk ambiguously

But my acts said the baron shall be clear and plain enough as you
shall see Could you believe it possible that I was the sort of person
to submit tamely to any amount of extortion you chose to practise upon
me There was a time when I thought you possessed great sense and
judgment when I thought that you were a man who weighed well the chances
of what you were about but now I know to the contrary and I think for
less than a thousand pounds I may succeed in ridding myself of you

I do not understand you you had better beware how you tamper with me
for I am not one who will be calmly disposed to put up with much The
sense tact and worldly knowledge which you say you have before from
time to time given me credit for belongs to me still and I am not
likely easily to commit myself

Indeed do you think you bear such a charmed life that nothing can
shake it

I think nothing of the sort but I know what I can do I am armed

And I and since it comes to this take the reward of your villany for
it was you who made me what I am and would now seek to destroy my every
hope of satisfaction

As the baron spoke he drew from his breast a small pistol which with
the quickness of thought he held full in the face of his companion and
pulled the trigger

There can be no doubt on earth that his intention was to commit the
murder but the pistol missed fire and he was defeated in his intention
at that moment Then the stranger laughed scornfully and drawing a
pistol from his pocket he presented it at the baron's head saying 

Do I not bear a charmed life If I had not should I have escaped death
from you now No I could not but you perceive that even a weapon that
might not fail you upon another occasion is harmless against me and can
you expect that I will hesitate now to take full and ample revenge upon
you for this dastardly attempt

These words were spoken with great volubility so much so indeed that
they only occupied a few very brief seconds in delivering and then
perhaps the baron's career might have ended for it seemed to be fully
the intention of the other to conclude what he said by firing the pistol
in his face but the wily aspect of the baron's countenance was after
all but a fair index of the mind and just as the last words passed
the lips of his irritated companion he suddenly dropped in a crouching
position to the ground and seizing his legs threw him over his head
in an instant

The pistol was discharged at the same moment and then with a shout of
rage and satisfaction the baron sprang upon his foe and kneeling upon
his breast he held aloft in his hand a glittering dagger the
highly-polished blade of which caught the moonbeams and reflected them
into the dazzled eyes of the conquered man whose fate now appeared to
be certain

Fool said the baron you must needs then try conclusions with me
and not content with the safety of insignificance you must be absurd
enough to think it possible you could extort from me whatever sums your
fancy dictated or with any effect threaten me if I complied not with
your desires

Have mercy upon me I meant not to take your life and therefore why
should you take mine

You would have taken it and therefore you shall die Know too as
this is your last moment that vampire as you are and as I of all
men best know you to be I will take especial care that you shall be
placed in some position after death where the revivifying moonbeams may
not touch you so that this shall truly be your end and you shall rot
away leaving no trace behind of your existence sufficient to contain
the vital principle

No no you cannot will not You will have mercy

Ask the famished tiger for mercy when you intrude upon his den

As he spoke the baron ground his teeth together with rage and in an
instant buried the poniard in the throat of his victim The blade went
through to the yellow sand beneath and the murderer still knelt upon
the man's chest while he who had thus received so fatal a blow tossed
his arms about with agony and tried in vain to shriek

The nature of the wound however prevented him from uttering anything
but a low gurgling sound for he was nearly choked with his own blood
and soon his eyes became fixed and of a glassy appearance he stretched
out his two arms and dug his fingers deep into the sand

The baron drew forth the poniard and a gush of blood immediately
followed it and then one deep groan testified to the fact that the
spirit if there be a spirit had left its mortal habitation and winged
its flight to other realms if there be other realms for it to wing its
flight to

He is dead said the baron and at the same moment a roll of the
advancing tide swept over the body drenching the living as well as the
dead with the brine of the ocean

The baron stooped and rinsed the dagger in the advancing tide from the
clotted blood which had clung to it and then wiping it carefully he
returned it to its sheath which was hidden within the folds of his
dress and rising from his kneeling posture upon the body he stood by
its side with folded arms gazing upon it for some minutes in
silence heedless of the still advancing water which was already
considerably above his feet

Then he spoke in his ordinary accents and evidently caring nothing for
the fact that he had done such a deed

I must dispose of this carcase he said which now seems so lifeless
for the moon is up and if its beams fall upon it I know from former
experience what will happen it will rise again and walk the earth
seeking for vengeance upon me and the thirst for that vengeance will
become such a part of its very nature that it will surely accomplish
something if not all that it desires

After a few moments consideration he stooped and with more strength
than one would have thought it possible a man reduced almost as he was
to a skeleton could have exerted he lifted the body and carried it
rapidly up the beach towards the cliffs He threw it down upon the stone
steps that led to the small door of the excavation in the cliff and it
fell upon them with a sickening sound as if some of the bones were
surely broken by the fall

The object then of the baron seemed to be to get this door open if he
possibly could but that was an object easier to be desired than carried
into effect for although he exerted his utmost power he did not
succeed in moving it an inch and he began evidently to think that it
would be impossible to do so

But yet he did not give up the attempt at once but looking about upon
the beach until he found a large heavy stone he raised it in his arms
and approaching the door he flung it against it with such tremendous
force that it flew open instantly disclosing within a dark and narrow
passage

Apparently rejoiced that he had accomplished this much he stopped
cautiously within the entrance and then taking from a concealed pocket
that was in the velvet cloak which he wore a little box he produced
from it some wax-lights and some chemical matches which by the
slightest effort he succeeded in igniting and then with one of the
lights in his hand to guide him on his way he went on exploring the
passage and treading with extreme caution as he went for fear of
falling into any of the ice-wells which were reported to be in that
place

After proceeding about twenty yards and finding that there was no
danger he became less cautious but in consequence of such less
caution he very nearly sacrificed his life for he came upon an
ice-well which seemed a considerable depth and into which he had nearly
plunged headlong

He started back with some degree of horror but that soon left him and
then after a moment's thought he sought for some little nook in the
wall in which he might place the candle and soon finding one that
answered the purpose well he there left it having all the appearance
of a little shrine while he proceeded again to the mouth of that
singular and cavernous-looking place He had evidently quite made up
his mind what to do for without a moment's hesitation he lifted the
body again and carried it within the entrance walking boldly and
firmly now that he knew there was no danger between him and the light
which shed a gleam through the darkness of the place of a very faint and
flickering character

He reached it rapidly and when he got to the side of the well he
without a moment's hesitation flung it headlong down and listening
attentively he heard it fall with a slight plash as if there was some
water at the bottom of the pit

It was an annoyance however for him to find that the distance was not
so deep as he had anticipated and when he took the light from the niche
where he had placed it and looked earnestly down he could see the
livid ghastly-looking face of the dead man for the body had
accidentally fallen upon its back which was a circumstance he had not
counted upon and one which increased the chances greatly of its being
seen should any one be exploring from curiosity that not very
inviting place

This was annoyance but how could it be prevented unless indeed he
chose to descend and make an alteration in the disposition of the
corpse But this was evidently what he did not choose to do so after
muttering to himself a few words expressive of his intention to leave it
where it was he replaced the candle after extinguishing it in the box
from whence he had taken it and carefully walked out of the dismal
place

The moonbeams were shining very brightly and beautifully upon the face
of the cliffs when he emerged from the subterranean passage so that he
could see the door the steps and every object quite distinctly and
to his gratification he found that he had not destroyed any fastening
that was to the door but that when it was slammed shut it struck so
hard and fast that the strength of one man could not possibly move it
even the smallest fraction of an inch

I shall be shown all this to-morrow he said and if I take this
house I must have an alteration made in this door so that it may open
with a lock instead of by main violence as at present but if in the
morning when I view Anderbury House I can avoid an entrance into this
region I will do so and at my leisure if I become the possessor of
the estate I can explore every nook and cranny of it

He then folded his cloak about him after pulling the door as closely as
he could He walked slowly and thoughtfully back to the inn It was
quite evident that the idea of the murder he had committed did not annoy
him in the least and that in his speculations upon the subject he
congratulated himself much upon having so far succeeded in getting rid
of certainly a most troublesome acquaintance

'Tis well indeed he said that just at this juncture he should
throw himself in my way and enable me so easy to feel certain that I
shall never more be troubled with him Truly I ran some risk and when
my pistol missed fire it seemed as if my evil star was in its
ascendant and that I was doomed myself to become the victim of him whom
I have laid in so cold a grave But I have been victorious and I am
willing to accept the circumstance as an omen of the past that my
fortunes are on the change I think I shall be successful now and with
the ample means which I now possess surely in this country where gold
is loved so well I shall be able to overcome all difficulties and to
unite myself to some one who but no matter her fate is an after
consideration

THE MARRIAGE IN THE BANNERWORTH FAMILY ARRANGED


Illustration

After the adventure of the doctor with regard to the picture about which
such an air of mystery and interest has been thrown the Bannerworth
family began to give up all hopes of ever finding a clue to those
circumstances concerning which they would certainly have liked to have
known the truth but of which it was not likely they would ever hear
anything more

Dr Chillingworth now had no reserve and when he had recovered
sufficiently to feel that he could converse without an effort he took
an opportunity while the whole of the family were present to speak of
what had been his hopes and his expectations

You are all aware he said now of the story of Marmaduke
Bannerworth and what an excessively troublesome person he was with all
deference to you Henry first of all as to spending all his money at
the gaming-table and leaving his family destitute and then when he
did get a lump of money which might have done some good to those he left
behind him hiding it somewhere where it could not be found at all and
so leaving you all in great difficulty and distress when you might have
been independent

That's true enough doctor said Henry but you know the old
proverb that ill-gotten wealth never thrives so that I don't regret
not finding this money for I am sure we should have been none the
happier with it and perhaps not so happy

Oh bother the old proverb thirty or forty thousand pounds is no
trifle to be talked lightly of or the loss of which to be quietly put
up with on account of a musty proverb It's a large sum and I should
like to have placed it in your hands

But as you cannot doctor there can be no good possibly done by
regretting it

No certainly I don't mean that utter regret is always a very foolish
thing but it's questionable whether something might not be done in the
matter after all for you as it appears by all the evidence we can
collect that it must have been Varney after all who jumped down upon
me from the garden-wall in so sudden a manner and if the picture be
valuable to him it must be valuable to us

But how are we to get it and if we could I do not see that it would
be of much good to anybody for after all it is but a painting

There you go again said the doctor depreciating what you know
nothing about now listen to me Master Henry and I will tell you
That picture evidently had some sort of lining at the back over the
original canvas and do you think I would have taken such pains to bring
it away with me if that lining had not made me suspect that between it
and the original picture the money in bank notes was deposited

Had you any special reason for supposing such was the case

Yes most unquestionably I had for when I got the picture fairly down
I found various inequalities in the surface of the back which led me to
believe that rolls of notes were deposited and that the great mistake
we had all along made was in looking behind the picture instead of at
the picture itself I meant immediately to have cut it to pieces when I
reached here with it but now it has got into the hands of somebody
else who knows I suspect as much I do

It is rather provoking

Rather provoking is that the way to talk of the loss of Heaven knows
how many thousands of pounds I am quite aggravated myself at the idea
of the thing and it puts me in a perfect fever to think of it I can
assure you

But what can we do

Oh I propose an immediate crusade against Varney the vampire for who
but he could have made such an attack upon me and force me to deliver
up such a valuable treasure

Never heed it doctor said Flora let it go we have never had or
enjoyed that money so it cannot matter and it is not to be considered
as the loss of an actual possession because we never did actually
possess it

Yes chimed in the admiral bother the money what do we care about
it and besides Charley Holland is going to be very busy

Busy said the doctor how do you mean

Why isn't he going to be married directly to Flora here and am not I
going to settle the whole of my property upon him on condition that he
takes the name of Bell instead of Holland for you see his mother was
my sister and of course her name was Bell As for his father Holland
it can't matter to him now what Charley is called and if he don't take
the name of Bell I shall be the last in the family for I am not likely
to marry and have any little Bells about me

No said the doctor I should say not and that's the reason why you
want to ring the changes upon Charles Holland's name Do you see the
joke admiral

I can't say I do where is it It's all very well to talk of jokes but
if I was like Charles going to be married I shouldn't be in any joking
humour I can tell you but quite the reverse and as for you and your
picture if you want it doctor just run after Varney yourself for it
or stay I have a better idea than that get your wife to go and ask
him for it and if she makes half such a clamour about his ears that she
did about ours he will give it her in a minute to get rid of her

My wife you don't mean to say she has been here

Yes but she has though And now doctor I can tell you I have seen a
good deal of service in all parts of the world and of course picked
up a little experience and if I were you some of these days when
Mrs Chillingworth ain't very well I'd give her a composing draught
that would make her quiet enough

Ah that's not my style of practice admiral but I am sorry to hear
that Mrs Chillingworth has annoyed you so much

Pho pho man pho pho do you think she could annoy me Why I have
encountered storms and squalls in all latitudes and it isn't a woman's
tongue now that can do anything of an annoying character I can tell
you far from it very far from it so don't distress yourself upon that
head But come doctor we are going to have the wedding the day after
to-morrow

No no said Flora the week after next you mean

Is it the week after next I'll be hanged if I didn't think it was the
day after to-morrow but of course you know best as you have settled it
all among you I have nothing to do with it

Of course I shall with great pleasure returned the doctor be
present on the interesting occasion but do you intend taking possession
of Bannerworth Hall again

No certainly not said Henry we propose going to the Dearbrook
estate and there remaining for a time to see how we all like it We
may perchance enjoy it very much for I have heard it spoken of as an
attractive little property enough and one that any one might fancy
after being resident a short time upon it

Well said the admiral that is I believe settled among us but I
am sure we sha'n't like it on account of the want of the sea Why I
tell you I have not seen a ship myself for this eighteen months
there's a state of things you see that won't do to last because one
would get dry-mouldy it's a shocking thing to see nothing but land
land wherever you go

From the preceding conversation may be gathered what were the designs of
the Bannerworth family and what progress had been made in carrying them
out From the moment they had discovered the title-deeds of the
Dearbrook property they had ceased to care about the large sum of money
which Marmaduke Bannerworth had been supposed to have hidden in some
portion of Bannerworth Hall

They had already passed through quite enough of the busy turmoils of
existence to be grateful for anything that promised ease and competence
and that serenity of mind which is the dearest possession which any one
can compass

Consequently was it that with one accord they got rid of all yearning
after the large sum which the doctor was so anxious to procure for them
and looked forward to a life of great happiness and contentment On the
whole too when they came to talk the matter over quietly among
themselves they were not sorry that Varney had taken himself off in the
way he had for really it was a great release and as he had couched
his farewell in words which signified it was a final one they were
inclined to think that he must have left England and that it was not
likely they should ever again encounter him under any circumstances
whatever

It was to be considered quite as a whim of the old admiral's the
changing of Charles Holland's name to Bell but as Charles himself said
when the subject was broached to him I am so well content to be
called whatever those to whom I feel affection think proper that I give
up my name of Holland without a pang willingly adopting in its stead
one that has always been hallowed in my remembrance with the best and
kindest recollections

And thus this affair was settled much to the satisfaction of Flora who
was quite as well content to be called Mrs Bell as to be called Mrs
Holland since the object of her attachment remained the same The
wedding was really fixed for the week after that which followed the
conversation we have recorded but the admiral was not at all disposed
to allow Flora and his nephew Charles to get through such an important
period of their lives without some greater demonstration and show than
could be made from the little cottage where they dwelt and consequently
he wished that they should leave that and proceed at once to a larger
mansion which he had his eye upon a few miles off and which was to be
had furnished for a time at the pleasure of any one

And we won't shut ourselves up said the admiral but we will find
out all the Christian-like people in the neighbourhood and invite them
to the wedding and we will have a jolly good breakfast together and
lots of music and a famous lunch and after that a dinner and then a
dance and all that sort of thing so that there shall be no want of
fun

As may be well supposed both Charles and Flora shrunk from so public an
affair but as the old man had evidently set his heart upon it they
did not like to say they positively would not so after a vain attempt
to dissuade him from removing at all from the cottage until they removed
for good they gave up the point to him and he had it all his own way

He took the house for one month which had so taken his fancy and
certainly a pretty enough place it was although they found out
afterwards that why it was he was so charmed with it consisted in the
fact that it bore the name of a vessel which he had once commanded but
this they did not know until a long time afterwards when it slipped out
by mere accident

They stipulated with the admiral that there should not be more than
twenty guests at the breakfast which was to succeed the marriage
ceremony and to that he acceded but Henry whispered to Charles
Holland 

I know this public wedding to be distasteful to you and most
particularly do I know it is distasteful to Flora so if you do not
mind playing a trick upon the old man I can very easily put you in the
way of cheating him entirely

Indeed I should like to hear and what is more I should like to
practise if you think it will not so entirely offend him as to make him
implacable

Not at all not at all he will laugh himself when he comes to know
it as much as any of us the present difficulty will be to procure
Flora's connivance but that we must do the best way we can by
persuasion

What this scheme was will ultimately appear but certain it is that
the old admiral had no suspicion of what was going on and proceeded to
make all his arrangements accordingly

From his first arrival in the market town in the neighbourhood of which
was Bannerworth Hall it will be recollected that he had taken a great
fancy to the lawyer in whose name a forged letter had been sent him
informing him of the fact that his nephew Charles Holland intended
marrying into a family of vampires

It was this letter as the reader is aware which brought the old
admiral and Jack Pringle into the neighbourhood of the Hall and
although it was a manoeuvre to get rid of Charles Holland which failed
most signally there can be no doubt but that such a letter was the
production of Sir Francis Varney and that he wrote it for the express
purpose of getting rid of Charles from the Hall who had begun
materially to interfere with his plans and projects there

After some conversation with himself the admiral thought that this
lawyer would be just the man to recommend the proper sort of people to
be invited to the wedding of Charles and Flora so he wrote to him
inviting himself to dinner and received back a very gracious reply from
the lawyer who declared that the honour of entertaining a gentleman
whom he so much respected as Admiral Bell was greater than he had a
right to expect by a great deal and that he should feel most grateful
for his company and await his coming with the greatest impatience

A devilish civil fellow that attorney said the admiral as he put
the letter in his pocket and almost enough to put one in conceit of
lawyers

Yes said Jack Pringle who had overheard the admiral read the letter

Yes we will honour him and I only hope he will have plenty of grog
because you see if he don't D n it what's that Can't you keep
things to yourself

This latter exclamation arose from the fact that the admiral was so
indignant at Jack for listening to what he had been saying as to throw
a leaden inkstand that happened to be upon the table at his head

You mutinous swab he said cannot a gentleman ask me to dinner or
cannot I ask myself without you putting your spoke in the windlass you
vagabond

Oh well said Jack if you are out of temper about it I had better
send my mark to the lawyer and tell him that we won't come as it has
made some family differences

Family you thief said the admiral What do you mean What family do
you think would own you D n me if I don't think you came over in some
strange ship But I tell you what it is if you interfere in this
matter I'll be hanged if I don't blow your brains out

And you'll be hanged if you do said Jack as he walked out of the
room so it's all one either way old fizgig

What roared the admiral as he sprang up and ran after Jack Have I
lived all these years to be called names in my own ship I mean my own
house What does the infernal rascal mean by it

The admiral no doubt would have pursued Jack very closely had not
Flora intercepted him and by gentle violence got him back to the
room No one else could have ventured to have stopped him but the
affection he had for her was so great that she could really accomplish
almost anything with him and by listening quietly to his complaints of
Jack Pringle which however involved a disclosure of the fact which he
had intended to keep to himself that he had sought the lawyer's
advice she succeeded in soothing him completely so that he forgot his
anger in a very short time

But the old man's anger although easily aroused never lasted very
long and upon the whole it was really astonishing what he put up with
from Jack Pringle in the way of taunts and sneers of all sorts and
descriptions and now and then not a little real abuse

And probably he thought likewise that Jack Pringle did not mean what
he said on the same principle that he the admiral when he called
Jack a mutinous swab and a marine certainly did not mean that Jack was
those things but merely used them as expletives to express a great
amount of indignation at the moment because as may be well supposed
nothing in the world could be worse in Admiral Bell's estimation that
to be a mutinous swab or a marine

It was rather a wonder though that in his anger some day he did not
do Jack some mischief for as we have had occasion to notice in one or
two cases the admiral was not extremely particular as to what sorts of
missiles he used when he considered it necessary to throw something at
Jack's head

It would not have been a surprising thing if Jack had really made some
communication to the lawyer but he did stop short at that amount of
pleasantry and as he himself expressed it for once in a way he let
the old man please himself

The admiral soon forgot this little dispute and then pleased himself
with the idea that he should pass a pleasant day with the attorney

Ah well he said who would have thought that ever I should have
gone and taken dinner with a lawyer and not only done that but invited
myself too It shows us all that there may be some good in all sorts of
men lawyers included and I am sure after this I ought to begin to
think what I never thought before and that is that a marine may
actually be a useful person It shows that as one gets older one gets
wiser

Illustration

It was an immense piece of liberality for a man brought up as Admiral
Bell had been in decidedly one of the most prejudiced branches of the
public service to make any such admissions as these A very great thing
it was and showed a liberality of mind such as even at the present
time is not readily found

It is astonishing as well as amusing to find how the mind assimilates
itself to the circumstances in which it is placed and how society
being cut up into small sections imagines different things merely as a
consequence of their peculiar application We shall find that even
people living at different ends of a city will look with a sort of
pity and contempt upon each other and it is much to be regretted that
public writers are found who use what little ability they may possess in
pandering to their feelings

It was as contemptible and silly as it was reprehensible for a late
celebrated novelist to pretend that he believed there was at place
called Bloomsbury-square but he really did not know because that was
merely done for the purpose of raising a silly laugh among persons who
were neither respectable on account of their abilities or their conduct

But to return from this digression The admiral attired in his best
suit which always consisted of a blue coat the exact colour of the
navy uniform an immense pale primrose coloured waistcoat and white
kerseymere continuations went to the lawyer's as had been arranged

If anything at all could flatter the old man's vanity successfully it
certainly would be the manner in which he was received at the lawyer's
house where everything was done that could give him satisfaction

A very handsome repast was laid before him and when the cloth was
removed the admiral broached the subject upon which he wished to ask
the advice of his professional friend After telling him of the wedding
that was to come off he said 

Now I have bargained to invite twenty people and of course as that
is exclusive of any of the family and as I don't know any people about
this neighbourhood except yourself I want you and your family to come
to start with and then I want you to find me out some more decent
people to make up the party

I feel highly flattered said the attorney that in such a case as
this you should have come to me and my only great fear is that I
should not be able to give you satisfaction

Oh you needn't be afraid of that there is no fear on that head so I
shall leave it all to you to invite the folks that you think proper

I will endeavour certainly admiral to do my best Of course living
in the town as I have for many years I know some very nice people as
well as some very queer ones

Oh we don't want any of the queer ones but let those who are invited
be frank hearty good-tempered people such as one will be glad to meet
over and over again without any ceremony none of your simpering people
who are afraid to laugh for fear of opening their mouths too wide but
who are so mighty genteel that they are afraid to enjoy anything for
fear it should be vulgar

I understand you admiral perfectly and shall endeavour to obey your
instructions to the very letter but if I should unfortunately invite
anybody you don't like you must excuse me for making such a mistake

Oh of course of course Never mind that and if any disagreeable
fellow comes we will smother him in some way

It would serve him right for no one ought to make himself
disagreeable after being honoured with an invitation from you but I
will be most especially careful and I hope that such a circumstance
will not occur

Never mind If it should I'll tell you what I'll do I'll set Jack
Pringle upon him and if he don't worry his life out it will be a
strange thing to me

Oh said the lawyer I am glad you have mentioned him for it gives
me an opportunity of saying that I have done all in my power to make him
comfortable

All in your power to make him comfortable What do you mean

I mean that I have placed such a dinner before him as will please him
I told him to ask for just whatever he likes

The admiral looked at the lawyer with amazement for a few moments in
silence and then he said

D n it why you don't mean to tell me that that rascal is here

Oh yes he came about ten minutes I before you arrived and said you
were coming and he has been down stairs feasting all the while since

Stop a bit Do you happen to have any loaded fire arms in the house

We have got an old bunderbuss but what for admiral

To shoot that scoundrel Pringle I'll blow his brains out as sure as
fate The impudence of his coming here directly against my orders
too

My dear sir calm yourself and think nothing of it it's of no
consequence whatever

No consequence where is that blunderbuss of yours Do you mean to tell
me that mutiny is of no consequence Give me the blunderbuss

But my clear sir we only keep it in terrorem and have no bullets

Never mind that we can cram in a handful of nails or brass buttons
or hammer up a few halfpence anything of that sort will do to settle
his business with

How do you get on old Tarbarrel said Jack putting his head in at
the door Are you making yourself comfortable I'll be hanged if I
don't think you have a drop too much already you look so precious red
about the gills I have been getting on famous and I thought I'd just
hop up for a minute to make your mind easy about me and tell you so

It was quite evident that Jack had done justice to the good cheer of the
lawyer for he was rather unsteady and had to hold by the door-post to
support himself while there was such a look of contentment upon his
countenance as contrasted with the indignation that was manifest upon
the admiral's face that as the saying is it would have made a cat
laugh to see them

Be off with ye Jack said the lawyer be off with ye Go down stairs
again and enjoy yourself Don't you see that the admiral is angry with
you

Oh he be bothered said Jack I'll soon settle him if he comes any
of his nonsense and mind Mr Lawyer whatever you do don't you give
him too much to drink

The lawyer ran to the door and pushed Jack out for he rightly enough
suspected that the quietness of the admiral was only that calm which
precedes a storm of more than usual amount and magnitude so he was
anxious to part them at once

He then set about appeasing as well as he could the admiral's anger
by attributing the perseverance of Jack in following him wherever he
went to his great affection for him which combined with his
ignorance might make him often troublesome when he had really no
intention of being so

This was certainly the best way of appeasing the old man and indeed
the only way in which it could be done successfully and the proof that
it was so consisted in the fact that the admiral did consent at the
suggestion of the attorney to forgive Jack once more for the offence he
had committed




 XCVI

THE BARON TAKES ANDERBURY HOUSE AND DECIDES UPON GIVING A GRAND
ENTERTAINMENT


Illustration

It was not considered anything extraordinary that although the Baron
Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh went out with the mysterious stranger who had
arrived at the Anderbury Arms to see him he should return without him
for certainly he was not bound to bring him back by any means whatever

Moreover he entered the inn so quietly and with such an appearance of
perfect composure that no one could have suspected for a moment that he
had been guilty really of the terrific crime which had been laid to his
charge a crime which few men could have committed in so entirely
unmoved and passionless a manner as he had done it

But he seemed to consider the taking of a human life as a thing not of
the remotest consequence and not to be considered at all as a matter
which was to put any one out of the way but as a thing to be done when
necessity required with all the ease in the world without arousing or
awaking any of those feelings of remorse which one would suppose ought
to find a place in the heart of a man who had been guilty of such
monstrous behaviour

He walked up to his own apartment again and retired to rest with the
same feeling apparently of calmness and the same ability to taste of
the sweets of repose as had before characterized him

The stranger's horse which was a valuable and beautiful animal
remained in the stable of the inn and as of course that was
considered a guarantee for his return the landlord when he himself
retired to rest left one of his establishment sitting up to let in the
man who now lay so motionless and so frightful in appearance in one of
the ice-wells of the mysterious passage leading from the base of the
cliff to the grounds of Anderbury House

But the night wore on and the man who had been left to let the stranger
in after making many efforts to keep himself awake dropped into sound
repose which he might just as well have done in the first instance
inasmuch as although he knew it not he was engaged in the vain task of
waiting for the dead

The morning was fresh and beautiful and at a far earlier hour than a
person of his quality was expected to make his appearance the baron
descended from his chamber for somehow or other by common consent it
seems to be agreed that great personages must be late in rising and
equally late in going to bed

But the baron was evidently not so disposed to turn night into day and
the landlord congratulated himself not a little upon the fact that he
was ready for his illustrious guest when he descended so unexpectedly
from his chamber as he did

An ample breakfast was disposed of that is to say it was placed upon
the table and charged to the baron who selected from it what he
pleased and when the meal was over the landlord ventured to enter the
apartment and said to him with all due humility 

If you please sir Mr Leek who has the letting of
Anderbury-on-the-Mount that is Anderbury House as it is usually
called is here sir and would be happy to take your orders as to when
you would be pleased to look at those premises

I shall be ready to go in half a hour said the baron and as the
distance is not great I will walk from here to the mansion

This message was duly communicated to Mr Leek who thereupon determined
upon waiting until the baron should announce his readiness to depart
upon the expedition and he was as good as his word for in about
half-an-hour afterwards he descended to the hall and then Mr Leek was
summoned who came out of the bar with such a grand rush that he fell
over a mat that was before him and saluted the baron by digging his
head into his stomach and then falling sprawling at his feet and
laying hold of his ankle

This little incident was duly apologised for and explained after which
Mr Leek walked on through the town towards Anderbury-on-the-Mount
followed by the illustrious personage whom he sincerely hoped he should
be able to induce to take it

It was a curious thing to see how they traversed the streets together
for while the baron walked right on and with a solemn and measured
step Mr Leek managed to get along a few paces in front of him
sideways so that he could keep up a sort of conversation upon the
merits of Anderbury House and the neighbourhood in general without
much effort to which remarks the baron made such suitable and dignified
replies as a baron would be supposed to make

You will find sir said Mr Leek that everything about Anderbury is
extremely select and amazingly correct and I am sure a more delightful
place to live in could not be found

Ah said the baron very likely

It's lively too continued Mr Leek very lively and there are two
chapels of ease besides the church

That's a drawback said the baron

A drawback sir well I am sorry I mentioned it but perhaps you are a
Roman Catholic sir and in that case the chapels of ease have no
interest for you

Not the slightest but do not sir run away with any assumption
concerning my religious opinions for I am not a Roman Catholic

No sir no sir nor more am I and as far as I think and my opinion
goes I say why shouldn't a gentleman with a large fortune be what he
likes or nothing if he likes that better but here we are sir close
to one of the entrances of Anderbury House There are three principal
entrances you understand sir on three sides of the estate and the
fourth side faces the sea where there is that mysterious passage that
leads down from the grounds to the beach which perhaps you have heard
of sir

The landlord of the inn mentioned it

We consider it a great curiosity sir I can assure you in these
parts a very great curiosity and it's an immense advantage to the
house because you see sir in extremely hot weather all sorts of
provisions can be taken down there and kept at such a very low
temperature as to be quite delightful

That is an advantage

Mr Leek rang the bell that hung over one of the entrances and his
summons for admission was speedily answered by the old couple who had
charge of the premises and then with a view of impressing them with a
notion of the importance of the personage whom he had brought to look at
the place he said aloud 

The Baron Stoltmayor of Saltsomething has come to look at the
premises

This announcement was received with all due deference and respect and
the task of showing the baron the premises at once fairly commenced

Here you have said Mr Leek assuming an oratorical attitude here
you have the umbrageous trees stooping down to dip their leaves in the
purling waters here you have the sweet foliage lending a delicious
perfume to the balmy air here you have the murmuring waterfalls playing
music of the spheres to the listening birds who sit responsive upon the
dancing boughs here you have all the fragrance of the briny ocean
mingling with the scent of a bank of violets and wrapping the senses in
Elysium here you may never tire of an existence that presents
never-ending charms and that in the full enjoyment of which you may
live far beyond the allotted span of man

Enough enough said the baron

Here you have the choicest exotics taking kindly to a soil gifted by
nature with the most extraordinary powers of production and all that
can pamper the appetite or yield delight to the senses is scattered
around by nature with a liberal hand It is quite impossible that
royalty should come near the favoured spot without visiting it as a
thing of course and I forgot to mention that a revenue is derived from
some cottages which although small is yet sufficient to pay the tithe
on the whole estate

There there that will do

Here you have purling rills and cascades and fish-ponds so redundant
with the finny tribe that you have but to wish for sport and it is
yours here you have in the mansion chambers that vie with the
accommodation of a palace ample dormitories and halls of ancient
grandeur here you have 

Stop said the baron stop I cannot be pestered in this way with
your description I have no patience to listen to such mere words show
me the house at once and let me judge for myself

Certainly sir oh certainly only I thought it right to give you a
slight description of the place as it really was and now sir that we
have reached the house I may remark that here we have 

Silence said the baron if you begin with here we have I know not
when you will leave off All I require of you is to show me the place
and to answer any question which I may put to you concerning it I will
draw my own conclusions and nothing you can say one way or another
will affect my imagination

Certainly sir certainly I shall only be too happy to answer any
questions that may be put to me by a person of your lordship's great
intelligence and all I can remark is that when you reach the
drawing-room floor any person may truly say here you have I really
beg your pardon sir I had not the slightest intention of saying here
you have I assure you but the words came out quite unawares I assure
you

Peace peace cried again the baron you disturb me by this incessant
clatter

Thus admonished Mr Leek was now quiet and allowed the baron in his
own way to make what investigation he pleased concerning Anderbury
House

The investigation was not one that could be gone over in ten minutes
for the house was extremely extensive and the estate altogether
presented so many features of beauty and interest that it was
impossible not to linger over it for a considerable period of time

The grounds were most extensive and planted with such a regard to order
and regularity everything being in its proper place that it was a
pleasure to see an estate so well kept And although the baron was not a
man who said much it was quite evident by what little he did utter
that he was very well pleased with Anderbury-on-the-Mount

And now said Mr Leek I will do myself the pleasure sir of
showing your grace the subterranean passage

At this moment a loud ring at one of the entrance gates was heard and
upon the man who had charge of the house answering the summons for
admission he found that it was a gentleman who gave a card on which
was the name of Sir John Westlake and who desired to see the premises

Sir John Westlake said Mr Leek oh I recollect he did call at my
office and say that he thought of taking Anderbury-on-the-Mount A
gentleman of great and taste is Sir John but I must tell him baron
that you have the preference if you choose to embrace it

At this moment the stranger advanced and when he saw the baron he
bowed courteously upon which Mr Leek said 

I regret Sir John that if you should take a fancy to the place I am
compelled first of all to give this gentleman the refusal of it

Certainly said Sir John Westlake do not let me interfere with any
one I have nearly made up my mind and came to look over the property
again but of course if this gentleman is beforehand with me I must be
content I wish particularly to go down to the subterranean passage to
the beach if it is not too much trouble

Trouble certainly not sir Here Davis get some links and we can go
at once and as this gentleman likewise has seen everything but that
strange excavation he will probably descend with us

Certainly said the baron I shall have great pleasure and he said
it with so free and unembarrassed an air that no one could have
believed for a moment in the possibility that such a subject of fearful
interest to him was there to be found

The entrance from the grounds into this deep cavernous place was in a
small but neat building that looked like a summer-house and now
torches being procured and one lit a door was opened which conducted
at once into the commencement of the excavation and Mr Leek heading
the way the distinguished party as that gentleman loved afterwards to
call it in his accounts of the transaction proceeded into the very
bowels of the earth as it were and quickly lost all traces of the
daylight

The place did not descend by steps but by a gentle slope which it
required some caution to traverse because being cut in the chalk
which in some places was worn very smooth it was extremely slippery
but this was a difficulty that a little practice soon overcame and as
they went on the place became more interesting every minute

Even the baron allowed Mr Leek to make a speech upon the occasion and
that gentleman said 

You will perceive that this excavation must have been made at a great
expense out of the solid cliff and in making it some of the most
curious specimens of petrifaction and fossil remains were found You see
that the roof is vaulted and that it is only now and then a lump of
chalk has fallen in or a great piece of flint and now we come to one
of the ice-wells

They came to a deep excavation down which they looked and when the man
held the torch beneath its surface they could dimly see the bottom of
it where there was a number of large pieces of flint stone and
apparently likewise the remains of broken bottles

There used to be a windlass at the top of this said Mr Leek and
the things were let down in a basket They do say that ice will keep for
two years in one of these places

And are there more of these excavations said the baron

Oh dear yes sir there are five or six of them for different
purposes for when the family that used to live in Anderbury House had
grand entertainments which they sometimes had in the summer season
they always had a lot of men down here cooling wines and passing them
up from hand to hand to the house

From the gradual slope of this passage down to the cliffs and the
zigzag character of it it may be well supposed that it was of
considerable extent Indeed Mr Leek asserted that it was half a mile
in actual measured length

The baron was not at all anxious to run any risk of a discovery of the
dead body which he had cast into that ice-well which was nearest to the
opening on to the beach so as he went on he negatived the different
proposals that were made to look down into the excavations and
succeeded in putting a stop to that species of inquiry in the majority
of instances but he could not wholly do so

Perhaps it would have been better for his purpose if he had encouraged a
look into every one of the ice-wells for in that case their
similarity of appearance might have tired out Sir John Westlake before
they got to the last one but as it was when they reached the one down
which the body had been precipitated he had the mortification to hear
Mr Leek say 

And now Sir John and you my lord baron as we have looked at the
first of these ice wells and at none of the others suppose we look at
the last

The baron was afraid to say anything because if the body were
discovered and identified as that of the visitor at the inn and who
had been seen last with him any reluctance on his part to have that
ice-well examined might easily afterwards be construed into a very
powerful piece of circumstantial evidence against him

He therefore merely bowed his assent thinking that the examination
would be but a superficial one and that in consequence he should
escape easily from any disagreeable consequences

But this the fates ordained otherwise and there seemed no hope of that
ice-well in particular escaping such an investigation as was sure to
induce some uncomfortable results

Davis said Mr Leek these places are not deep you see and I was
thinking that if you went down one of them it would be as well for
then you would be able to tell the gentlemen what the bottom was fairly
composed of you understand

Oh I don't mind sir said Davis I have been down one of them
before to-day I can tell you sir

I do not see the necessity said Sir John Westlake exactly of such
a thing but still if you please and this gentleman wishes 

I have no wish upon the occasion said the baron and like yourself
cannot see the necessity

Oh there is no trouble said Mr Leek and it's better now you are
here that you see and understand all about it How can you get down
Davis

Why sir it ain't above fourteen feet altogether so I sha'n't have
any difficulty for I can hang by my hands about half the distance and
drop the remainder

As he spoke he took off his coat and then stuck the link he carried
into a cleft of the rock that was beside the brink of the excavation

The baron now saw that there would be no such thing as avoiding a
discovery of the fact of the dead body being in that place and his only
hope was that in its descent it might have become so injured as to defy
identification

But this was a faint hope because he recollected that he had himself
seen the face which was turned upwards and the period after death was
by far too short for him to have any hope that decomposition could have
taken place even to the most limited extent

The light which was stuck in a niche shed but a few inefficient rays
down into the pit and as the baron stood with folded arms looking
calmly on he expected each moment a scene of surprise and terror would
ensue

Nor was he wrong for scarcely had the man plunged down into that deep
place than he uttered a cry of alarm and terror and shouted 

Murder murder Lift me out There is a dead man down here and I have
jumped upon him

A dead man cried Mr Leek and Sir John Westlake in a breath

How very strange said the baron

Lend me a hand cried Davis lend me a hand out I cannot stand this
you know Lend me a hand out I say at once

This was easier to speak of than to do and Mr Davis began to discover
that it was easier by far to get into a deep pit than to get out of
one notwithstanding that his assertion of having been down into those
places was perfectly true but then he had met with nothing alarming
and had been able perfectly at his leisure to scramble out the best way
he could

Now however his frantic efforts to release himself from a much more
uncomfortable situation than he had imagined it possible for him to get
into were of so frantic a nature that he only half buried himself in
pieces of chalk which he kept pulling down with vehemence from the
sides of the pit and succeeded in accomplishing nothing towards his
rescue

Oh the fellow is only joking said the baron and amusing himself at
our expense

But the manner in which the man cried for help and the marked terror
which was in every tone was quite sufficient to prove that he was not
acting for if he were a more accomplished mimic could not have been
found on the stage than he was

This is serious said Sir John Westlake and cannot be allowed Have
you any ropes here by which we can assist him from the pit Don't be
alarmed my man for if there be a dead body in the pit it can't harm
you Take your time quietly and easily and you will assuredly get out

Aye said the baron the more haste the worst speed is an English
proverb and in this case it will be fully exemplified This man would
easily leave the pit if he would have the patience with care and
quietness to clamber up its sides

It would appear that Davis felt the truth of these exhortations for
although he trembled excessively he did begin to make some progress in
his ascent and get so high that Mr Leek was enabled to get hold of
his hand and give him a little assistance so that in another minute
or so he was rescued from his situation which was not one of peril
although it was certainly one of fright

He trembled so excessively and stuttered and stammered that for some
minutes no one could understand very well what he said but at length
upon making himself intelligible he exclaimed 

There has been a murder there has been a murder committed and the
body thrown into the ice pit I felt that I jumped down upon something
soft and when I put down my hand to feel what it was it came across a
dead man's face and then of course I called out

You certainly did call out

Yes and so would anybody I think under such circumstances I suppose
I shall be hung now because I had charge of the house

That did not strike me until this moment said the baron but if
there be a dead body in that pit it certainly places this man in a very
awkward position

What the deuce do you mean said Davis I don't know no more about it
than the child unborn There is a dead man in the ice-well and that is
all I know about it but whether he has been there a long time or a
short time I don't know any more than the moon so it's no use
bothering me about it

My good man said the baron it would be very wrong indeed to impute
to you any amount of criminality in this business since you may be
entirely innocent and I for one believe that you are so for I cannot
think that any guilty man would venture into the place where he had put
the body of his victim in the way that you ventured into that pit I
say I cannot believe it possible and therefore I think you innocent
and will take care to see that no injustice is done you but at the same
time I cannot help adding that I think of course you will find
yourself suspected in some way

I am very much obliged to you sir said Davis but as I happen to be
quite innocent I am very easy about it and don't care one straw what
people say I have not been in this excavation for Heaven knows how
long

But what's to be done said Mr Leek I suppose it's our duty to do
something under such circumstances

Unquestionably said the baron and the first thing to be done is to
inform the police of what has happened so that the body may be got up
and as I have now seen enough of the estate to satisfy me as regards its
capabilities I decide at once upon taking it if I can agree upon the
conditions of the tenancy and I will purchase it if the price be such
as I think suitable

Well said Mr Leek if anything could reconcile me to the
extraordinary circumstance that has just occurred it certainly is
baron the having so desirable a tenant for Anderbury-on-the-Mount as
yourself But we need not traverse all this passage again for it is
much nearer now to get out upon the sea-coast at once as we are so
close to the other opening upon the beach It seems to me that we ought
to proceed at once to the town and give information to the authorities
of the discovery which we have made

It is absolutely necessary said the baron so to do so come along
at once I shall proceed to my inn and as of course I have seen
nothing more than yourselves and consequently could only repeat your
evidence I do not see that my presence is called for Nevertheless of
course if the justices think it absolutely necessary that I should
appear I can have no possible objection to so do

This was as straightforward as anything that could be desired and
moreover it was rather artfully put together for it seemed to imply
that he Mr Leek would be slighted if his evidence was not considered
sufficient

Of course said Mr Leek I don't see at all why as you sir have
only the same thing to say as myself I should not be sufficient

Don't call upon me on any account said Sir John Westlake

Oh no no cried Mr Leek there is no occasion I won't you may
depend if it can be helped

Sir John in rather a nervous and excited manner bade them good day
before they got quite into the town and hurried off while the baron
with a dignified bow when he reached the door of his hotel said to Mr
Leek 

Of course I do not like the trouble of judicial investigations more
than anybody else and therefore unless it is imperatively necessary
that I should appear I shall take it as a favour to be released from
such a trouble

My lord baron said Mr Leek you may depend that I shall mention
that to the magistrates and the coroner and all those sort of people
and then Mr Leek walked away but he muttered to himself as he did so
They will have him as sure as fate just because he is a baron and
his name will look well in the County Chronicle'

Mr Leek then repaired immediately to the house of one of the principal
magistrates and related what had occurred to the great surprise of
that gentleman who suggested immediately the propriety of making the
fact known to the coroner of the district as it was more his business
than a magistrate's in the first instance since nobody was accused of
the offence

This suggestion was immediately followed and that functionary directed
that the body should be removed from where it was to the nearest
public-house and immediately issued his precept for an inquiry into the
case

By this time the matter had begun to get bruited about in the town and
of course it went from mouth to mouth with many exaggerations and
although it by no means did follow that a murder had been committed
because a dead body had been found yet such was the universal
impression and the matter began to be talked about as the murder in the
subterranean passage leading to Anderbury House with all the gusto
which the full particulars of some deed of blood was calculated to
inspire And how it spread about was thus 

The fact was that Mr Leek was so anxious to let Anderbury-on-the-Mount
to the rich Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh that he got a friend of his
to come and personate Sir John Westlake while he the baron was
looking at the premises in order to drive him at once to a conclusion
upon the matter so that what made Sir John so very anxious that he
should not be called forward in the matter consisted in the simple fact
that he was nothing else than plain Mr Brown who kept a hatter's shop
in the town but he could not keep his own counsel and instead of
holding his tongue as he ought to have done about the matter he told
it to every one he met so that in a short time it was generally known
that something serious and startling had occurred in the subterranean
passage to Anderbury House and a great mob of persons thronged the
beach in anxious expectation of getting more information on the matter

The men likewise who had been ordered by the coroner to remove the
body soon reached the spot and they gave an increased impetus to the
proceedings by opening the door of the subterranean passage and then
looking earnestly along the beach as if in expectation of something or
somebody of importance

When eagerly questioned by the mob for the throng of persons now
assembled quite amounted to a mob to know what they waited for one of
them said 

A coffin was to have been brought down to take the body in

This announcement at once removed anything doubtful that might be in the
minds of any of them upon the subject and at once proclaimed the fact
not only that there was a dead body but that if they looked out they
would see it forthwith

The throng thickened and by the time two men were observed approaching
with a coffin on their shoulders there was scarcely anybody left in the
town except a few rare persons indeed who were not so curious as
their neighbours

It was not an agreeable job even to those men who were not the most
particular in the world to be removing so loathsome a spectacle as that
which they were pretty sure to encounter in the ice-well but they did
not shrink from it and by setting about it as a duty they got through
it tolerably well

They took with them several large torches and then one having
descended into the pit fastened a rope under the arms of the dead man
and so he was hauled out and placed in the shell that was ready to
receive him

They were all surprised at the fresh and almost healthful appearance of
the countenance and it was quite evident to everybody that if any one
had known him in life they could not have the least possible difficulty
in recognising him now that he was no more

And the only appearance of injury which he exhibited was in that
dreadful wound which had certainly proved his death and which was
observable in his throat the moment they looked upon him

Illustration

The crush to obtain a sight of the body was tremendous at the moment it
was brought out and a vast concourse of persons followed it in
procession to the town where the greatest excitement prevailed It was
easily discovered that no known person was missing and some who had
caught a sight of the body went so far as to assert that it must have
been in the ice-well for years and that the extreme cold had preserved
it in all its original freshness

The news of course came round although not through the baron for he
did not condescend to say one word about it at the inn and it was the
landlord who first started the suggestion of What suppose it is the
gentleman who left his horse here

This idea had no sooner got possession of his brain than it each moment
seemed to him to assume a more reasonable and tangible form and without
saying any more to any one else about it he at once started off to
where the body lay awaiting an inquest to see if his suspicions were
correct

When he arrived at the public-house and asked to see the body he was at
once permitted to do so for the landlord knew him and was as curious
as he could be upon the subject by any possibility One glance of
course was sufficient and the landlord at once said 

Yes I have seen him before though I don't know his name He came to
my house last night and left his horse there and although I only saw
him for a moment as he passed through the hall I am certain I am not
mistaken I dare say all my waiters will recognise him as well as the
Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh who is staying with me and who no doubt
knows very well who he is for he went out with him late and came home
alone and I ordered one of my men to wait up all night in order to let
in this very person who is now lying dead before us

The deuce you did But you don't suppose the baron murdered him do
you

It's a mystery to me altogether quite a profound mystery It's very
unlikely certainly and what's the most extraordinary part of the whole
affair is how the deuce could he come into one of the ice-wells
belonging to Anderbury House That's what puzzles me altogether

Well it will all come out I hope at the inquest which is to be held
at four o'clock to day There must have been foul play somewhere but
the mystery is where and that Heaven only knows perhaps

I shall attend said the landlord of course to identify him and I
suppose unless anybody claims the horse I may as well keep possession
of it

Don't you flatter yourself that you will get the horse out of the
transaction Don't you know quite well that the government takes
possession of everything as don't belong to nobody

Yes but I have got him and possession you know is nine points of
the law

It may be so but their tenth point will get the better of you for all
that You take my word for it the horse will be claimed of you but I
don't mind as an old acquaintance putting you up to a dodge

In what way

Why I'll tell you what happened with a friend of mine but don't think
it was me for if it was I would tell you at once so don't think it He
kept a country public-house and one day an elderly gentleman came in
and appeared to be unwell He just uttered a word or two and then
dropped down dead He happened to have in his fob a gold repeater that
was worth at least a hundred guineas and my friend before anybody
came took it out and popped in in its stead an old watch that he
had which was not worth a couple of pounds

It was running a risk

It was but it turned out very well because the old gentleman happened
to be a very eccentric person and was living alone so that his friends
really did not know what he had or what he had not but took it for
granted that any watch produced belonged to him So if I were you in
this case when the gentleman's horse is claimed I'd get the d dest
old screw I could and let them have that

You would

Indeed would I and glory in it too as the very best thing that could
be done Now a horse is of use to you

I believe ye it is

Exactly but what's the use of it to government and what's more if
it went to the government there might be some excuse but the
government will know no more about it and make not so much as I shall
Some Jack-in-office will lay hold of it as a thing of course and a
perquisite when you might just as well and a great deal better too
keep it yourself for it would do you some good as you say and none to
them

I'll do it it is a good and a happy thought There is no reason on
earth why I shouldn't do it and I will I have made up my mind to it
now

Well I am glad you have What do you think now the dead man's horse is
worth

Oh fifty or sixty guineas value

Then very good Then when the affair is all settled I will trouble
you for twenty pounds

You

Yes to be sure Who else do you suppose is going to interfere with
you One is enough ain't it at a time and I think after giving you
such advice as I have that I am entitled at all events to something

I tell you what said the landlord of the hotel taking all things
into consideration I have altered my mind rather and won't do it

Very good You need not only mind if you do I am down upon you like
a shot

The excitement contingent upon the inquest was very great indeed the
large room in the public-house where it was held was crowded to
suffocation with persons who were anxious to be present at the
proceedings When the landlord reached home of course he told his
guest the baron of the discovery he had made that the murdered man
was the strange visitor of the previous night for now from the
frightful wound he had received in his throat the belief that he was
murdered became too rational a one to admit of any doubts and was that
which was universally adopted in preference to any other suggestion upon
the occasion although no doubt people would be found who would not
scruple to aver that he had cut his own throat after making his way
into the well belonging to Anderbury House

The landlord had his own misgivings concerning his guest the baron now
that something had occurred of such an awful and mysterious a nature to
one who was evidently known to him It did not seem to be a pleasant
thing to have such an intimate friend of a man who had been murdered in
one's house especially when it came to be considered that he was the
last person seen in his company and that consequently he was
peculiarly called upon to give an explanation of how and under what
circumstances he had parted with him

The baron was sitting smoking in the most unconcerned manner in the
world when the landlord came to bring him this intelligence and when
he had heard him to an end the remark he made was 

Really you very much surprise me but perhaps as you are better
acquainted with the town than I am you can tell me who he was

Why sir that is what we hoped you would be able to tell us

How should I tell you He introduced himself to me as a Mr Mitchell a
surveyor and he said that hearing I talked of purchasing or renting
Anderbury-on-the-Mount he came to tell me that the principal side wall
that you could see from the beach was off the perpendicular

Indeed sir

Yes and as this was a very interesting circumstance to me considering
that I really did contemplate such a purchase or renting and do so
still as it was a moonlight night and he said he could show me in a
minute what he meant if I would accompany him I did so but when we got
there and on the road I heard quite enough of him to convince me that
he was a little out of his senses and consequently I paid no more
attention to what he said but walked home and left him on the beach

It's a most extraordinary circumstance sir there is no such person I
assure you as Mitchell a surveyor in the town so I can't make it out
in the least

But I tell you I consider the man out of his senses and perhaps that
may account for the whole affair

Oh yes sir that would certainly but still it's a very odd thing
because we don't know of such a person at all and it does seem so
extraordinary that he should have made his appearance all of a sudden
in this sort of way I suppose sir that you will attend the inquest
now that's to be held upon him

Oh yes I have no objection whatever to that indeed I feel myself
bound to do so because I suppose mine is the latest evidence that can
be at all produced concerning him

Unquestionably sir our coroner is a very clever man and you will be
glad to know him very glad to know him sir and he will be glad to
know you so I am sure it will be a mutual gratification It's at four
o'clock the inquest is to be and I dare say sir if you are there by
half-past it will be time enough

No doubt of that but I will be punctual

We have already said the room in which the inquest was to be held was
crowded almost to suffocation and not only was that the case but the
lower part of the house was crammed with people likewise and there can
be very little doubt but the baron would have shrunk from such an
investigation from a number of curious eyes if he could have done so
while the landlord of the house would have had no objection as far as
his profit was concerned in the sale of a great quantity of beer and
spirits to have had such an occurrence every day in the week if
possible

The body lay still in the shell where it had been originally placed
After it had been viewed by the jury and almost every one had remarked
upon the extraordinary fresh appearance it wore they proceeded at once
to the inquiry and the first witness who appeared was Mr Leek who
deposed to have been in company with some gentlemen viewing Anderbury
House and to have found the body in one of the ice-wells of that
establishment

This evidence was corroborated by that of Davis who had so unexpectedly
jumped into the well without being aware that it contained already so
disagreeable a visitor as it did in the person of the murdered man
regarding the cause of whose death the present inquiry was instituted

Then the landlord identified the body as that of a gentleman who had
come to his house on horseback and who had afterwards walked out with
Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh who was one of his guests

Is that gentleman in attendance said the coroner

Yes sir he is I told him about it and he has kindly come forward to
give all the evidence in his power concerning it

There was a general expression of interest and curiosity when the baron
stepped forward attired in his magnificent coat trimmed with fur and
tendered his evidence to the coroner which of course was precisely
the same as the statement he had made to the landlord of the house for
as he had made up such a well connected story he was not likely to
prevaricate or to depart from it in the smallest particular

He was listened to with breathless attention and when he had
concluded the coroner with a preparatory hem said to him

And you have reason to suppose sir that this person was out of his
senses

It seemed to me so he talked wildly and incoherently and in such a
manner as to fully induce such a belief

You left him on the beach

I did I found when I got there that it was only a very small portion
indeed of Anderbury House that was visible and although the moon
shone brightly I must confess I did not see myself any signs of
deviation from the perpendicular and such being the case I left the
spot at once because I could have no further motive in staying and
moreover it was not pleasant to be out at night with a man whom I
thought was deranged I regretted after making this discovery that I
had come from home on such a fool's errand but as when one is going to
invest a considerable sum of money in any enterprise one is naturally
anxious to know all about it I went little suspecting that the man was
insane

Did you see him after that

Certainly not until to-day when I recognised in the body that has
been exhibited to me the same individual

Gentlemen said the coroner to the jury it appears to me that this
is a most mysterious affair the deceased person has a wound in his
throat which I have no doubt you will hear from a medical witness has
been the cause of death and the most singular part of the affair is
how if he inflicted it upon himself he has managed to dispose of the
weapon with which he did the deed

The last person seen in his company said one of the jury was the
baron and I think he is bound to give some better explanation of the
affair

I am yet to discover said the baron that the last person who
acknowledges to having been in the company of a man afterwards murdered
must of necessity be the murderer

Yes but how do you account sir for there being no weapon found by
which the man could have done the deed himself

I don't account for it at all how do you

This is irregular said the coroner call the next witness

This was a medical man who briefly stated that he had seen the
deceased and that the wound in his throat was amply sufficient to
account for his death that it was inflicted with a sharp instrument
having an edge on each side

This then seemed to conclude the case and the coroner remarked 

Gentlemen of the jury I think this is one of those peculiar cases in
which an open verdict is necessary or else an adjournment without date
so that the matter can be resumed at any time if fresh evidence can be
procured concerning it There is no one accused of the offence although
it appears to me impossible that the unhappy man could have committed
the act himself We have no reason to throw the least shade of suspicion
or doubt upon the evidence of the Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh for as
far as we know anything of the matter the murdered man may have been in
the company of a dozen people after the baron left him

A desultory conversation ensued which ended in an adjournment of the
inquest without any future day being mentioned for its re-assembling
and so the Baron Stolmuyer entirely escaped from what might have been a
very serious affair to him

It did not however appear to shake him in his resolution of taking
Anderbury-on-the-Mount although Mr Leek very much feared it would but
he announced to that gentleman his intention fully of doing so and told
him to get the necessary papers drawn up forthwith

I hope he said within a few weeks time to be fairly installed in
that mansion and then I will trouble you Mr Leek to give me a list
of the names of all the best families in the neighbourhood for I intend
giving an entertainment on a grand scale in the mansion and grounds

Sir said Mr Leek I shall with the greatest pleasure attend upon
you in every possible way in this affair This is a very excellent
neighbourhood and you will have no difficulty I assure you sir in
getting together an extremely capital and creditable assemblage of
persons There could not be a better plan devised for at once
introducing all the people who are worth knowing to you

I thank you said the baron I think the place will suit me well
and as the Baroness Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh is dead I have some idea
of marrying again and therefore it becomes necessary and desirable that
I should be well acquainted with the surrounding families of distinction
in this neighbourhood

This was a hint not at all likely to be thrown away upon Mr Leek who
was the grand gossip-monger of the place and he treasured it up in
order to see if he could not make something of it which would be
advantageous to himself

He knew quite enough of the select and fashionable families in that
neighbourhood to be fully aware that neither the baron's age nor his
ugliness would be any bar to his forming a matrimonial alliance

There is not one of them he said to himself who would not marry the
very devil himself and be called the Countess Lucifer or any name of
the kind always provided there was plenty of money and that the baron
has without doubt so it is equally without doubt he may pick and choose
where he pleases

This was quite correct of Mr Leek and showed his great knowledge of
human nature and we entertain with him a candid opinion that if the
Baron Stolmuyer of Saltzburgh had been ten times as ugly as he was and
Heaven knows that was needless he might pick and choose a wife almost
when he pleased

This is a general rule and as of course to all general rules there
are exceptions this one cannot be supposed to be free from them Under
all circumstances and in all classes of society there are
single-minded beings who consult the pure dictates of their own hearts
and who disdaining those things which make up the amount of the
ambition of meaner spirits stand aloof as bright and memorable examples
to the rest of human nature

Such a being was Flora Bannerworth She would never have been found to
sacrifice herself to the fancied advantages of wealth and station but
would have given her heart and hand to the true object of her affection
although a sovereign prince had made the endeavour to wean her from it


My company was charming

Opposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus she was
not a casual woman of the half-world who under this pseudonym wages
war against the enemy sex like Mademoiselle Cleopatra but the real
true goddess of love

She sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire whose
reflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes
and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them

Her head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes it was all
I could see of her She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge
fur and rolled herself up trembling like a cat

I don't understand it I exclaimed It isn't really cold any
longer For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather You
must be nervous

Much obliged for your spring she replied with a low stony voice
and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely twice in succession I
really can't stand it here much longer and I am beginning to
understand 

What dear lady

I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the
un-understandable All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of
woman and German philosophy and I am no longer surprised that you of
the North do not know how to love haven't even an idea of what love
is

But madame I replied flaring up I surely haven't given you any
reason

Oh you  The divinity sneezed for the third time and shrugged
her shoulders with inimitable grace That's why I have always been
nice to you and even come to see you now and then although I catch
a cold every time in spite of all my furs Do you remember the first
time we met

How could I forget it I said You wore your abundant hair in
brown curls and you had brown eyes and a red mouth but I recognized
you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like
pallor you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with
squirrel-skin

You were really in love with the costume and awfully docile

You have taught me what love is Your serene form of worship let me
forget two thousand years

And my faithfulness to you was without equal

Well as far as faithfulness goes 

Ungrateful

I will not reproach you with anything You are a divine woman but
nevertheless a woman and like every woman cruel in love

What you call cruel the goddess of love replied eagerly is
simply the element of passion and of natural love which is woman's
nature and makes her give herself where she loves and makes her love
everything that pleases her

Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the
unfaithfulness of the woman he loves

Indeed she replied We are faithful as long as we love but you
demand faithfulness of a woman without love and the giving of
herself without enjoyment Who is cruel there woman or man You of
the North in general take love too soberly and seriously You talk
of duties where there should be only a question of pleasure

That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous and our
relations permanent

And yet a restless always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of
paganism she interrupted but that love which is the highest joy
which is divine simplicity itself is not for you moderns you
children of reflection It works only evil in you As soon as you
wish to be natural you become common To you nature seems something
hostile you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece and
out of me a demon You can only exorcise and curse me or slay
yourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar And if ever one of
you has had the courage to kiss my red mouth he makes a barefoot
pilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow
from his withered staff while under my feet roses violets and
myrtles spring up every hour but their fragrance does not agree with
you Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense let us
pagans remain under the debris beneath the lava do not disinter us
Pompeii was not built for you nor our villas our baths our temples
You do not require gods We are chilled in your world

The beautiful marble woman coughed and drew the dark sables still
closer about her shoulders

Much obliged for the classical lesson I replied but you cannot
deny that man and woman are mortal enemies in your serene sunlit
world as well as in our foggy one In love there is union into a
single being for a short time only capable of only one thought one
sensation one will in order to be then further disunited And you
know this better than I whichever of the two fails to subjugate will
soon feel the feet of the other on his neck 

And as a rule the man that of the woman cried Madame Venus with
proud mockery which you know better than I

Of course and that is why I don't have any illusions

You mean you are now my slave without illusions and for that
reason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy

Madame

Don't you know me yet Yes I am cruel since you take so much
delight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so Man is the one
who desires woman the one who is desired This is woman's entire but
decisive advantage Through his passion nature has given man into
woman's hands and the woman who does not know how to make him her
subject her slave her toy and how to betray him with a smile in the
end is not wise

Exactly your principles I interrupted angrily

They are based on the experience of thousands of years she
replied ironically while her white fingers played over the dark fur
The more devoted a woman shows herself the sooner the man sobers
down and becomes domineering The more cruelly she treats him and the
more faithless she is the worse she uses him the more wantonly she
plays with him the less pity she shows him by so much the more will
she increase his desire be loved worshipped by him So it has
always been since the time of Helen and Delilah down to Catherine
the Second and Lola Montez

I cannot deny I said that nothing will attract a man more than
the picture of a beautiful passionate cruel and despotic woman who
wantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her
whim 

And in addition wears furs exclaimed the divinity

What do you mean by that

I know your predilection

Do you know I interrupted that since we last saw each other
you have grown very coquettish

In what way may I ask

In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater
advantage than by these dark furs and that 

The divinity laughed

You are dreaming she cried wake up and she clasped my arm
with her marble-white hand Do wake up she repeated raucously with
the low register of her voice I opened my eyes with difficulty

I saw the hand which shook me and suddenly it was brown as bronze
the voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who
stood before me at his full height of nearly six feet

Do get up continued the good fellow it is really disgraceful

What is disgraceful

To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides He snuffed
the candles which had burned down and picked up the volume which had
fallen from my hand with a book by he looked at the title page 
by Hegel Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr
Severin's who is expecting us for tea

A curious dream said Severin when I had finished He supported
his arms on his knees resting his face in his delicate finely
veined hands and fell to pondering

I knew that he wouldn't move for a long time hardly even breathe This
actually happened but I didn't consider his behavior as in any way
remarkable I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly
three years and gotten used to his peculiarities For it cannot be
denied that he was peculiar although he wasn't quite the dangerous
madman that the neighborhood or indeed the entire district of Kolomea
considered him to be I found his personality not only interesting and
that is why many also regarded me a bit mad but to a degree
sympathetic For a Galician nobleman and land-owner and considering his
age he was hardly over thirty he displayed surprising sobriety a
certain seriousness even pedantry He lived according to a minutely
elaborated half-philosophical half-practical system like clock-work
not this alone but also by the thermometer barometer aerometer
hydrometer Hippocrates Hufeland Plato Kant Knigge and Lord
Chesterfield But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion and
gave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a
wall At such times every one preferred to get out of his way

While he remained silent the fire sang in the chimney and the large
venerable samovar sang and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking
to and fro smoking my cigar and the cricket in the old walls sang
too I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus skeletons of
animals stuffed birds globes plaster-casts with which his room
was heaped full until by chance my glance remained fixed on a
picture which I had seen often enough before But to-day under the
reflected red glow of the fire it made an indescribable impression
on me

It was a large oil painting done in the robust full-bodied manner
of the Belgian school Its subject was strange enough

A beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face with abundant
hair tied into a classical knot on which white powder lay like a
soft hoarfrost was resting on an ottoman supported on her left arm
She was nude in her dark furs Her right hand played with a lash
while her bare foot rested carelessly on a man lying before her like
a slave like a dog In the sharply outlined but well-formed
linaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate
devotion he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a
martyr This man the footstool for her feet was Severin but
beardless and it seemed some ten years younger

Venus in Furs I cried pointing to the picture That is the way
I saw her in my dream

I too said Severin only I dreamed my dream with open eyes

Indeed

It is a tiresome story

Your picture apparently suggested my dream I continued But do
tell me what it means I can imagine that it played a role in your
life and perhaps a very decisive one But the details I can only get
from you

Look at its counterpart replied my strange friend without
heeding my question

The counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian's well-known Venus
with the Mirror in the Dresden Gallery

And what is the significance

Severin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which
Titian garbed his goddess of love

It too is aVenus in Furshe said with a slight smile I
don't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention He
simply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina and was
tactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her
majestic allure with cold satisfaction He looks as though his task
were becoming burdensome enough The picture is painted flattery
Later anexpertin the Rococo period baptized the lady with the
name of Venus The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model
wrapped herself probably more for fear of a cold than out of
modesty have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that
constitute woman's essence and her beauty

But enough of that The picture as it now exists is a bitter
satire on our love Venus in this abstract North in this icy
Christian world has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch
cold 

Severin laughed and lighted a fresh cigarette

Just then the door opened and an attractive stoutish blonde girl
entered She had wise kindly eyes was dressed in black silk and
brought us cold meat and eggs with our tea Severin took one of the
latter and decapitated it with his knife

Didn't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled he cried with a
violence that made the young woman tremble

But my dear Sevtchu  she said timidly

Sevtchu nothing he yelled you are to obey obey do you
understand and he tore the kantchuk Footnote A long whip with a
short handle which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook

The woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe

Just wait I'll get you yet he called after her

But Severin I said placing my hand on his arm how can you treat
a pretty young woman thus

Look at the woman he replied blinking humorously with his eyes
Had I flattered her she would have cast the noose around my neck
but now when I bring her up with the kantchuk she adores me

Nonsense

Nonsense nothing that is the way you have to break in women

Well if you like it live like a pasha in your harem but don't
lay down theories for me 

Why not he said animatedly Goethe'syou must be hammer or anvil'
is absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman
Didn't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you Woman's power lies
in man's passion and she knows how to use it if man doesn't
understand himself He has only one choice to be the tyrant over or
the slave of woman As soon as he gives in his neck is under the
yoke and the lash will soon fall upon him

Strange maxims

Not maxims but experiences he replied nodding his head I have
actually felt the lash I am cured Do you care to know how

He rose and got a small manuscript from his massive desk and put
it in front of me

You have already asked about the picture I have long owed you an
explanation Here read

Severin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me and seemed
to dream with open eyes Silence had fallen again and again the fire
sang in the chimney and the samovar and the cricket in the old
walls I opened the manuscript and read

CONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN

The margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known
lines from Faust

Thou supersensual sensual wooer
A woman leads you by the nose
MEPHISTOPHELES

I turned the title-page and read What follows has been compiled
from my diary of that period because it is impossible ever frankly
to write of one's past but in this way everything retains its fresh
colors the colors of the present

Gogol the Russian Moliere says where well somewhere the real
comic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down

A wonderful saying

So I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down The
atmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers
which overcomes me and gives me a headache The smoke of the
fireplace curls and condenses into figures small gray-bearded
kokolds that mockingly point their finger at me Chubby-cheeked
cupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees I have to smile
involuntarily even laugh aloud as I am writing down my adventures
Yet I am not writing with ordinary ink but with red blood that drips
from my heart All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it
throbs and hurts and now and then a tear falls on the paper

The days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort
You see no one and no one sees you It is boring enough to write idyls
I would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings
furnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season a dozen
virtuosos with concertos trios and duos but what am I saying the
upshot of it all is that I don't do much more than to stretch the
canvas smooth the bow line the scores For I am no false modesty
Friend Severin you can lie to others but you don't quite succeed any
longer in lying to yourself I am nothing but a dilettante a dilettante
in painting in poetry in music and several other of the so-called
unprofitable arts which however at present secure for their masters
the income of a cabinet minister or even that of a minor potentate
Above all else I am a dilettante in life

Up to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry
I never got far beyond the preparation the plan the first act the
first stanza There are people like that who begin everything and
never finish anything I am such a one

But what am I saying

To the business in hand

I lie in my window and the miserable little town which fills me
with despondency really seems infinitely full of poetry How
wonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven
with golden sunlight mountain-torrents weave through them like
ribbons of silver How clear and blue the heavens into which
snowcapped crags project how green and fresh the forested slopes
the meadows on which small herds graze down to the yellow billows
of grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again

The house in which I live stands in a sort of park or forest or
wilderness whatever one wants to call it and is very solitary

Its sole inhabitants are myself a widow from Lemberg and Madame
Tartakovska who runs the house a little old woman who grows older
and smaller each day There are also an old dog that limps on one
leg and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn This
ball of yarn I believe belongs to the widow

She is said to be really beautiful this widow still very young
twenty-four at the most and very rich She dwells in the first story
and I on the ground floor She always keeps the green blinds drawn and
has a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants I for my
part down below have a comfortable intimate arbor of honeysuckle in
which I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs I
can look up on the balcony Sometimes I actually do so and then from
time to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network

Really the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much for I
am in love with someone else and terribly unhappy at that far more
unhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon
l'Escault because the object of my adoration is of stone

In the garden in the tiny wilderness there is a graceful little
meadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully On this meadow is
a stone statue of Venus the original of which I believe is in
Florence This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in
all my life

That however does not signify much for I have seen few beautiful
women or rather few women at all In love too I am a dilettante who
never got beyond the preparation the first act

But why talk in superlatives as if something that is beautiful
could be surpassed

It is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful I love her
passionately with a morbid intensity madly as one can only love a
woman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally
uniform eternally calm stony smile I literally adore her

I often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when
the sun broods over the forest Often I visit that cold cruel
mistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her with the
face pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest and
my prayers go up to her

The rising moon which just now is waning produces an indescribable
effect It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow
in its gleam of silver The goddess stands as if transfigured and
seems to bathe in the soft moonlight

Once when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks
leading to the house I suddenly saw a woman's figure white as
stone under the illumination of the moon and separated from me
merely by a screen of trees It seemed as if the beautiful woman of
marble had taken pity on me become alive and followed me I was
seized by a nameless fear my heart threatened to burst and instead 

Well I am a dilettante As always I broke down at the second
stanza rather on the contrary I did not break down but ran away
as fast as my legs would carry me

                            

What an accident Through a Jew dealing in photographs I secured a
picture of my ideal It is a small reproduction of Titian's Venus
with the Mirror What a woman I want to write a poem but instead
I take the reproduction and write on it Venus in Furs

You are cold while you yourself fan flames By all means wrap
yourself in your despotic furs there is no one to whom they are more
appropriate cruel goddess of love and of beauty After a while I add
a few verses from Goethe which I recently found in his paralipomena
to Faust

TO AMOR

The pair of wings a fiction are
The arrows they are naught but claws
The wreath conceals the little horns
For without any doubt he is
Like all the gods of ancient Greece
Only a devil in disguise

Then I put the picture before me on my table supporting it with a
book and looked at it

I was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by
the cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms
in her furs of dark sable by the severity and hardness which lay in
this cold marble-like face Again I took my pen in hand and wrote
the following words

To love to be loved what happiness And yet how the glamour of
this pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a
woman who makes a plaything out of us of being the slave of a
beautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot Even Samson the
hero the giant again put himself into the hands of Delilah even
after she had betrayed him and again she betrayed him and the
Philistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end
he kept fixed drunken with rage and love upon the beautiful
betrayer

I was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor and reading in the Book
of Judith I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman
who cut off his head with a sword and because of his beautiful
sanguinary end

The almighty Lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into the
hands of a woman

This sentence strangely impressed me

How ungallant these Jews are I thought And their God might choose
more becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex

The almighty Lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into the
hands of a woman I repeated to myself What shall I do so that He
may punish me

Heaven preserve us Here comes the housekeeper who has again
diminished somewhat in size overnight And up there among the green
twinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again Is it Venus
or the widow

This time it happens to be the widow for Madame Tartakovska makes
a courtesy and asks me in her name for something to read I run to
my room and gather together a couple of volumes

Later I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them and now
it and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there
together What will she say

I hear her laugh

Is she laughing at me

It is full moon It is already peering over the tops of the low
hemlocks that fringe the park A silvery exhalation fills the
terrace the groups of trees all the landscape as far as the eye
can reach in the distance it gradually fades away like trembling
waters

I cannot resist I feel a strange urge and call within me I put on
my clothes again and go out into the garden

Some power draws me toward the meadow toward her who is my
divinity and my beloved

The night is cool I feel a slight chill The atmosphere is heavy
with the odor of flowers and of the forest It intoxicates

What solemnity What music round about A nightingale sobs The
stars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour The meadow seems
smooth like a mirror like a covering of ice on a pond

The statue of Venus stands out august and luminous

But what has happened From the marble shoulders of the goddess a
large dark fur flows down to her heels I stand dumbfounded and stare
at her in amazement again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me
and I take flight

I hasten my steps and notice that I have missed the main path As
I am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus
sitting before me on a stone bench not the beautiful woman of
marble but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing
pulses She has actually come to life for me like the statue that
began to breathe for her creator Indeed the miracle is only half
completed Her white hair seems still to be of stone and her white
gown shimmers like moonlight or is it satin From her shoulders the
dark fur flows But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks
begin to take color Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall
upon me and now she laughs

Her laughter is very mysterious very I don't know It cannot be
described it takes my breath away I flee further and after every
few steps I have to pause to take breath The mocking laughter
pursues me through the dark leafy paths across light open spaces
through the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce I can no
longer find my way I wander about utterly confused with cold drops
of perspiration on the forehead

Finally I stand still and engage in a short monologue

It runs well one is either very polite to one's self or very rude

I say to myself

Donkey

This word exercises a remarkable effect like a magic formula which
sets me free and makes me master of myself

I am perfectly quiet in a moment

With considerable pleasure I repeat Donkey

Now everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again
There is the fountain there the alley of box-wood there the house
which I am slowly approaching

Yet suddenly the appearance is here again Behind the green screen
through which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with
silver I again see the white figure the woman of stone whom I
adore whom I fear and flee

With a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and
reflect

What am I really a little dilettante or a great big donkey

A sultry morning the atmosphere is dead heavily laden with odors
yet stimulating Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor reading
in the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers
into beasts A wonderful picture of antique love

There is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my
book rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling

A woman's dress 

She is there Venus but without furs No this time it is merely
the widow and yet Venus-oh what a woman

As she stands there in her light white morning gown looking at me her
slight figure seems full of poetry and grace She is neither large nor
small her head is alluring piquant in the sense of the period of the
French marquises rather than formally beautiful What enchantment and
softness what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth Her
skin is so infinitely delicate that the blue veins show through
everywhere even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom How
abundant her red hair-it is red not blonde or golden-yellow how
diabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck Now her eyes
meet mine like green lightnings they are green these eyes of hers
whose power is so indescribable green but as are precious stones or
deep unfathomable mountain lakes

She observes my confusion which has even made me discourteous for I
have remained seated and still have my cap on my head

She smiles roguishly

Finally I rise and bow to her She comes closer and bursts out into
a loud almost childlike laughter I stammer as only a little
dilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion

Thus our acquaintance began

The divinity asks for my name and mentions her own

Her name is Wanda von Dunajew

And she is actually my Venus

But madame what put the idea into your head

The little picture in one of your books 

I had forgotten about it

The curious notes on its back 

Why curious

She looked at me

I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time for the sake
of the change and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe

Dear lady in fact  Again I fell victim to an odious asinine
stammering and in addition blushed in a way that might have been
appropriate for a youngster of sixteen but not for me who was
almost a full ten years older 

You were afraid of me last night

Really of course but won't you sit down

She sat down and enjoyed my embarrassment for actually I was even
more afraid of her now in the full light of day A delightful
expression of contempt hovered about her upper lip

You look at love and especially woman she began as something
hostile something against which you put up a defense even if
unsuccessfully You feel that their power over you gives you a
sensation of pleasurable torture of pungent cruelty This is a
genuinely modern point of view

You don't share it

I do not share it she said quickly and decisively shaking her
head so that her curls flew up like red flames

The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene
sensuousness of the Greeks pleasure without pain I do not believe
in the kind of love which is preached by Christianity by the
moderns by the knights of the spirit Yes look at me I am worse
than a heretic I am a pagan

Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel
When in Ida's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles'

These lines from Goethe's Roman Elegy have always delighted me

In nature there is only the love of the heroic agewhen gods and
goddesses lovedAt that timedesire followed the glance enjoyment
desireAll else is factitious affected a lie Christianity whose
cruel emblem the cross has always had for me an element of the
monstrous brought something alien and hostile into nature and its
innocent instincts

The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern
man I do not care to have a share in it

Yes Mount Olympus would be the place for you madame I replied
but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity least of
all in love The idea of sharing a woman even if it were an Aspasia
with another revolts us We are jealous as is our God For example
we have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne

We prefer one of Holbein's meagre pallid virgins which is wholly
ours to an antique Venus no matter how divinely beautiful she is
but who loves Anchises to-day Paris to-morrow Adonis the day after
And if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing
passionate devotion to such a woman her serene joy of life appears
to us as something demonic and cruel and we read into our happiness
a sin which we must expiate

So you too are one of those who rave about modern women those
miserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a real
man in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine
ideal Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian
duties they cheat and are cheated they always seek again and choose
and reject they are never happy and never give happiness They
accuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and
live as Helen and Aspasia lived Nature admits of no permanence in
the relation between man and woman

But my dear lady 

Let me finish It is only man's egoism which wants to keep woman
like some buried treasure All endeavors to introduce permanence in
love the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence
have gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies vows and
legalities Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself
over to corruption

But 

But you are about to say the individual who rebels against the
arrangements of society is ostracized branded stoned So be it I
am willing to take the risk my principles are very pagan I will
live my own life as it pleases me I am willing to do without your
hypocritical respect I prefer to be happy The inventors of the
Christian marriage have done well simultaneously to invent
immortality I however have no wish to live eternally When with
my last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned
comes to an end here below what does it profit me whether my pure
spirit joins the choirs of angels or whether my dust goes into the
formation of new beings Shall I belong to one man whom I don't love
merely because I have once loved him No I do not renounce I love
everyone who pleases me and give happiness to everyone who loves me
Is that ugly No it is more beautiful by far than if cruelly I
enjoy the tortures which my beauty excites and virtuously reject
the poor fellow who is pining away for me I am young rich and
beautiful and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and
enjoyment

While she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly and I had taken
hold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them but
being a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again

Your frankness I said delights me and not it alone 

My confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were
a rope around my neck

You were about to say 

I was about to say I was I am sorry I interrupted you

How so

A long pause She is doubtless engaging in a monologue which
translated into my language would be comprised in the single word
donkey

If I may ask I finally began how did you arrive at these these
conclusions

Quite simply my father was an intelligent man From my cradle onward
I was surrounded by replicas of ancient art at ten years of age I
read Gil Blas at twelve La Pucelle Where others had
Hop-o'-my-thumb Bluebeard Cinderella as childhood friends mine
were Venus and Apollo Hercules and Lackoon My husband's personality
was filled with serenity and sunlight Not even the incurable illness
which fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow
On the very night of his death he took me in his arms and during the
many months when he lay dying in his wheel chair he often said
jokingly to meWell have you already picked out a loverI blushed
with shameDon't deceive mehe added on one occasionthat would
seem ugly to me but pick out an attractive lover or preferably
several You are a splendid woman but still half a child and you
need toys'

I suppose I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had
no lover but it was through him that I have become what I am a
woman of Greece

A goddess I interrupted

Which one she smiled

Venus

She threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows Perhaps
even aVenus in FursWatch out I have a large very large fur
with which I could cover you up entirely and I have a mind to catch
you in it as in a net

Do you believe I said quickly for an idea which seemed good in
spite of its conventionality and triteness flashed into my head do
you believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the
present time that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity
among our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and
serenity

Undraped of course not but in furs she replied smiling would
you care to see mine

And then 

What then

Beautiful free serene and happy human beings such as the Greeks
were are only possible when it is permitted to have slaves who will
perform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else
labor for them

Of course she replied playfully an Olympian divinity such as
I am requires a whole army of slaves Beware of me

Why

I myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this
why it did not startle her in the least

She drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became
visible and then said lightly as if she were discussing some
trifling matter Do you want to be my slave

There is no equality in love I replied solemnly Whenever it is
a matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled it seems much
more satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman But
where shall I find the woman who knows how to rule calmly full of
self-confidence even harshly and not seek to gain her power by
means of petty nagging

Oh that might not be so difficult

You think 

I for instance  she laughed and leaned far back I have a real
talent for despotism I also have the necessary furs but last night
you were really seriously afraid of me

Quite seriously

And now

Now I am more afraid of you than ever

We are together every day I and Venus we are together a great
deal We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor and have tea in her
little sitting-room I have an opportunity to unfold all my small
very small talents Of what use would have been my study of all the
various sciences my playing at all the arts if I were unable in the
case of a pretty little woman 

But this woman is by no means little in fact she impresses me
tremendously I made a drawing of her to-day and felt particularly
clearly how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a
cameo-head like hers The configuration of her face has little of the
Roman but much of the Greek

Sometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche and then again as
Astarte It depends upon the expression in her eyes whether it is
vaguely dreamy or half-consuming filled with tired desire
She however insists that it be a portrait-likeness

I shall make her a present of furs

How could I have any doubts If not for her for whom would princely
furs be suitable

                            

I was with her yesterday evening reading the Roman Elegies to her
Then I laid the book aside and improvised something for her She
seemed pleased rather more than that she actually hung upon my
words and her bosom heaved

Or was I mistaken

The rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes the fire
crackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort I felt quite at home
with her and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman
I kissed her hand and she permitted it

Then I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for
her

VENUS IN FURS

Place thy foot upon thy slave
Oh thou half of hell half of dreams
Among the shadows dark and grave
Thy extended body softly gleams

And so on This time I really got beyond the first stanza At her
request I gave her the poem in the evening keeping no copy And now
as I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first
stanza

I am filled with a very curious sensation I don't believe that I am
in love with Wanda I am sure that at our first meeting I felt
nothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion But I feel how her
extraordinary really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares
about me It isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me it
is a physical subjection coming on slowly but for that reason more
absolutely

I suffer under it more and more each day and she she merely smiles

                            

Without any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day You
interest me Most men are very commonplace without verve or poetry
In you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a
deep seriousness which delight me I might learn to love you

After a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow
and the statue of Venus All about us the earth steamed mists rose
up toward heaven like clouds of incense a shattered rainbow still
hovered in the air The trees were still shedding drops but sparrows
and finches were already hopping from twig to twig They are
twittering gaily as if very much pleased at something Everything
is filled with a fresh fragrance We cannot cross the meadow for it
is still wet In the sunlight it looks like a small pool and the
goddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like
surface About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing which
illuminated by the sun seem to hover above her like an aureole

Wanda is enjoying the lovely scene As all the benches along the
walk are still wet she supports herself on my arm to rest a while
A soft weariness permeates her whole being her eyes are half closed
I feel the touch of her breath on my cheek

How I managed to get up courage enough I really don't know but I
took hold of her hand asking

Could you love me

Why not she replied letting her calm clear look rest upon me
but not for long

A moment later I am kneeling before her pressing my burning face
against the fragrant muslin of her gown

But Severin this isn't right she cried

But I take hold of her little foot and press my lips upon it

You are getting worse and worse she cried She tore herself free
and fled rapidly toward the house the while her adorable slipper
remained in my hand

Is it an omen

                            

All day long I didn't dare to go near her Toward evening as I was
sitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the
greenery of her balcony Why don't you come up he called down
impatiently

I ran upstairs and at the top lost courage again I knocked very
lightly She didn't say come-in but opened the door herself and
stood on the threshold

Where is my slipper

It is I have I want I stammered

Get it and then we will have tea together and chat

When I returned she was engaged in making tea I ceremoniously
placed the slipper on the table and stood in the corner like a child
awaiting punishment

I noticed that her brows were slightly contracted and there was an
expression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted
me

All of a sudden she broke out laughing

So you are really in love with me

Yes and I suffer more from it than you can imagine

You suffer she laughed again

I was revolted mortified annihilated but all this was quite
useless

Why she continued I like you with all my heart

She gave me her hand and looked at me in the friendliest fashion

And will you be my wife

Wanda looked at me how did she look at me I think first of all
with surprise and then with a tinge of irony

What has given you so much courage all at once

Courage

Yes courage to ask anyone to be your wife and me in particular
She lifted up the slipper Was it through a sudden friendship with
this But joking aside Do you really wish to marry me

Yes

Well Severin that is a serious matter I believe you love me
and I care for you too and what is more important each of us finds
the other interesting There is no danger that we would soon get
bored but you know I am a fickle person and just for that reason
I take marriage seriously If I assume obligations I want to be able
to meet them But I am afraid no it would hurt you

Please be perfectly frank with me I replied

Well then honestly I don't believe I could love a man longer than 
She inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused

A year

What do you imagine a month perhaps

Not even me

Oh you perhaps two

Two months I exclaimed

Two months is very long

You go beyond antiquity madame

You see you cannot stand the truth

Wanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace
watching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece

What shall I do with you she began anew

Whatever you wish I replied with resignation whatever will give
you pleasure

How illogical she cried first you want to make me your wife
and then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with

Wanda I love you

Now we are back to the place where we started You love me and
want to make me your wife but I don't want to enter into a new
marriage because I doubt the permanence of both my and your
feelings

But if I am willing to take the risk with you I replied

But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you
she said quietly I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my
entire life but he would have to be a whole man a man who would
dominate me who would subjugate me by his inate strength do you
understand And every man I know this very well as soon as he falls
in love becomes weak pliable ridiculous He puts himself into the
woman's hands kneels down before her The only man whom I could love
permanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel I've gotten
to like you so much however that I'll try it with you

I fell down at her feet

For heaven's sake here you are kneeling already she said
mockingly You are making a good beginning When I had risen again
she continued I will give you a year's time to win me to convince
me that we are suited to each other that we might live together If
you succeed I will become your wife and a wife Severin who will
conscientiously and strictly perform all her duties During this year
we will live as though we were married 

My blood rose to my head

In her eyes too there was a sudden flame 

We will live together she continued share our daily life so that
we may find out whether we are really fitted for each other I grant
you all the rights of a husband of a lover of a friend Are you
satisfied

I suppose I'll have to be

You don't have to

Well then I want to 

Splendid That is how a man speaks Here is my hand

                            

For ten days I have been with her every hour except at night All
the time I was allowed to look into her eyes hold her hands listen
to what she said accompany her wherever she went

My love seems to me like a deep bottomless abyss into which I
subside deeper and deeper There is nothing now which could save me
from it

This afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the
Venus-statue I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap she
wound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess

Suddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became
confused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration Losing
command over myself I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips
and she she drew me close to her heaving breast

Are you angry I then asked her

I am never angry at anything that is natural  she replied but
I am afraid you suffer

Oh I am suffering frightfully

Poor friend she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head I
hope it isn't through any fault of mine

No  I replied and yet my love for you has become a sort of
madness The thought that I might lose you perhaps actually lose
you torments me day and night

But you don't yet possess me said Wanda and again she looked at
me with that vibrant consuming expression which had already once
before carried me away Then she rose and with her small transparent
hands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head
of Venus Half against my will I threw my arm around her body

I can no longer live without you oh wonderful woman I said
Believe me believe only this once that this time it is not a
phrase not a thing of dreams I feel deep down in my innermost soul
that my life belongs inseparably with yours If you leave me I shall
perish go to pieces

That will hardly be necessary for I love you she took hold of my
chin you foolish man

But you will be mine only under conditions while I belong to you
unconditionally 

That isn't wise Severin she replied almost with a start Don't
you know me yet do you absolutely refuse to know me I am good when
I am treated seriously and reasonably but when you abandon yourself
too absolutely to me I grow arrogant 

So be it be arrogant be despotic I cried in the fulness of
exaltation only be mine mine forever I lay at her feet
embracing her knees

Things will end badly my friend she said soberly without moving

It shall never end I cried excitedly almost violently Only death
shall part us If you cannot be mine all mine and for always then I
want to be your slave serve you suffer everything from you if only
you won't drive me away

Calm yourself she said bending down and kissing my forehead I
am really very fond of you but your way is not the way to win and
hold me

I want to do everything absolutely everything that you want only
not to lose you I cried only not that I cannot bear the thought

Do get up

I obeyed

You are a strange person continued Wanda You wish to possess me
at any price

Yes at any price

But of what value for instance would that be She pondered a
lurking uncanny expression entered her eyes If I no longer loved
you if I belonged to another

A shudder ran through me I looked at her She stood firmly and
confident before me and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam

You see she continued the very thought frightens you A
beautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face

I feel a perfect horror when I imagine that the woman I love and
who has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless
of me But have I still a choice If I love such a woman even unto
madness shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake
of a bit of boastful strength shall I send a bullet through my
brains I have two ideals of woman If I cannot obtain the one that
is noble and simple the woman who will faithfully and truly share
my life well then I don't want anything half-way or lukewarm Then
I would rather be subject to a woman without virtue fidelity or pity
Such a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal If
I am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love fully and wholly
I want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs I want to
be maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love and the more cruelly
the better This too is a luxury

Have you lost your senses cried Wanda

I love you with all my soul I continued with all my senses and
your presence and personality are absolutely essential to me if I
am to go on living Choose between my ideals Do with me what you will
make of me your husband or your slave

Very well said Wanda contracting her small but strongly arched
brows it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man
who interests me and loves me completely in my power at least I
shall not lack pastime You were imprudent enough to leave the choice
to me Therefore I choose I want you to be my slave I shall make
a plaything for myself out of you

Oh please do I cried half-shuddering half-enraptured If the
foundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement it is
likewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites We
are such opposites almost enemies That is why my love is part hate
part fear In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other
anvil I wish to be the anvil I cannot be happy when I look down
upon the woman I love I want to adore a woman and this I can only
do when she is cruel towards me

But Severin replied Wanda almost angrily do you believe me
capable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do and whom I love

Why not if I adore you the more on this account It is possible to
love really only that which stands above us a woman who through her
beauty temperament intelligence and strength of will subjugates us
and becomes a despot over us

Then that which repels others attracts you

Yes That is the strange part of me

Perhaps after all there isn't anything so very unique or strange
in all your passions for who doesn't love beautiful furs And
everyone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are
related

But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest
degree I replied

In other words reason has little power over you and you are by
nature soft sensual yielding

Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature

The martyrs

On the contrary they were supersensual men who found enjoyment in
suffering They sought out the most frightful tortures even death
itself as others seek joy and as they were so am I supersensual

Have a care that in being such you do not become a martyr to love
the martyr of a woman

We are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant
summer night A twofold roof is above us first the green ceiling of
climbing-plants and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable
stars The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park I am
sitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity and am telling her
of my childhood

And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked
in you asked Wanda

Of course I can't remember a time when I didn't have them Even in
my cradle so mother has told me I was supersensual I scorned the
healthy breast of my nurse and had to be brought up on goatsmilk
As a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women which really was
only an expression of an inordinate interest in them I was oppressed
by the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church and actually
afraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints Secretly
however I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood
in my father's little library I kneeled down before her and to her I
said the prayers I had been taught the Paternoster the Ave Maria
and the Credo

Once at night I left my bed to visit her The sickle of the moon
was my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light I
prostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet as I had seen
our peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior

An irresistible yearning seized me

I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold
lips A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled and later in a dream
it seemed to me as if the goddess stood beside my bed threatening
me with up-raised arm

I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium I
passionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world
of antiquity accessible to me Soon I was more familiar with the gods
of Greece than with the religion of Jesus I was with Paris when he
gave the fateful apple to Venus I saw Troy burn and followed
Ulysses on his wanderings The prototypes of all that is beautiful
sank deep into my soul and consequently at the time when other boys
are coarse and obscene I displayed an insurmountable aversion to
everything base vulgar unbeautiful

To me the maturing youth love for women seemed something
especially base and unbeautiful for it showed itself to me first in
all its commonness I avoided all contact with the fair sex in
short I was supersensual to madness

When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid
young attractive with a figure just budding into womanhood I was
sitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the
virtues of the ancient Teutons while she was sweeping my room
Suddenly she stopped bent down over me in the meantime holding fast
to the broom and a pair of fresh full adorable lips touched mine
The kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder
but I raised up my Germania like a shield against the temptress
and indignantly left the room

Wanda broke out in loud laughter It would indeed be hard to find
another man like you but continue

There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period
I continued my story Countess Sobol a distant aunt of mine was
visiting my parents She was a beautiful majestic woman with an
attractive smile I however hated her for she was regarded by the
family as a sort of Messalina My behavior toward her was as rude
malicious and awkward as possible

One day my parents drove to the capital of the district My aunt
determined to take advantage of their absence and to exercise
judgment over me She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined
kazabaika Footnote A woman's jacket followed by the cook
kitchen-maid and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned
Without asking any questions they seized me and bound me hand and
foot in spite of my violent resistance Then my aunt with an evil
smile rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch
She whipped so hard that the blood flowed and that at last
notwithstanding my heroic spirit I cried and wept and begged for
mercy She then had me untied but I had to get down on my knees and
thank her for the punishment and kiss her hand

Now you understand the supersensual fool Under the lash of a
beautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman In her
fur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen and from then on
my aunt became the most desirable woman on God's earth

My Cato-like austerity my shyness before woman was nothing but an
excessive feeling for beauty In my imagination sensuality became a
sort of cult I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its
holy wealth upon any ordinary person but I would reserve it for an
ideal woman if possible for the goddess of love herself

I went to the university at a very early age It was in the capital
where my aunt lived My room looked at that time like Doctor
Faustus's Everything in it was in a wild confusion There were huge
closets stuffed full of books which I bought for a song from a
Jewish dealer on the Servanica Footnote The street of the Jews in
Lemberg there were globes atlases flasks charts of the heavens
skeletons of animals skulls the busts of eminent men It looked as
though Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge
green store as a wandering scholiast at any moment

I studied everything in a jumble without system without selection
chemistry alchemy history astronomy philosophy law anatomy and
literature I read Homer Virgil Ossian Schiller Goethe
Shakespeare Cervantes Voltaire Moliere the Koran the Kosmos
Casanova's Memoirs I grew more confused each day more fantastical
more supersensual All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my
imagination Every so and so often she appeared before me like a
vision among my leather-bound books and dead bones lying on a bed of
roses surrounded by cupids Sometimes she appeared gowned like the
Olympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus sometimes in
braids of a rich brown blue-eyes in my aunt's red velvet
kazabaika trimmed with ermine

One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my
imagination in all her smiling beauty I went to see Countess Sobol
who received me in a friendly even cordial manner She gave me a
kiss of welcome which put all my senses in a turmoil She was
probably about forty years old but like most well-preserved women
of the world still very attractive She wore as always her fur-edged
jacket This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten But
nothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was
now discernable

On the contrary there was so little of cruelty in her that without
any more ado she let me adore her

Only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence
and it pleased her to make me happy As for myself I was as happy
as a young god What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her
on my knees and to kiss her hands those with which she had scourged
me What marvellous hands they were of beautiful form delicate
rounded and white with adorable dimples I really was in love with
her hands only I played with them let them submerge and emerge in
the dark fur held them against the light and was unable to satiate
my eyes with them

Wanda involuntarily looked at her hand I noticed it and had to
smile

From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those
days you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I
received from my aunt and about two years later when I paid court
to a young actress only in the roles she played Still later I became
the admirer of a respectable woman She acted the part of
irreproachable virtue only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew
You see it is because I was betrayed sold by a woman who feigned
the strictest principles and the highest ideals that I hate that
sort of poetical sentimental virtue so intensely Give me rather a
woman who is honest enough to say to me I am a Pompadour a Lucretia
Borgia and I am ready to adore her

Wanda rose and opened the window

You have a curious way of arousing one's imagination stimulating
all one's nerves and making one's pulses beat faster You put an
aureole on vice provided only if it is honest Your ideal is a
daring courtesan of genius Oh you are the kind of man who will
corrupt a woman to her very last fiber

                            

In the middle of the night there was a knock at my window I got up
opened it and was startled Without stood Venus in Furs just as
she had appeared to me the first time

You have disturbed me with your stories I have been tossing about
in bed and can't go to sleep she said Now come and stay with me

In a moment

As I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had
kindled a small fire

Autumn is coming she began the nights are really quite cold
already I am afraid you may not like it but I can't put off my furs
until the room is sufficiently warm

Not like it you are joking you know  I threw my arm around her
and kissed her

Of course I know but why this great fondness for furs

I was born with it I replied I already had it as a child
Furthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized
natures This is due both to general and natural laws It is a
physical stimulus which sets you tingling and no one can wholly
escape it Science has recently shown a certain relationship between
electricity and warmth at any rate their effects upon the human
organism are related The torrid zone produces more passionate
characters a heated atmosphere stimulation Likewise with
electricity This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises
such a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect This
is why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom these
adorable scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite
animal of a Mahommed Cardinal Richelieu Crebillon Rousseau
Wieland

A woman wearing furs then cried Wanda is nothing else than a
large cat an augmented electric battery

Certainly I replied That is my explanation of the symbolic
meaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty
Monarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in
this sense for their costume exclusively great painters used it
only for queenly beauty The most beautiful frame which Raphael
could find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the
roseate body of his beloved was dark furs

Thanks for the learned discourse on love said Wanda but you
haven't told me everything You associate something entirely
individual with furs

Certainly I cried I have repeatedly told you that suffering has
a peculiar attraction for me Nothing can intensify my passion more
than tyranny cruelty and especially the faithlessness of a
beautiful woman And I cannot imagine this woman this strange ideal
derived from an aesthetics of ugliness this soul of Nero in the body
of a Phryne except in furs

I understand Wanda interrupted It gives a dominant and imposing
quality to a woman

Not only that I continued You know I am supersensual With me
everything has its roots in the imagination and thence it receives
its nourishment I was already pre-maturely developed and highly
sensitive when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs
fell into my hands I remember reading with a kind of horror which
really was rapture of how they pined in prisons were laid on the
gridiron pierced with arrows boiled in pitch thrown to wild
animals nailed to the cross and suffered the most horrible torment
with a kind of joy To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on
seemed to me exquisite delight especially when it was inflicted by a
beautiful woman for ever since I can remember all poetry and
everything demonic was for me concentrated in woman I literally
carried the idea into a sort of cult

I felt there was something sacred in sex in fact it was the only
sacred thing In woman and her beauty I saw something divine because
the most important function of existence the continuation of the
species is her vocation To me woman represented a personification of
nature Isis and man was her priest her slave In contrast to him
she was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served
her purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it To him her
cruelties even death itself still were sensual raptures

I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the
bridal night and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress
had sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game I
envied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily
ensnared in a forest near Prague and carried to her castle Divin
where after having amused herself a while with him she had him
broken on the wheel 

Disgusting cried Wanda I almost wish you might fall into the
hands of a woman of their savage race In the wolf's skin under the
teeth of the dogs or upon the wheel you would lose the taste for
your kind of poetry

Do you think so I hardly do

Have you actually lost your senses

Possibly But let me go on I developed a perfect passion for
reading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described I
loved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented
them All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne the
inquisitors who had the heretics tortured roasted and butchered
all the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful
beautiful and violent women like Libussa Lucretia Borgia Agnes of
Hungary Queen Margot Isabeau the Sultana Roxolane the Russian
Czarinas of last century all these I saw in furs or in robes
bordered with ermine

And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you said Wanda and
simultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak
coquettishly about her so that the dark shining sable played
beautifully around her bust and arms Well how do you feel now
half broken on the wheel

Her piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking
satisfaction Overcome by desire I flung myself down before her and
threw my arms about her

Yes you have awakened my dearest dream I cried It has slept
long enough

And this is She put her hand on my neck

I was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this
warm little hand and of her regard which tenderly searching fell
upon me through her half-closed lids

To be the slave of a woman a beautiful woman whom I love whom
I worship

And who on that account maltreats you interrupted Wanda laughing

Yes who fetters me and whips me treads me underfoot the while
she gives herself to another

And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of
you to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must
meet him face to face who will turn you over to his absolute mercy
Why not This final tableau doesn't please you so well

I looked at Wanda frightened

You surpass my dreams

Yes we women are inventive she said take heed when you find
your ideal it might easily happen that she will treat you more
cruelly than you anticipate

I am afraid that I have already found my ideal I exclaimed
burying my burning face in her lap

Not I exclaimed Wanda throwing off her furs and moving about the
room laughing She was still laughing as I went downstairs and when
I stood musing in the yard I still heard her peals of laughter above

                            

Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal Wanda asked
archly when we met in the park to-day

At first I could find no answer The most antagonistic emotions were
battling within me In the meantime she sat down on one of the
stone-benches and played with a flower

Well am I

I kneeled down and seized her hands

Once more I beg you to become my wife my true and loyal wife if
you can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal absolutely
without reservation without softness

You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand if
you prove to be the man I am seeking Wanda replied very seriously
but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you
realized your imaginings Well which do you prefer

I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in
your personality

You are mistaken

I believe I continued that you enjoy having a man wholly in
your power torturing him 

No no she exclaimed quickly or perhaps  She pondered

I don't understand myself any longer she continued but I have
a confession to make to you You have corrupted my imagination and
inflamed my blood I am beginning to like the things you speak of
The enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour a Catherine the
Second and all the other selfish frivolous cruel women carries
me away and takes hold of my soul It urges me on to become like those
women who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during
their lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves

You will end by making of me a despot in miniature a domestic
Pompadour

Well then I said in agitation if all this is inherent in you
give way to this trend of your nature Nothing half-way If you can't
be a true and loyal wife to me be a demon

I was nervous from loss of sleep and the proximity of the beautiful
woman affected me like a fever I no longer recall what I said but
I remember that I kissed her feet and finally raised her foot and
put my neck under it She withdrew it quickly and rose almost angrily

If you love me Severin she said quickly and her voice sounded
sharp and commanding never speak to me of those things again
Understand never Otherwise I might really  She smiled and sat
down again

I am entirely serious I exclaimed half-raving I adore you so
infinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you for the
sake of spending my whole life near you

Severin once more I warn you

Your warning is vain Do with me what you will as long as you
don't drive me away

Severin replied Wanda I am a frivolous young woman it is
dangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power You will
end by actually becoming a plaything to me Who will give warrant
that I shall not abuse your insane desire

Your own nobility of character

Power makes people over-bearing

Be it I cried tread me underfoot

Wanda threw her arms around my neck looked into my eyes and shook
her head

I am afraid I can't but I will try for your sake for I love you
Severin as I have loved no other man

                            

To-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl and I had to go shopping
with her She looked at whips long whips with a short handle the
kind that are used on dogs

Are these satisfactory said the shopkeeper

No they are much too small replied Wanda with a side-glance at
me I need a large 

For a bull-dog I suppose opined the merchant

Yes she exclaimed of the kind that are used in Russia for
intractable slaves

She looked further and finally selected a whip at whose sight I
felt a strange creeping sensation

Now good-by Severin she said I have some other purchases to
make but you can't go along

I left her and took a walk On the way back I saw Wanda coming out
at a furrier's She beckoned me

Consider it well she began in good spirits I have never made a
secret of how deeply your serious dreamy character has fascinated
me The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power actually
lying enraptured at my feet of course stimulates me but will this
attraction last Woman loves a man she maltreats a slave and ends
by kicking him aside

Very well then kick me aside I replied when you are tired of
me I want to be your slave

Dangerous forces lie within me said Wanda after we had gone a
few steps further You awaken them and not to your advantage You
know how to paint pleasure cruelty arrogance in glowing colors
What would you say should I try my hand at them and make you the
first object of my experiments I would be like Dionysius who had the
inventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his
wails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox

Perhaps I am a female Dionysius

Be it I exclaimed and my dreams will be fulfilled I am yours
for good or evil choose The destiny that lies concealed within my
breast drives me on demoniacally relentlessly

My Beloved

I do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow and not until evening
the day after tomorrow and then as my slave

Your mistress

Wanda

As my slave was underlined I read the note which I received early
in the morning a second time Then I had a donkey saddled an animal
symbolic of learned professors and rode into the mountains I wanted
to numb my desire my yearning with the magnificent scenery of the
Carpathians I am back tired hungry thirsty and more in love than
ever I quickly change my clothes and a few moments later knock at
her door

Come in

I enter She is standing in the center of the room dressed in a gown
of white satin which floods down her body like light Over it she
wears a scarlet kazabaika richly edged with ermine Upon her
powdered snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds She stands with
her arms folded across her breast and with her brows contracted

Wanda I run toward her and am about to throw my arm about her to
kiss her She retreats a step measuring me from top to bottom

Slave

Mistress I kneel down and kiss the hem of her garment

That is as it should be

Oh how beautiful you are

Do I please you She stepped before the mirror and looked at
herself with proud satisfaction

I shall become mad

Her lower lip twitched derisively and she looked at me mockingly
from behind half-closed lids

Give me the whip

I looked about the room

No she exclaimed stay as you are kneeling She went over to
the fire-place took the whip from the mantle-piece and watching
me with a smile let it hiss through the air then she slowly rolled
up the sleeve of her fur-jacket

Marvellous woman I exclaimed

Silence slave She suddenly scowled looked savage and struck me
with the whip A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me and
pityingly bent down to me Did I hurt you she asked half-shyly
half-timidly

No I replied and even if you had pains that come through you
are a joy Strike again if it gives you pleasure

But it doesn't give me pleasure

Again I was seized with that strange intoxication

Whip me I begged whip me without mercy

Wanda swung the whip and hit me twice Are you satisfied now

No

Seriously no

Whip me I beg you it is a joy to me

Yes because you know very well that it isn't serious she
replied because I haven't the heart to hurt you This brutal game
goes against my grain Were I really the woman who beats her slaves
you would be horrified

No Wanda I replied I love you more than myself I am devoted
to you for death and life In all seriousness you can do with me
whatever you will whatever your caprice suggests

Severin

Tread me underfoot I exclaimed and flung myself face to the
floor before her

I hate all this play-acting said Wanda impatiently

Well then maltreat me seriously

An uncanny pause

Severin I warn you for the last time began Wanda

If you love me be cruel towards me I pleaded with upraised eyes

If I love you repeated Wanda Very well She stepped back and
looked at me with a sombre smile Be then my slave and know what
it means to be delivered into the hands of a woman And at the
same moment she gave me a kick

How do you like that slave

Then she flourished the whip

Get up

I was about to rise

Not that way she commanded on your knees

I obeyed and she began to apply the lash

The blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms Each one
cut into my flesh and burned there but the pains enraptured me They
came from her whom I adored and for whom I was ready at any hour to
lay down my life

She stopped I am beginning to enjoy it she said but enough for
to-day I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far
your strength goes I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and
writhe beneath my whip and in hearing your groans and wails I want
to go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy until you
lose your senses You have awakened dangerous elements in my being
But now get up

I seized her hand to press it to my lips

What impudence

She shoved me away with her foot

Out of my sight slave

                            

After having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams I
awoke Dawn was just beginning to break

How much of what was hovering in my memory was true what had I
actually experienced and what had I dreamed That I had been whipped
was certain I can still feel each blow and count the burning red
stripes on my body And she whipped me Now I know everything

My dream has become truth How does it make me feel Am I
disappointed in the realization of my dream

No I am merely somewhat tired but her cruelty has enraptured me
Oh how I love her adore her All this cannot express in the
remotest way my feeling for her my complete devotion to her What
happiness to be her slave

                            

She calls to me from her balcony I hurry upstairs She is standing
on the threshold holding out her hand in friendly fashion I am
ashamed of myself she says while I embrace her and she hides her
head against my breast

Why

Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday she said with
quivering voice I have fulfilled your mad wish now let us be
reasonable and happy and love each other and in a year I will be
your wife

My mistress I exclaimed and I your slave

Not another word of slavery cruelty or the whip interrupted
Wanda I shall not grant you any of those favors none except
wearing my fur-jacket come and help me into it

                            

The little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his
bolt struck midnight

I rose and wanted to leave

Wanda said nothing but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman
She began to kiss me anew and this silent language was so
comprehensible so convincing 

And it told me more than I dared to understand

A languid abandonment pervaded Wanda's entire being What a
voluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed
eyes in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the
white powder in the red and white satin which crackled about her
with every movement in the swelling ermine of the kazabaika
in which she carelessly nestled

Please I stammered but you will be angry with me

Do with me what you will she whispered

Well then whip me or I shall go mad

Haven't I forbidden you said Wanda sternly but you are
incorrigible

Oh I am so terribly in love I had sunken on my knees and was
burying my glowing face in her lap

I really believe said Wanda thoughtfully that your madness is
nothing but a demonic unsatisfied sensuality Our unnatural way
of life must generate such illnesses Were you less virtuous you
would be completely sane

Well then make me sane I murmured My hands were running through
her hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur which rose
and fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom and drove all
my senses into confusion

And I kissed her No she kissed me savagely pitilessly as if she
wanted to slay me with her kisses I was as in a delirium and had
long since lost my reason but now I too was breathless I sought
to free myself

What is the matter asked Wanda

I am suffering agonies

You are suffering  she broke out into a loud amused laughter

You laugh I moaned have you no idea 

She was serious all of a sudden She raised my head in her hands
and with a violent gesture drew me to her breast

Wanda I stammered

Of course you enjoy suffering she said and laughed again but
wait I'll bring you to your senses

No I will no longer ask I exclaimed whether you want to belong
to me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication I want
to drain my happiness to the full You are mine now and I would
rather lose you than never to have had you

Now you are sensible she said She kissed me again with her
murderous lips I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and
her naked breast surged against mine

Then my senses left me 

The first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping
from my hand and she asked apathetically Did you scratch me

No I believe I have bitten you

                            

It is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as
soon as a new person enters

We spent marvellous days together we visited the mountains and
lakes we read together and I completed Wanda's portrait And how
we loved one another how beautiful her smiling face was

Then a friend of hers arrived a divorced woman somewhat older more
experienced and less scrupulous than Wanda Her influence is already
making itself felt in every direction

Wanda wrinkles her brows and displays a certain impatience with me

Has she ceased loving me

                            

For almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us
Her friend lives with her and we are never alone A circle of men
surrounds the young women With my seriousness and melancholy I am
playing an absurd role as lover Wanda treats me like a stranger

To-day while out walking she staid behind with me I saw that this
was done intentionally and I rejoiced But what did she tell me

My friend doesn't understand how I can love you She doesn't think
you either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise She is
telling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous
life in the capital hinting at the advantages to which I could lay
claim the large parties which I would find there and the
distinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract But of
what use is all this since it happens that I love you

For a moment I lost my breath then I said I have no wish to stand
in the way of your happiness Wanda Do not consider me Then I
raised my hat and let her go ahead She looked at me surprised but
did not answer a syllable

When by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back she
secretly pressed my hand Her glance was so radiant so full of
promised happiness that in a moment all the torments of these days
were forgotten and all their wounds healed

I now am aware again of how much I love her

                            

My friend has complained about you said Wanda to-day

Perhaps she feels that I despise her

But why do you despise her you foolish young man exclaimed
Wanda pulling my ears with both hands

Because she is a hypocrite I said I respect only a woman who is
actually virtuous or who openly lives for pleasure's sake

Like me for instance replied Wanda jestingly but you see
child a woman can only do that in the rarest cases She can neither
be as gaily sensual nor as spiritually free as man her state is
always a mixture of the sensual and spiritual Her heart desires to
enchain man permanently while she herself is ever subject to the
desire for change The result is a conflict and thus usually against
her wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality
and corrupt her character

Certainly that is true I said The transcendental character with
which woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception

But the world likewise demands it Wanda interrupted Look at
this woman She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found
a new admirer here She deceives all three and yet is honored by all
and respected by the world

I don't care I exclaimed but she is to leave you alone she
treats you like an article of commerce

Why not the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously Every woman
has the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions
and much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasure
because if you do it in cold blood you can reap profit to best
advantage

Wanda what are you saying

Why not she said and take note of what I am about to say to you
Never feel secure with the woman you love for there are more
dangers in woman's nature than you imagine Women are neither as
good as their admirers and defenders maintain nor as bad as their
enemies make them out to be Woman's character is characterlessness
The best woman will momentarily go down into the mire and the worst
unexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to
shame those that despise her No woman is so good or so bad but that
at any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the
most divine of the filthiest as well as of the purest thoughts
emotions and actions In spite of all the advances of civilization
woman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature She has the
nature of a savage who is faithful or faithless magnanimous or
cruel according to the impulse that dominates at the moment
Throughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has
produced moral character Man even when he is selfish or evil always
follows principles woman never follows anything but impulses
Don't ever forget that and never feel secure with the woman you
love

                            

Her friend has left At last an evening alone with her again It
seems as if Wanda had saved up all the love which had been kept from
her for this superlative evening never had she been so kind so
near so full of tenderness

What happiness to cling to her lips and to die away in her arms In
a state of relaxation and wholly mine her head rests against my
breast and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other

I cannot yet believe comprehend that this woman is mine wholly
mine

She is right on one point Wanda began without moving without
opening her eyes as if she were asleep

Who

She remained silent

Your friend

She nodded Yes she is right you are not a man you are a
dreamer a charming cavalier and you certainly would be a priceless
slave but I cannot imagine you as husband

I was frightened

What is the matter You are trembling

I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you I replied

Are you made less happy now because of this she replied Does
it rob you of any of your joys that I have belonged to another
before I did to you that others after you will possess me and would
you enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you

Wanda

You see she continued that would be a way out You won't ever
lose me then I care deeply for you and intellectually we are
harmonious and I should like to live with you always if in addition
to you I might have 

What an idea I cried You fill me with a sort of horror

Do you love me any the less

On the contrary

Wanda had raised herself on her left arm I believe she said
that to hold a man permanently it is vitally important not to be
faithful to him What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved
as a hetaira

There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved
woman It is the highest kind of ecstacy

For you too Wanda asked quickly

For me too

And if I should give you that pleasure Wanda exclaimed mockingly

I shall suffer terrible agonies but I shall adore you the more
I replied But you would never deceive me you would have the daemonic
greatness of saying to me I shall love no one but you but I shall
make happy whoever pleases me

Wanda shook her head I don't like deception I am honest but what
man exists who can support the burden of truth Were I say to you
this serene sensual life this paganism is my ideal would you be
strong enough to bear it

Certainly I could endure anything so as not to lose you I feel
how little I really mean to you

But Severin 

But it is so said I and just for that reason 

For that reason you would  she smiled roguishly have I guessed
it

Be your slave I exclaimed Be your unrestricted property
without a will of my own of which you could dispose as you wished
and which would therefore never be a burden to you While you drink
life at its fullness while surrounded by luxury you enjoy the
serene happiness and Olympian love I want to be your servant put
on and take off your shoes

You really aren't so far from wrong replied Wanda for only as
my slave could you endure my loving others Furthermore the freedom
of enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery It
must give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before
one and tremble I want a slave do you hear Severin

Am I not your slave

Then listen to me said Wanda excitedly seizing my hand I want
to be yours as long as I love you

A month

Perhaps even two

And then

Then you become my slave

And you

I Why do you ask I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my
Olympian heights to you softly very softly and secretly

But what does all this mean said Wanda resting her head in both
hands with her gaze lost in the distance a golden fancy which never
can become true An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her
entire being I have never seen her like that

Why unachievable I began

Because slavery doesn't exist any longer

Then we will go to a country where it still exists to the Orient
to Turkey I said eagerly

You would Severin in all seriousness Wanda replied Her eyes
burned

Yes in all seriousness I want to be your slave I continued I
want your power over me to be sanctified by law I want my life to
be in your hands I want nothing that could protect or save me from
you Oh what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent
upon your absolute will your whim at your beck and call And then
what happiness when at some time you deign to be gracious and the
slave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him I knelt
down and leaned my burning forehead against her knee

You are talking as in a fever said Wanda agitatedly and you
really love me so endlessly She held me to her breast and covered
me with kisses

You really want it

I swear to you now by God and my honor that I shall be your slave
wherever and whenever you wish it as soon as you command I
exclaimed hardly master of myself

And if I take you at your word said Wanda

Please do

All this appeals to me she said then It is different from
anything else to know that a man who worships me and whom I love
with all my heart is so wholly mine dependent on my will and
caprice my possession and slave while I 

She looked strangely at me

If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame she
continued It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already but
you have sworn

And I shall keep my oath

I shall see to that she replied I am beginning to enjoy it
and heaven help me we won't stick to fancies now You shall become
my slave and I I shall try to be Venus in Furs

                            

I thought that at last I knew this woman understood her and now I
see I have to begin at the very beginning again Only a little while
ago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile and now she
tries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness

She has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of
honor and agree under oath to be her slave as long as she wishes

With her arm around my neck she reads this unprecedented
incredible document to me The end of each sentence she punctuates
with a kiss

But all the obligations in the contract are on my side I said
teasing her

Of course she replied with great seriousness you cease to be my
lover and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations
towards you You will have to look upon my favors as pure
benevolence You no longer have any rights and no longer can lay
claim to any There can be no limit to my power over you Remember
that you won't be much better than a dog or some inanimate object
You will be mine my plaything which I can break to pieces whenever
I want an hour's amusement You are nothing I am everything Do you
understand She laughed and kissed me again and yet a sort of cold
shiver ran through me

Won't you allow me a few conditions  I began

Conditions She contracted her forehead Ah You are afraid
already or perhaps you regret but it is too late now You have
sworn I have your word of honor But let me hear them

First of all I should like to have it included in our contract
that you will never completely leave me and then that you will never
give me over to the mercies of any of your admirers 

But Severin exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and
with tears in her eyes how can you imagine that I and you a man
who loves me so absolutely who puts himself so entirely in my power 
She halted

No no I said covering her hands with kisses I don't fear
anything from you that might dishonor me Forgive me the ugly
thought

Wanda smiled happily leaned her cheek against mine and seemed to
reflect

You have forgotten something she whispered coquettishly the
most important thing

A condition

Yes that I must always wear my furs exclaimed Wanda But I
promise you I'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic
feeling And I shall be very cruel to you do you understand

Shall I sign the contract I asked

Not yet said Wanda I shall first add your conditions and the
actual signing won't occur until the proper time and place

In Constantinople

No I have thought things over What special value would there be
in owning a slave where everyone owns slaves What I want is to
have a slave I alone here in our civilized sober Philistine
world and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on
account of my beauty and personality not because of law of property
rights or compulsions This attracts me But at any rate we will go
to a country where we are not known and where you can appear before
the world as my servant without embarrassment Perhaps to Italy to
Rome or Naples

                            

We were sitting on Wanda's ottoman She wore her ermine jacket her
hair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back She clung
to my lips drawing my soul from my body My head whirled my blood
began to seethe my heart beat violently against hers

I want to be absolutely in your power Wanda I exclaimed
suddenly seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think
clearly or decide freely I want to put myself absolutely at your
mercy for good or evil without any condition without any limit to
your power

While saying this I had slipped from the ottoman and lay at her
feet looking up at her with drunken eyes

How beautiful you now are she exclaimed your eyes half-broken
in ecstacy fill me with joy carry me away How wonderful your look
would be if you were being beaten to death in the extreme agony You
have the eye of a martyr

                            

Sometimes nevertheless I have an uneasy feeling about placing
myself so absolutely so unconditionally into a woman's hands
Suppose she did abuse my passion her power

Well then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since
my childhood what has always given me the feeling of seductive
terror A foolish apprehension It will be a wanton game she will play
with me nothing more She loves me and she is good a noble
personality incapable of a breach of faith But it lies in her hands
if she wants to she can What a temptation in this doubt this
fear

Now I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier who even
in the pillory while she was another man's mistress still adored
her

Love knows no virtue no profit it loves and forgives and suffers
everything because it must It is not our judgment that leads us
it is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover that
make us abandon ourselves or that repel us

It is a sweet soft enigmatic power that drives us on We cease to
think to feel to will we let ourselves be carried away by it and
ask not whither

                            

A Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade
He aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure
magnificent face and splendid bearing The women particularly gaped
at him as though he were a wild animal but he went his way gloomily
without paying attention to any one He was accompanied by two
servants one a negro completely dressed in red satin and the other
a Circassian in his full gleaming uniform Suddenly he saw Wanda and
fixed his cold piercing look upon her he even turned his head after
her and when she had passed he stood still and followed her with
his eyes

And she she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes and
did everything possible to meet him again

The cunning coquetry with which she walked moved and looked at
him almost stifled me On the way home I remarked about it She knit
her brows

What do you want she said the prince is a man whom I might
like who even dazzles me and I am free I can do what I please 

Don't you love me any longer  I stammered frightened

I love only you she replied but I shall have the prince pay
court to me

Wanda

Aren't you my slave she said calmly Am I not Venus the cruel
northern Venus in Furs

I was silent I felt literally crushed by her words her cold look
entered my heart like a dagger

You will find out immediately the prince's name residence and
circumstances she continued Do you understand

But 

No argument obey exclaimed Wanda more sternly than I would have
thought possible for her and don't dare to enter my sight until you
can answer my questions

It was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired
information for Wanda She let me stand before her like a servant
while she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me smiling
Then she nodded she seemed to be satisfied

Bring me my footstool she commanded shortly

I obeyed and after having put it before her and having put her feet
on it I remained kneeling

How will this end I asked sadly after a short pause

She broke into playful laughter Why things haven't even begun yet

You are more heartless than I imagined I replied hurt

Severin Wanda began earnestly I haven't done anything yet not
the slightest thing and you are already calling me heartless What
will happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization
when I shall lead a gay free life and have a circle of admirers
about me when I shall actually fulfil your ideal tread you
underfoot and apply the lash

You take my dreams too seriously

Too seriously I can't stop at make-believe when once I begin
she replied You know I hate all play-acting and comedy You have
wished it Was it my idea or yours Did I persuade you or did you
inflame my imagination I am taking things seriously now

Wanda I replied caressingly listen quietly to me We love each
other infinitely we are very happy will you sacrifice our entire
future to a whim

It is no longer a whim she exclaimed

What is it I asked frightened

Something that was probably latent in me she said quietly and
thoughtfully Perhaps it would never have come to light if you had
not called it to life and made it grow Now that it has become a
powerful impulse fills my whole being now that I enjoy it now that
I cannot and do not want to do otherwise now you want to back out 
you are you a man

Dear sweet Wanda I began to caress her kiss her

Don't you are not a man 

And you I flared up

I am stubborn she said you know that I haven't a strong
imagination and like you I am weak in execution But when I make up
my mind to do something I carry it through and the more certainly
the more opposition I meet Leave me alone

She pushed me away and got up

Wanda I likewise rose and stood facing her

Now you know what I am she continued Once more I warn you You
still have the choice I am not compelling you to be my slave

Wanda I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes don't
you know how I love you

Her lips quivered contemptuously

You are mistaken you make yourself out worse than you are you are
good and noble by nature 

What do you know about my nature she interrupted vehemently you
will get to know me as I am

Wanda

Decide will you submit unconditionally

And if I say no

Then 

She stepped close up to me cold and contemptuous As she stood
before me now the arms folded across her breast with an evil smile
about her lips she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams Her
expression seemed hard and nothing lay in her eyes that promised
kindness or mercy

Well  she said at last

You are angry I cried you will punish me

Oh no she replied I shall let you go You are free I am not
holding you

Wanda I who love you so 

Yes you my dear sir you who adore me she exclaimed
contemptuously but who are a coward a liar and a breaker of
promises Leave me instantly 

Wanda I 

Wretch

My blood rose in my heart I threw myself down at her feet and began
to cry

Tears too She began to laugh Oh this laughter was frightful
Leave me I don't want to see you again

Oh my God I cried beside myself I will do whatever you
command be your slave a mere object with which you can do what you
will only don't send me away I can't bear it I cannot live without
you I embraced her knees and covered her hand with kisses

Yes you must be a slave and feel the lash for you are not a
man she said calmly She said this to me with perfect composure
not angrily not even excitedly and it was what hurt most Now I
know you your dog-like nature that adores where it is kicked and
the more the more it is maltreated Now I know you and now you
shall come to know me

She walked up and down with long strides while I remained crushed
on my knees my head was hanging supine tears flowed from my eyes

Come here Wanda commanded harshly sitting down on the ottoman
I obeyed her command and sat down beside her She looked at me
sombrely and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior
of her eye Smiling she drew me toward her breast and began to kiss
the tears out of my eyes

                            

The odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily's
park I can escape and don't want to I am ready to endure everything
as soon as she threatens to set me free

                            

If only she would use the whip again There is something uncanny in
the kindness with which she treats me I seem like a little captive
mouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays She is ready at any
moment to tear it to pieces and my heart of a mouse threatens to
burst

What are her intentions What does she purpose to do with me

                            

It seems she has completely forgotten the contract my slavehood Or
was it actually only stubbornness And she gave up her whole plan as
soon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim

How kind she is to me how tender how loving We are spending
marvellously happy days

To-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and
Mephistopheles in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar
Her glance hung on me with strange pleasure

I don't understand she said when I had finished how a man who
can read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression and
interpret them so clearly concisely and intelligently can at the
same time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are

Were you pleased said I and kissed her forehead

She gently stroked my brow I love you Severin she whispered I
don't believe I could ever love any one more than you Let us be
sensible what do you say

Instead of replying I folded her in my arms a deep inward yet
vaguely sad happiness filled my breast my eyes grew moist and a
tear fell upon her hand

How can you cry she exclaimed you are a child

                            

On a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage He
seemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda's side and
looked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his
electric gray eyes She however did not seem to notice him I felt
at that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet
She let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an
inanimate object a tree for instance and turned to me with her
gracious smile

                            

When I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly
unaccountably distracted and moody What was occupying her

I am sorry you are going she said when I was already standing on
the threshold

It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my
trial to cease tormenting me  I pleaded

Do you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me too
Wanda interjected

Then end it I exclaimed embracing her be my wife

Never Severin she said gently but with great firmness

What do you mean

I was frightened in my innermost soul

You are not the man for me

I looked at her and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about
her waist then I left the room and she she did not call me back

                            

A sleepless night I made countless decisions only to toss them
aside again In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared
our relationship dissolved My hand trembled when I put on the seal
and I burned my fingers

As I went upstairs to hand it to the maid my knees threatened to
give way

The door opened and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers

I haven't had my hair dressed yet she said smiling What have
you there

A letter 

For me

I nodded

Ah you want to break with me she exclaimed mockingly

Didn't you tell me yesterday that I wasn't the man for you

I repeat it now

Very well then My whole body was trembling my voice failed me
and I handed her the letter

Keep it she said measuring me coldly You forget that is no
longer a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man as a slave
you will doubtless do well enough

Madame I exclaimed aghast

That is what you will call me in the future replied Wanda
throwing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt Put
your affairs in order within the next twenty-four hours The day
after to-morrow I shall start for Italy and you will accompany me
as my servant

Wanda 

I forbid any sort of familiarity she said cutting my words short
likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you and
you are not to speak to me until you are spoken to From now on your
name is no longer Severin but Gregor

I trembled with rage and yet unfortunately I cannot deny it I
also felt a strange pleasure and stimulation

But madame you know my circumstances I began in my confusion
I am dependent on my father and I doubt whether he will give me the
large sum of money needed for this journey 

That means you have no money Gregor said Wanda delightedly so
much the better you are then entirely dependent on me and in fact
my slave

You don't consider I tried to object that as man of honor it is
impossible for me 

I have indeed considered it she replied almost with a tone of
command As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your
promise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey
whatever I command Now leave me Gregor

I turned toward the door

Not yet you may first kiss my hand She held it out to me with a
certain proud indifference and I the dilettante the donkey the
miserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips
which were dry and hot with excitement

There was another gracious nod of the head

Then I was dismissed

                            

Though it was late in the evening my light was still lit and a fire
was burning in the large green stove There were still many things
among my letters and documents to be put in order Autumn as is
usually the case with us had fallen with all its power

Suddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip

I opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and
in a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great
Catherine favored

Are you ready Gregor she asked darkly

Not yet mistress I replied

I like that word she said then you are always to call me
mistress do you understand We leave here to-morrow morning at nine
o'clock As far as the district capital you will be my companion and
friend but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are
my slave my servant Now close the window and open the door

After I had done as she had demanded and after she had entered she
asked contracting her brows ironically well how do you like me

Wanda you 

Who gave you permission She gave me a blow with the whip

You are very beautiful mistress

Wanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair Kneel down here beside
my chair

I obeyed

Kiss my hand

I seized her small cold hand and kissed it

And the mouth 

In a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel
woman and covered her face arms and breast with glowing kisses
She returned them with equal fervor the eyelids closed as in a
dream It was after midnight when she left

                            

At nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure
as she had ordered We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a
comfortable light carriage The most interesting drama of my life had
reached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible
to foretell

So far everything went well I sat beside Wanda and she chatted
very graciously and intelligently with me as with a good friend
concerning Italy Pisemski's new novel and Wagner's music She wore
a sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short
jacket of the same material set with dark fur It fitted closely and
showed her figure to best advantage Over it she wore dark furs Her
hair wound into an antique knot lay beneath a small dark fur-hat
from which a black veil hung Wanda was in very good humor she fed
me candies played with my hair loosened my neck cloth and made a
pretty cockade of it she covered my knees with her furs and
stealthily pressed the fingers of my hand When our Jewish driver
persistently went on nodding to himself she even gave me a kiss and
her cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal
rose which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and
upon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice

                            

We are at the district capital We get out at the railway station
Wanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm and goes
to secure the tickets

When she returns she has completely changed

Here is your ticket Gregor she says in a tone which supercilious
ladies use to their servants

A third-class ticket I reply with comic horror

Of course she continues but now be careful You won't get on
until I am settled in my compartment and don't need you any longer
At each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders Don't
forget And now give me my furs

After I had helped her into them humbly like a slave she went to
find an empty first-class coupe I followed Supporting herself on
my shoulder she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed
them on the warming bottle

Then she nodded to me and dismissed me I slowly ascended a third-class
carriage which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed
like the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades I now had the leisure
to muse about the riddle of human existence and about its greatest
riddle of all woman

                            

Whenever the train stops I jump off run to her carriage and with
drawn cap await her orders She wants coffee and then a glass of
water at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands and
thus it goes on She lets several men who have entered her
compartment pay court to her I am dying of jealousy and have to leap
about like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and
not miss the train

In this way the night passes I haven't had time to eat a mouthful
and I can't sleep I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish
peasants Jewish peddlers and common soldiers

When I mount the steps of her coupe she is lying stretched out
on cushions in her comfortable furs covered up with the skins of
animals She is like an oriental despot and the men sit like Indian
deities straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to
breathe

                            

She stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping and particularly
to buy series of luxurious gowns She continues to treat me as her
servant I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces She
hands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look
and laden down like a donkey I pant along behind

Before leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel
waiters I am ordered to put on her livery It is a Cracovian costume
in her colors light-blue with red facings and red quadrangular cap
ornamented with peacock-feathers The costume is rather becoming to
me

The silver buttons bear her coat of arms I have the feeling of having
been sold or of having bonded myself to the devil My fair demon leads
me from Vienna to Florence Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and
greasy-haired Jews my companions now are curly-haired Contadini a
magnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers and a poor German
painter The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions but of salami and
cheese

Night has fallen again I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack my arms and
legs seem broken But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the
affair The stars sparkle round about the Italian sergeant has a face
like Apollo Belvedere and the German painter sings a lovely German
song

Now that all the shadows gather
And endless stars grow light
Deep yearning on me falls
And softly fills the night

Through the sea of dreams
Sailing without cease
Sailing goes my soul
In thine to find release

And I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal
comfort among her soft furs

                            

Florence Crowds cries importunate porters and cab-drivers Wanda
chooses a carriage and dismisses the porters

What have I a servant for she says Gregor here is the ticket 
get the luggage

She wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I
drag the heavy trunks hither one after another I break down for a
moment under the last one a good-natured carabiniere with an
intelligent face comes to my assistance She laughs

It must be heavy said she all my furs are in it

I get up on the driver's seat wiping drops of perspiration from my
brow She gives the name of the hotel and the driver urges on his
horse In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated
entrance

Have you any rooms she asks the portier

Yes madame

Two for me one for my servant all with stoves

Two first-class rooms for you madame both with stoves replied
the waiter who had hastily come up and one without heat for your
servant

She looked at them and then abruptly said they are satisfactory
have fires built at once my servant can sleep in the unheated room

I merely looked at her

Bring up the trunks Gregor she commands paying no attention to
my looks In the meantime I'll be dressing and then will go down
to the dining-room and you can eat something for supper

As she goes into the adjoining room I drag the trunks upstairs and
help the waiter build a fire in her bed-room He tries to question
me in bad French about my employer With a brief glance I see the
blazing fire the fragrant white poster-bed and the rugs which cover
the floor Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs and ask for
something to eat A good-natured waiter who used to be in the
Austrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German
shows me the dining-room and waits on me I have just had the first
fresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on
my fork when she enters

I rise

What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my
servant is eating she snaps at the waiter flaring with anger She
turns around and leaves

Meanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating Later
I climb the four flights upstairs to my room My small trunk is
already there and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning It is a
narrow room without fire-place without a window but with a small
air-hole If it weren't so beastly cold it would remind me of one
of the Venetian piombi Footnote These were notorious prisons
under the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges Involuntarily I
have to laugh out aloud so that it re-echoes and I am startled by
my own laughter

Suddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical
Italian gesture calls You are to come down to madame at once I
pick up my cap stumble down the first few steps but finally arrive
in front of her door on the first floor and knock

Come in

I enter shut the door and stand attention

Wanda has made herself comfortable She is sitting in a neglige of
white muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a
footstool that matches She has thrown her fur-cloak about her It
is the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time
as goddess of love

The yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections
their reflections in the large mirrors and the red flames from the
open fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet the dark-brown
sable of the cloak the smooth white skin and the red flaming hair
of the beautiful woman Her clear but cold face is turned toward me
and her cold green eyes rest upon me

I am satisfied with you Gregor she began

I bowed

Come closer

I obeyed

Still closer she looked down and stroked the sable with her
hand Venus in Furs receives her slave I can see that you are more
than an ordinary dreamer you don't remain far in arrears of your
dreams you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into
effect no matter how mad they are I confess I like this it
impresses me There is strength in this and strength is the only
thing one respects I actually believe that under unusual
circumstances in a period of great deeds what seems to be your
weakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power Under the early
emperors you would have been a martyr at the time of the Reformation
an anabaptist during the French Revolution one of those inspired
Girondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their
lips But you are my slave my 

She suddenly leaped up the furs slipped down and she threw her
arms with soft pressure about my neck

My beloved slave Severin oh how I love you how I adore you how
handsome you are in your Cracovian costume You will be cold to-night
up in your wretched room without a fire Shall I give you one of my
furs dear heart the large one there 

She quickly picked it up throwing it over my shoulders and before
I knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it

How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face they bring out your
noble lines As soon as you cease being my slave you must wear a
velvet coat with sable do you understand Otherwise I shall never
put on my fur-jacket again

And again she began to caress me and kiss me finally she drew me
down on the little divan

You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs she said Quick
quick give them to me or I will lose all sense of dignity

I placed the furs about her and Wanda slipped her right arm into
the sleeve

This is the pose in Titian's picture But now enough of joking
Don't always look so solemn it makes me feel sad As far as the
world is concerned you are still merely my servant you are not yet
my slave for you have not yet signed the contract You are still
free and can leave me any moment You have played your part
magnificently I have been delighted but aren't you tired of it
already and don't you think I am abominable Well say something I
command it

Must I confess to you Wanda I began

Yes you must

Even it you take advantage of it I continued I shall love you
the more deeply adore you the more fanatically the worse you treat
me What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my
senses I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her
moist lips

Oh you beautiful woman I then exclaimed looking at her In my
enthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth
against her neck

You love me even when I am cruel said Wanda now go you bore
me don't you hear

She boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears

Help me into my furs slave

I helped her as well as I could

How awkward she exclaimed and was scarcely in it before she
struck me in the face again I felt myself growing pale

Did I hurt you she asked softly touching me with her hand

No no I exclaimed

At any rate you have no reason to complain you want it thus now
kiss me again

I threw my arms about her and her lips clung closely to mine As
she lay against my breast in her large heavy furs I had a curiously
oppressive sensation It was as if a wild beast a she-bear were
embracing me It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my
flesh But this time the she-bear let me off easily

With my heart filled with smiling hopes I went up to my miserable
servant's room and threw myself down on my hard couch

Life is really amazingly droll I thought A short time ago the
most beautiful woman Venus herself rested against your breast and
now you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell Unlike us
they don't hurl the damned into flames but they have devils chasing
them out into fields of ice

Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated
rooms

                            

During the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream I had
been dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way I had been
looking in vain for a way out Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a
sleigh harnessed with reindeer he had the face of the waiter who had
shown me to the unheated room

What are you looking for here my dear sir he exclaimed This is
the North Pole

A moment later he had disappeared and Wanda flew over the smooth
ice on tiny skates Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled the
ermine of her jacket and cap but especially her face gleamed whiter
than the snow She shot toward me inclosed me in her arms and began
to kiss me Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side

What are you doing I asked horror-stricken

She laughed and as I looked at her now it was no longer Wanda but
a huge white she-bear who was digging her paws into my body

I cried out in despair and still heard her diabolical laughter when
I awoke and looked about the room in surprise

Early in the morning I stood at Wanda's door and the waiter brought
the coffee I took it from him and served it to my beautiful
mistress She had already dressed and looked magnificent all fresh
and roseate She smiled graciously at me and called me back when I
was about to withdraw respectfully

Come Gregor have your breakfast quickly too she said then we
will go house-hunting I don't want to stay in the hotel any longer
than I have to It is very embarassing here If I chat with you for
more than a minute people will immediately sayThe fair Russian
is having an affair with her servant you see the race of Catherines
isn't extinct yet'

Half an hour later we went out Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the
Russian cap and I in my Cracovian costume We created quite a stir I
walked about ten paces behind looking very solemn but expected
momentarily to have to break out into loud laughter There was scarcely
a street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear
the sign camere ammobiliate Wanda always sent me upstairs and only
when the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself
ascend By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt

We entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable
habitation Wanda was already somewhat out of humor Suddenly she said
to me Severin the seriousness with which you play your part is
charming and the restrictions which we have placed upon each other are
really annoying me I can't stand it any longer I do love you I must
kiss you Let's go into one of the houses

But my lady  I interposed

Gregor She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few
steps of the dark stair-way then she threw her arms about me with
passionate tenderness and kissed me

Oh Severin you were very wise You are much more dangerous as
slave than I would have imagined you are positively irrestible and
I am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again

Don't you love me any longer then I asked seized by a sudden
fright

She solemnly shook her head but kissed me again with her swelling
adorable lips

We returned to the hotel Wanda had luncheon and ordered me also
quickly to get something to eat

Of course I wasn't served as quickly as she and so it happened
that just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth
the waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture
Madame wants you at once

I took a rapid and painful leave of my food and tired and hungry
hurried toward Wanda who was already on the street

I wouldn't have imagined you could be so cruel I said
reproachfully With all these fatiguing duties you don't even leave
me time to eat in peace

Wanda laughed gaily I thought you had finished she said but
never mind Man was born to suffer and you in particular The
martyrs didn't have any beefsteaks either

I followed her resentfully gnawing at my hunger

I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city Wanda
continued It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is
shut off and where you can do as you please In such a strange mad
relationship as ours there must be no jarring note I shall rent an
entire villa and you will be surprised You have my permission now
to satisfy your hunger and look about a bit in Florence I won't be
home till evening If I need you then I will have you called

I looked at the Duomo the Palazzo Vecchio the Logia di Lanzi and
then I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno Again and
again I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence whose
round cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue
cloudless sky I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide
arches the lively waves of the beautiful yellow river ran and the
green hills which surrounded the city bearing slender cypresses and
extensive buildings palaces and monasteries

It is a different world this one in which we are a gay sensuous
smiling world The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and
somberness of ours It is a long ways off to the last white villas
scattered among the pale green of the mountains and yet there isn't
a spot that isn't bright with sunlight The people are less serious
than we perhaps they think less but they all look as though they
were happy

It is also maintained that death is easier in the South

I have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn
and love of the senses without torment does exist

Wanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the
winter It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the
Arno opposite the Cascine It is surrounded by an attractive garden
with lovely paths grass plots and magnificent meadow of camelias
It is only two stories high quadrangular in the Italian fashion An
open gallery runs along one side a sort of loggia with plaster-casts
of antique statues stone steps lead from it down into the garden
From the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin
from which winding stairs lead to my mistressbed-chamber

Wanda occupies the second story by herself

A room on the ground floor has been assigned to me it is very
attractive and even has a fireplace

I have roamed through the garden On a round hillock I discovered a
little temple but I found its door locked However there is a chink
in the door and when I glue my eye to it I see the goddess of love
on a white pedestal

A slight shudder passes over me It seems to me as if she were
smiling at me saying Are you there I have been expecting you

                            

It is evening An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before
my mistress I ascend the wide marble stairs pass through the
anteroom a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence and
knock at the door of the bedroom I knock very softly for the luxury
displayed everywhere intimidates me Consequently no one hears me
and I stand for some time in front of the door I have a feeling as
if I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine and
it seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping
furs with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast and with
her little white powdered curls

I knocked again Wanda impatiently pulls the door open

Why so late she asks

I was standing in front of the door but you didn't hear me knock
I reply timidly She closes the door and clinging to me she leads
me to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting The
entire arrangement of the room is in red damask wall-paper
curtains portieres hangings of the bed A magnificent painting of
Samson and Delilah forms the ceiling

Wanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille Her white satin
dress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body
leaving her arms and breast bare and carelessly they nestle amid the
dark hair of the great fur of sable lined with green velvet Her red
hair falls down her back as far as the hips only half held by
strings of black pearls

Venus in Furs I whisper while she draws me to her breast and
threatens to stifle me with her kisses Then I no longer speak and
neither do I think everything is drowned out in an ocean of
unimagined bliss

Do you still love me she asks her eye softening in passionate
tenderness

You ask I exclaimed

You still remember your oath she continued with an alluring
smile now that everything is prepared everything in readiness I
ask you once more is it still your serious wish to become my slave

Am I not ready I asked in surprise

You have not yet signed the papers

Papers what papers

Oh I see you want to give it up she said well then we will
let it go

But Wanda I said you know that nothing gives me greater
happiness than to serve you to be your slave I would give
everything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power even
unto death 

How beautiful you are she whispered when you speak so
enthusiastically so passionately I am more in love with you than
ever and you want me to be dominant stern and cruel I am afraid
it will be impossible for me to be so

I am not afraid I replied smiling where are the papers'

So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power I
have drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have
decided to kill yourself In that way I can even kill you if I so
desire

Give them to me

While I was unfolding the documents and reading them Wanda got pen
and ink She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck and
looked over my shoulder at the paper

The first one read

AGREEMENT BETWEEN MME VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI

Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced
of Mme Wanda von Dunajew and renounces all the rights appertaining
thereunto he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a
man and nobleman that hereafter he will be her slave until such
time that she herself sets him at liberty again

As the slave of Mme von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor and
he is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes and to
obey every one of her commands he is always to be submissive to his
mistress and is to consider her every sign of favor as an
extraordinary mercy

Mme von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she
deems best even for the slightest inadvertence or fault but also
is herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her
or merely for the sake of whiling away the time Should she so desire
she may kill him whenever she wishes in short he is her
unrestricted property

Should Mme von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty Severin von
Kusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or
suffered as her slave and promises never under any circumstances and
in no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation

Mme von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as
often as possible in her furs especially when she purposes some
cruelty toward her slave

Appended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present
day

The second document contained only a few words

Having since many years become weary of existence and its
illusions I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless
life

I was seized with a deep horror when I had finished There was still
time I could still withdraw but the madness of passion and the
sight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder
carried me away

This one you will have to copy Severin said Wanda indicating
the second document It has to be entirely in your own handwriting
this of course isn't necessary in the case of the agreement

I quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a
suicide and handed them to Wanda She read them and put them on the
table with a smile

Now have you the courage to sign it she asked with a crafty
smile inclining her head

I took the pen

Let me sign first said Wanda your hand is trembling are you
afraid of the happiness that is to be yours

She took the agreement and pen While engaging in my internal struggle
I looked upward for a moment It occurred to me that the painting on the
ceiling like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools was
utterly unhistorical but this very fact gave it a strange mood which
had an almost uncanny effect on me Delilah an opulent woman with
flaming red hair lay extended half-disrobed in a dark fur-cloak upon
a red ottoman and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and
bound by the Philistines Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of
a diabolical cruelty her eyes half-closed met Samson's and his with
a last look of insane passion cling to hers for already one of his
enemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him

Now  said Wanda Why you are all lost in thought What is the
matter with you everything will remain just as it was even after
you have signed don't you know me yet dear heart

I looked at the agreement Her name was written there in bold
letters I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic
then I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement

You are trembling said Wanda calmly shall I help you

She gently took hold of my hand and my name appeared at the bottom
of the second paper Wanda looked once more at the two documents and
then locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman

Now then give me your passport and money

I took out my wallet and handed it to her She inspected it nodded
and put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled
before her leaning my head against her breast

Suddenly she thrusts me away with her foot leaps up and pulls the
bell-rope In answer to its sound three young slender negresses
enter they are as if carved of ebony and are dressed from head to
foot in red satin each one has a rope in her hand

Suddenly I realize my position and am about to rise Wanda stands
proudly erect her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and
contemptous eyes is turned toward me She stands before me as
mistress commanding gives a sign with her hand and before I really
know what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the
ground and have tied me hand and foot As in the case of one about
to be executed my arms are bound behind my back so that I can
scarcely move

Give me the whip Haydee commands Wanda with unearthly calm

The negress hands it to her mistress kneeling

And now take off my heavy furs she continues they impede me

The negress obeyed

The jacket there Wanda commanded

Haydee quickly brought her the kazabaika set with ermine which lay
on the bed and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful
movements

Now tie him to the pillar here

The negresses lifted me up and twisting a heavy rope around my
body tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which
supported the top of the wide Italian bed

Then they suddenly disappeared as if the earth had swallowed them

Wanda swiftly approached me Her white satin dress flowed behind her
in a long train like silver like moonlight her hair flared like
flames against the white fur of her jacket Now she stood in front
of me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips in her right hand
she held the whip She uttered an abrupt laugh

Now play has come to an end between us she said with heartless
coldness Now we will begin in dead earnest You fool I laugh at you
and despise you you who in your insane infatuation have given
yourself as a plaything to me the frivolous and capricious woman
You are no longer the man I love but my slave at my mercy even
unto life and death

You shall know me

First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness
without having done anything to deserve it so that you may
understand what to expect if you are awkward disobedient or
refractory

With a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve and struck
me across the back

I winced for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh

Well how do you like that she exclaimed

I was silent

Just wait you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip she
threatened and simultaneously began to strike me again

The blows fell quickly in rapid succession with terrific force
upon my back arms and neck I had to grit my teeth not to scream
aloud Now she struck me in the face warm blood ran down but she
laughed and continued her blows

It is only now I understand you she exclaimed It really is a
joy to have some one so completely in one's power and a man at that
who loves you you do love me No Oh I'll tear you to shreds yet
and with each blow my pleasure will grow Now twist like a worm
scream whine You will find no mercy in me

Finally she seemed tired

She tossed the whip aside stretched out on the ottoman and rang

The negresses entered

Untie him

As they loosened the rope I fell to the floor like a lump of wood
The black women grinned showing their white teeth

Untie the rope around his feet

They did it but I was unable to rise

Come over here Gregor

I approached the beautiful woman Never did she seem more seductive
to me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt

One step further Wanda commanded Now kneel down and kiss my
foot

She extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin and I the
supersensual fool pressed my lips upon it

Now you won't lay eyes on me for an entire month Gregor she
said seriously I want to become a stranger to you so you will more
easily adjust yourself to our new relationship In the meantime you
will work in the garden and await my orders Now off with you
slave

                            

A month has passed with monotonous regularity heavy work and a
melancholy hunger hunger for her who is inflicting all these
torments on me

I am under the gardener's orders I help him lop the trees and prune
the hedges transplant flowers turn over the flower beds sweep the
gravel paths I share his coarse food and his hard cot I rise and
go to bed with the chickens Now and then I hear that our mistress
is amusing herself surrounded by admirers Once I heard her gay
laughter even down here in the garden

I seem awfully stupid to myself Was it the result of my present
life or was I so before The month is drawing to a close the day
after to-morrow What will she do with me now or has she forgotten
me and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day

A written order

The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service

Wanda Dunajew

With a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the
following morning and enter the bed-room of my divinity It is still
filled with a pleasant half darkness

Is it you Gregor she asks while I kneel before the fire-place
building a fire I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice I
cannot see her herself she is invisible behind the curtains of the
four-poster bed

Yes my mistress I reply

How late is it

Past nine o'clock

Breakfast

I hasten to get it and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed

Here is breakfast my mistress

Wanda draws back the curtains and curiously enough at the first
glance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair
she seems an absolute stranger a beautiful woman but the beloved
soft lines are gone This face is hard and has an expression of
weariness and satiety

Or is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this

She fixes her green eyes upon me more with curiosity than with
menace perhaps even somewhat pityingly and lazily pulls the dark
sleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder

At this moment she is very charming very maddening and I feel my
blood rising to my head and heart The tray in my hands begins to
sway She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on
the toilet-table

You are awkward slave she says furrowing her brow

I lower my looks to the ground and hold the tray as steadily as
possible She eats her breakfast yawns and stretches her opulent
limbs in the magnificent furs

She has rung I enter

Take this letter to Prince Corsini

I hurry into the city and hand the letter to the Prince He is a
handsome young man with glowing black eyes Consumed with jealousy
I take his answer to her

What is the matter with you she asks with lurking spitefulness
You are very pale

Nothing mistress I merely walked rather fast

At luncheon the prince is at her side and I am condemned to serve
both her and him They joke and I am as if non-existent for both
For a brief moment I see black I was just pouring some Bordeaux into
his glass and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown

How awkward Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face The prince
laughed and she also but I felt the blood rising to my face

After luncheon she drove in the Cascine She has a little carriage
with a handsome brown English horse and holds the reins herself
I sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts and nods with a
smile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her

As I help her out of the carriage she leans lightly on my arm the
contact runs through me like an electric shock She is a wonderful
woman and I love her more than ever

                            

For dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women I
serve but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth

A slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures It makes you
understand very quickly especially when the instruction is by the
way of a small woman's hand

                            

After dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater As she descends the
stairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and
with a diadem of white roses on her hair she is literally stunning
I open the carriage-door and help her in In front of the theater
I leap from the driver's seat and in alighting she leaned on my arm
which trembled under the sweet burden I open the door of her box
and then wait in the vestibule The performance lasts four hours she
receives visits from her cavaliers the while I grit my teeth with
rage

It is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the
last time

Fire she orders abruptly and when the fire-place crackles Tea

When I return with the samovar she has already undressed and with
the aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee

Haydee thereupon leaves

Hand me the sleeping-furs says Wanda sleepily stretching her
lovely limbs I take them from the arm-chair and hold them while she
slowly and lazily slides into the sleeves She then throws herself
down on the cushions of the ottoman

Take off my shoes and put on my velvet slippers

I kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts
Hurry hurry Wanda exclaims you are hurting me just you wait I
will teach you She strikes me with the whip but now the shoe is
off

Now get out Still a kick and then I can go to bed

                            

To-night I accompanied her to a soiree In the entrance-hall she
ordered me to help her out of her furs then with a proud smile
confident of victory she entered the brilliantly illuminated room
I again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts watching hour after
hour run by From time to time the sounds of music reached me when
the door remained open for a moment Several servants tried to start
a conversation with me but soon desisted since I knew only a few
words of Italian

Finally I fell asleep and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a
violent attack of jealousy I was condemned to death and saw myself
strapped on the board the knife fell I felt it on my neck but I
was still alive 

Then the executioner slapped my face

No it wasn't the executioner it was Wanda who stood wrathfully
before me demanding her furs I am at her side in a moment and help
her on with it

There is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs and
in seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in
the precious soft furs and to lift the flowing hair over the collar
When she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her
body still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable It is enough to
drive one mad

                            

Finally a day came when there were neither guests nor theater nor
other company I breathed a sigh of relief Wanda sat in the gallery
reading and apparently had no orders for me At dusk when the
silvery evening mists fell she withdrew I served her at dinner she
ate by herself but had not a look not a syllable for me not even
a slap in the face

I actually desire a slap from her hand Tears fill my eyes and I
feel that she has humiliated me so deeply that she doesn't even find
it worth while to torture or maltreat me any further

Before she goes to bed her bell calls me

You will sleep here to-night I had horrible dreams last night and
am afraid of being alone Take one of the cushions from the ottoman
and lie down on the bearskin at my feet

Then Wanda put out the lights The only illumination in the room was
from a small lamp suspended from the ceiling She herself got into
bed Don't stir so as not to wake me

I did as she had commanded but could not fall asleep for a long
time I saw the beautiful woman beautiful as a goddess lying on her
back on the dark sleeping-furs her arms beneath her neck with a
flood of red hair over them I heard her magnificent breast rise in
deep regular breathing and whenever she moved ever so slightly I
woke up and listened to see whether she needed me

But she did not require me

No task was required of me I meant no more to her than a night-lamp or
a revolver which one places under one's pillow

                            

Am I mad or is she Does all this arise out of an inventive wanton
woman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual
fantasies or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters
who take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot like a worm
human beings who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs

What have I experienced

When I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed Wanda suddenly
placed her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine

What beautiful eyes you have she said softly and especially now
since you suffer Are you very unhappy

I bowed my head and kept silent

Severin do you still love me she suddenly exclaimed
passionately can you still love me

She drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset
the can and cups fell to the floor and the coffee ran over the
carpet

Wanda my Wanda I cried out and held her passionately against me
I covered her mouth face and breast with kisses

It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse
you treat me the more frequently you betray me Oh I shall die of
pain and love and jealousy

But I haven't betrayed you as yet Severin replied Wanda smiling

Not Wanda Don't jest so mercilessly with me I cried Haven't
I myself taken the letter to the Prince 

Of course it was an invitation for luncheon

You have since we have been in Florence 

I have been absolutely faithful to you replied Wanda I swear it
by all that is holy to me All that I have done was merely to fulfill
your dream and it was done for your sake

However I shall take a lover otherwise things will be only half
accomplished and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having
treated you cruelly enough my dear beautiful slave But to-day you
shall be Severin again the only one I love I haven't given away
your clothes They are here in the chest Go and dress as you used
to in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate
Forget everything that has happened since oh you will forget it
easily in my arms I shall kiss away all your sorrows

She began to treat me tenderly like a child to kiss me and caress
me Finally she said with a gracious smile Go now and dress I too
will dress Shall I put on my fur-jacket Oh yes I know now run
along

When I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her
white satin dress and the red kazabaika edged with ermine her hair
was white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond
diadem For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine
the Second but she did not give me much time for reminiscences She
drew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful
hours She was no longer the stern capricious mistress she was
entirely a fine lady a tender sweetheart She showed me photographs
and books which had just appeared and talked about them with so much
intelligence clarity and good taste that I more than once carried
her hand to my lips enraptured She then had me recite several of
Lermontov's poems and when I was all afire with enthusiasm she
placed her small hand gently on mine Her expression was soft and her
eyes were filled with tender pleasure

Are you happy

Not yet

She then leaned back on the cushions and slowly opened her
kazabaika

But I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine
You are driving me mad I stammered

Come

I was already lying in her arms and like a serpent she was kissing
me with her tongue when again she whispered Are you happy

Infinitely I exclaimed

She laughed aloud It was an evil shrill laugh which made cold
shivers run down by back

You used to dream of being the slave the plaything of a beautiful
woman and now you imagine you are a free human being a man my
lover-you fool A sign from me and you are a slave again Down on
your knees

I sank down from the ottoman to her feet but my eye still clung
doubtingly on hers

You can't believe it she said looking at me with her arms folded
across her breast I am bored and you will just do to while away
a couple of hours of time Don't look at me that way 

She kicked me with her foot

You are just what I want a human being a thing an animal 

She rang The three negresses entered

Tie his hands behind his back

I remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this They led me
into the garden down to the little vineyard which forms the
southern boundary Corn had been planted between the espaliers and
here and there a few dead stalks still stood To one side was a
plough

The negresses tied me to a post and amused themselves sticking me
with their golden hair-needles But this did not last long before
Wanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head and with her hands
in the pockets of her jacket She had me untied and then my hands
were fastened together on my back She finally had a yoke put around
my neck and harnessed me to the plough

Then her black demons drove me out into the field One of them held
the plough the other one led me by a line the third applied the
whip and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on

                            

When I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said Bring
another cover I want you to dine with me to-day and when I was
about to sit down opposite her she added No over here close by
my side

She is in the best of humors gives me soup with her spoon feeds me
with her fork and places her head on the table like a playful kitten
and flirts with me I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee who
serves in my place perhaps a little longer than is necessary It is
only now that I noticed her noble almost European cast of
countenance and her magnificent statuesque bust which is as if hewn
out of black marble The black devil observes that she pleases me
and grinning shows her teeth She has hardly left the room before
Wanda leaps up in a rage

What you dare to look at another woman besides me Perhaps you
like her even better than you do me she is even more demonic

I am frightened I have never seen her like this before she is
suddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles Venus in
Furs is jealous of her slave She snatches the whip from its hook and
strikes me in the face then she calls her black servants who bind
me and carry me down into the cellar where they throw me into a
dark dank subterranean compartment a veritable prison-cell

Then the lock of the door clicks the bolts are drawn a key sings
in the lock I am a prisoner buried

I have been lying here for I don't know how long bound like a calf
about to be hauled to the slaughter on a bundle of damp straw
without any light without food without drink without sleep It
would be like her to let me starve to death if I don't freeze to
death before then I am shaking with cold Or is it fever I believe
I am beginning to hate this woman

                            

A red streak like blood floods across the floor it is a light
falling through the door which is now thrust open

Wanda appears on the threshold wrapped in her sables holding a
lighted torch

Are you still alive she asks

Are you coming to kill me I reply with a low hoarse voice

With two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side she kneels down beside
me and places my head in her lap Are you ill Your eyes glow so
do you love me I want you to love me

She draws forth a short dagger I start with fright when its blade
gleams in front of my eyes I actually believe that she is about to
kill me She laughs and cuts the ropes that bind me

                            

Every evening after dinner she now has me called I have to read to
her and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and
subjects She seems entirely transformed it is as if she were
ashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty
with which she treated me A touching gentleness transfigures her
entire being and when at the good-night she gives me her hand a
superhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes of the kind
which calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the
miseries of existence and all the terrors of death

                            

I am reading Manon l'Escault to her She feels the association she
doesn't say a word but she smiles from time to time and finally she
shuts up the little book

Don't you want to go on reading

Not to-day We will ourselves act Manon l'Escault to-day I have a
rendezvous in the Cascine and you my dear Chevalier will accompany
me I know you will do it won't you

You command it

I do not command it I beg it of you she says with irresistible
charm She then rises puts her hands on my shoulders and looks at
me

Your eyes she exclaims I love you Severin you have no idea
how I love you

Yes I have I replied bitterly so much so that you have
arranged for a rendezvous with some one else

I do this only to allure you the more she replied vivaciously I
must have admirers so as not to lose you I don't ever want to lose
you never do you hear for I love only you you alone

She clung passionately to my lips

Oh if I only could as I would give you all of my soul in a kiss 
thus but now come

She slipped into a simple black velvet coat and put a dark bashlyk
Footnote A kind of Russian cap on her head Then she rapidly went
through the gallery and entered the carriage

Gregor will drive she called out to the coachman who withdrew in
surprise

I ascended the driver's seat and angrily whipped up the horses

In the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path Wanda
got out It was night only occasional stars shone through the gray
clouds that fled across the sky By the bank of the Arno stood a man
in a dark cloak with a brigand's hat and looked at the yellow
waves Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery and tapped him on
the shoulder I saw him turn and seize her hand and then they
disappeared behind the green wall

An hour full of torments Finally there was a rustling in the bushes
to one side and they returned

The man accompanied her to the carriage The light of the lamp fell
full and glaringly upon an infinitely young soft and dreamy face
which I had never before seen and played in his long blond curls

She held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect then she
signaled to me and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy
wall which follows the river like a long green screen

                            

The bell at the garden-gate rings It is a familiar face The man
from the Cascine

Whom shall I announce I ask him in French He timidly shakes his
head

Do you perhaps understand some German he asks shyly

Yes Your name please

Oh I haven't any yet he replies embarrassed Tell your
mistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like 
but there she is herself

Wanda had stepped out on the balcony and nodded toward the stranger

Gregor show the gentleman in she called to me

I showed the painter the stairs

Thanks I'll find her now thanks thanks very much He ran up the
steps I remained standing below and looked with deep pity on the
poor German

Venus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair He will
paint her and go mad

                            

It is a sunny winter's day Something that looks like gold trembles
on the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level
of the meadow The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious
in their abundant buds Wanda is sitting in the loggia she is
drawing The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded
as in adoration and looks at her No he rather looks at her face
and is entirely absorbed in it enraptured

But she does not see him neither does she see me who with the
spade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed solely that I may
see her and feel her nearness which produces an effect on me like
poetry like music

                            

The painter has gone It is a hazardous thing to do but I risk it
I go up to the gallery quite close and ask Wanda Do you love the
painter mistress

She looks at me without getting angry shakes her head and finally
even smiles

I feel sorry for him she replies but I do not love him I love no
one I used to love you as ardently as passionately as deeply as
it was possible for me to love but now I don't love even you any
more my heart is a void dead and this makes me sad

Wanda I exclaimed deeply moved

Soon you too will no longer love me she continued tell me when
you have reached that point and I will give back to you your
freedom

Then I shall remain your slave all my life long for I adore you
and shall always adore you I cried seized by that fanaticism of
love which has repeatedly been so fatal to me

Wanda looked at me with a curious pleasure Consider well what you
do she said I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic
towards you so that I might fulfil your dream Something of my old
feeling a sort of real sympathy for you still trembles in my
breast When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give
you your liberty whether I shall not then become really cruel
merciless even brutal toward whether I shall not take a diabolical
pleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships
me idolatrously the while I remain indifferent or love someone else
perhaps I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me Consider
this well

I have long since considered all that I replied as in a glow of
fever I cannot exist cannot live without you I shall die if you
set me at liberty let me remain your slave kill me but do not
drive me away

Very well then be my slave she replied but don't forget that
I no longer love you and your love doesn't mean any more to me than
a dog's and dogs are kicked



To-day I visited the Venus of Medici

It was still early and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was
filled with half-lights like a sanctuary I stood with folded hands
in deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity

But I did not stand for long

Not a human soul was in the gallery not even an Englishman and I
fell down on my knees I looked up at the lovely slender body the
budding breasts the virginal and yet voluptuous face the fragrant
curls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead

                            

My mistress's bell

It is noonday She however is still abed with her arms intertwined
behind her neck

I want to bathe she says and you will attend me Lock the door

I obey

Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked

I descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the
bath my feet gave way beneath me and I had to support myself
against the iron banister After having ascertained that the door
leading to the Loggia and the garden was locked I returned Wanda
was now sitting on the bed with loosened hair wrapped in her green
velvet furs When she made a rapid movement I noticed that the furs
were her only covering It made me start terribly I don't know why
I was like one condemned to death who knows he is on the way to the
scaffold and yet begins to tremble when he sees it

Come Gregor take me on your arms

You mean mistress

You are to carry me don't you understand

I lifted her up so that she rested in my arms while she twined
hers around my neck Slowly step by step I went down the stairs
with her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her
foot sought support against my knee I trembled under the beautiful
burden I was carrying and every moment it seemed as if I had to
break down beneath it

The bath consisted of a wide high rotunda which received a soft
quiet light from a red glass cupola above Two palms extended their
broad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions From here
steps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which
occupied the center

There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs said Wanda
as I let her down on the couch go get it and also bring the whip

I flew upstairs and back again and kneeling put both in my mistress's
hands She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot
which I fastened with the green ribbon Then I prepared the bath I did
this very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me Again
and again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet
cushions and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and
there beneath the furs Some magnetic power stronger than my will
compelled me to look I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in
that which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed and the truth
of this I recognized even more acutely when the basin at last was full
and Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture and stood
before me like the goddess in the Tribuna

At that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled
beauty as did the divinity of long ago I sank down on my knees
before her and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot

My soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier
suddenly was perfectly calm and I now felt no element of cruelty in
Wanda

She slowly descended the stairs and I could watch her with a
calmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was
intermingled I could see her plunge into and rise out of the
crystalline water and the wavelets which she herself raised played
about her like tender lovers

Our nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says a real apple is
more beautiful than a painted one and a living woman is more
beautiful than a Venus of stone

And when she left the bath and the silvery drops and the roseate
light rippled down her body I was seized with silent rapture I
wrapped the linen sheets about her drying her glorious body The
calm bliss remained with me even now when one foot upon me as upon
a footstool she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak
The lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body
Her left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan
in the dark fur of the sleeve while her left hand played carelessly
with the whip

By chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite
and I cried out for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in
a picture The picture was so marvellously beautiful so strange so
imaginative that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that
its lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist

What is the matter asked Wanda

I pointed to the mirror

Ah that is really beautiful she exclaimed too bad one can't
capture the moment and make it permanent

And why not I asked Would not any artist even the most famous
be proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by
means of his brush

The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to
the world I continued still watching her enthusiastically is
horrible all this glorious facial expression this mysterious eye
with its green fires this demonic hair this magnificence of body
The idea fills me with a horror of death of annihilation But the
hand of an artist shall snatch you from this You shall not like the
rest of us disappear absolutely and forever without leaving a trace
of your having been Your picture must live even when you yourself
have long fallen to dust your beauty must triumph beyond death

Wanda smiled

Too bad that present-day Italy hasn't a Titian or Raphael she
said but perhaps love will make amends for genius who knows our
little German might do She pondered

Yes he shall paint you and I will see to it that the god of love
mixes his colors

                            

The young painter has established his studio in her villa he is
completely in her net He has just begun a Madonna a Madonna with
red hair and green eyes Only the idealism of a German would attempt
to use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of
virginity The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I
am Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass's ears
too soon

                            

Now she laughs derisively at us and how she laughs I hear her
insolent melodious laughter in his studio under the open window of
which I stand jealously listening

                            

Are you mad me ah it is unbelievable me as the Mother of God
she exclaimed and laughed again Wait a moment I will show you
another picture of myself one that I myself have painted and you
shall copy it

Her head appeared in the window luminous like a flame under the
sunlight

Gregor

I hurried up the stairs through the gallery into the studio

Lead him to the bath Wanda commanded while she herself hurried
away

A few moments passed and Wanda arrived dressed in nothing but the
sable fur with the whip in her hand she descended the stairs and
stretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion I lay
at her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me her right hand
played with the whip Look at me she said with your deep
fanatical look that's it

The painter had turned terribly pale He devoured the scene with his
beautiful dreamy blue eyes his lips opened but he remained dumb

Well how do you like the picture

Yes that is how I want to paint you said the German but it was
really not a spoken language it was the eloquent moaning the
weeping of a sick soul a soul sick unto death

                            

The charcoal outline of the painting is done the heads and flesh
parts are painted in Her diabolical face is already becoming visible
under a few bold strokes life flashes in her green eyes

Wanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her
breast

This picture like many of those of the Venetian school is
simultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story
explained the painter who again had become pale as death

And what will you call it she asked but what is the matter with
you are you ill

I am afraid  he answered with a consuming look fixed on the
beautiful woman in furs but let us talk of the picture

Yes let us talk about the picture

I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus
for the sake of some mortal man And always cold in this modern world
of ours she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur
and her feet in the lap of her lover I imagine the favorite of a
beautiful despot who whips her slave when she is tired of kissing
him and the more she treads him underfoot the more insanely he loves
her And so I shall call the picture Venus in Furs

                            

The painter paints slowly but his passion grows more and more
rapidly I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide She plays
with him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve and he
feels his blood congealing in the process but it amuses her

During the sitting she nibbles at candies and rolls the paper-wrappers
into little pellets with which she bombards him

I am glad you are in such good humor said the painter but your face
has lost the expression which I need for my picture

The expression which you need for your picture she replied
smiling Wait a moment

She rose and dealt me a blow with the whip The painter looked at
her with stupefaction and a child-like surprise showed on his face
mingled with disgust and admiration

While whipping me Wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruel
contemptuous character which so haunts and intoxicates me

Is this the expression you need for your picture she exclaimed
The painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her
eye

It is the expression  he stammered but I can't paint now 

What said Wanda scornfully perhaps I can help you

Yes  cried the German as if taken with madness whip me too

Oh With pleasure she replied shrugging her shoulders but if
I am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest

Whip me to death cried the painter

Will you let me tie you she asked smiling

Yes  he moaned 

Wanda left the room for a moment and returned with ropes

Well are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of
Venus in Furs the beautiful despot for better or worse she began
ironically

Yes tie me the painter replied dully Wanda tied his hands on
his back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his
body and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window Then she
rolled back the fur seized the whip and stepped in front of him

The scene had a grim attraction for me which I cannot describe I
felt my heart beat when with a smile she drew back her arm for the
first blow and the whip hissed through the air He winced slightly
under the blow Then she let blow after blow rain upon him with her
mouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips until
he finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous blue eyes It
was indescribable

                            

She is sitting for him now alone He is working on her head

She has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain
where I can't be seen but can see everything

What does she intend now

Is she afraid of him She has driven him insane enough to be sure
or is she hatching a new torment for me My knees tremble

They are talking He has lowered his voice so that I cannot
understand a word and she replies in the same way What is the
meaning of this Is there an understanding between them

I suffer frightful torments my heart seems about to burst

He kneels down before her embraces her and presses his head
against her breast and she in her heartlessness laughs and now
I hear her saying aloud

Ah You need another application of the whip

Woman Goddess Are you without a heart can't you love exclaimed
the German don't you even know what it means to love to be
consumed with desire and passion can't you even imagine what I
suffer Have you no pity for me

No she replied proudly and mockingly but I have the whip

She drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat and struck him
in the face with the handle He rose and drew back a couple of paces

Now are you ready to paint again she asked indifferently He did
not reply but again went to the easel and took up his brush and
palette

The painting is marvellously successful It is a portrait which as
far as the likeness goes couldn't be better and at the same time it
seems to have an ideal quality The colors glow are supernatural
almost diabolical I would call them

The painter has put all his sufferings his adoration and all his
execration into the picture

                            

Now he is painting me we are alone together for several hours every
day To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said

You love this woman

Yes

I also love her His eyes were bathed in tears He remained silent
for a while and continued painting

We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells he
murmured to himself She is a demon

                            

The picture is finished She insisted on paying him for it
munificently in the manner of queens

Oh you have already paid me he said with a tormented smile
refusing her offer

Before he left he secretly opened his portfolio and let me look
inside I was startled Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror
and seemed actually to be alive

I shall take it along he said it is mine she can't take it
away from me I have earned it with my heart's blood

                            

I am really rather sorry for the poor painter she said to me to-day
it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am Don't you think so too

I did not dare to reply to her

Oh I forgot that I am talking with a slave I need some fresh air
I want to be diverted I want to forget

The carriage quick

Her new dress is extravagant Russian half-boots of violet-blue
velvet trimmed with ermine and a skirt of the same material
decorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs Above it is an
appropriate close-fitting jacket also richly trimmed and lined with
ermine The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of
Catherine the Second with a small aigrette held in place by a
diamond-agraffe her red hair falls loose down her back She ascends
on the driver's seat and holds the reins herself I take my seat
behind How she lashes on the horses The carriage flies along like
mad

Apparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day to make
conquests and she succeeds completely She is the lioness of the
Cascine People nod to her from carriages on the footpath people
gather in groups to discuss her She pays no attention to anyone
except now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen
with a slight nod

Suddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed
As soon as he sees Wanda he stops his horse and makes it walk When
he is quite close he stops entirely and lets her pass And she too
sees him the lioness the lion Their eyes meet She madly drives
past him but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of
his look and she turns her head after him

My heart stops when I see the half-surprised half-enraptured look
with which she devours him but he is worthy of it

For he is indeed a magnificent specimen of man No rather he is
a man whose like I have never yet seen among the living He is in the
Belvedere graven in marble with the same slender yet steely
musculature with the same face and the same waving curls What makes
him particularly beautiful is that he is beardless If his hips were
less narrow one might take him for a woman in disguise The curious
expression about the mouth the lion's lip which slightly discloses
the teeth beneath lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful
face 

Apollo flaying Marsyas

He wears high black boots closely fitting breeches of white
leather short fur coat of black cloth of the kind worn by Italian
cavalry officers trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops on his
black locks is a red fez

I now understand the masculine Eros and I marvel at Socrates for
having remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this

                            

I have never seen my lioness so excited Her cheeks flamed when she
left from the carriage at her villa She hurried upstairs and with
an imperious gesture ordered me to follow

Walking up and down her room with long strides she began to talk so
rapidly that I was frightened

You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was immediately 

Oh what a man Did you see him What do you think of him Tell me

The man is beautiful I replied dully

He is so beautiful she paused supporting herself on the arm of
a chair that he has taken my breath away

I can understand the impression he has made on you I replied my
imagination carrying me away in a mad whirl I am quite lost in
admiration myself and I can imagine 

You may imagine she laughed aloud that this man is my lover
and that he will apply the lash to you and that you will enjoy being
punished by him

But now go go

                            

Before evening fell I had the desired information

Wanda was still fully dressed when I returned She reclined on the
ottoman her face buried in her hands her hair in a wild tangle
like the red mane of a lioness

What is his name she asked uncanny calm

Alexis Papadopolis

A Greek then

I nodded

He is very young

Scarcely older than you They say he was educated in Paris and
that he is an atheist He fought against the Turks in Candia and is
said to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred
and cruelty than by his bravery

All in all then a man she cried with sparkling eyes

At present he is living in Florence I continued he is said to
be tremendously rich 

I didn't ask you about that she interrupted quickly and sharply
The man is dangerous Aren't you afraid of him I am afraid of him
Has he a wife

No

A mistress

No

What theaters does he attend

To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater where Virginia Marini
and Salvini are acting they are the greatest living artists in
Italy perhaps in Europe

See that you get a box and be quick about it she commanded

But mistress 

Do you want a taste of the whip

                            

You can wait down in the lobby she said when I had placed the
opera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted
the footstool

I am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so
as not to fall down with envy and rage no rage isn't the right
word it was a mortal fear

I saw her in her box dressed in blue moire with a huge ermine cloak
about her bare shoulders he sat opposite I saw them devour each
other with their eyes For both of them the stage Goldoni's Pamela
Salvini Marini the public even the entire world were non-existant
to-night And I what was I at that moment 

                            

To-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador's Does she
know that she will meet him there

At any rate she dressed as if she did A heavy sea-green silk dress
plastically encloses her divine form leaving the bust and arms bare In
her hair which is done into a single flaming knot a white water-lily
blossoms from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose
strands fall down toward her neck There no longer is any trace of
agitation or trembling feverishness in her being She is calm so calm
that I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her
glance Slowly with a weary indolent majesty she ascends the marble
staircase lets her precious wrap slide off and listlessly enters the
hall where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist

For a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze then I pick up her
furs which without my being aware had slipped from my hands They
are still warm from her shoulders

I kiss the spot and my eyes fill with tears

                            

He has arrived

In his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable he is a
beautiful haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men
He stands in the ante-room looking around proudly and his eyes rest
on me for an uncomfortably long time

Under his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear I have a
presentiment that this man can enchain her captivate her subjugate
her and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity I
am filled with envy with jealousy

I feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains merely And what
is most humiliating I want to hate him but I can't Why is that
among all the host of servants he has chosen me

With an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to
him and I I obey his call against my own will

Take my furs he quickly commands

My entire body trembles with resentment but I obey abjectly like
a slave

                            

All night long I waited in the ante-room raving as in a fever
Strange images hovered past my inner eye I saw their meeting their
long exchange of looks I saw her float through the hall in his arms
drunken lying with half-closed lids against his breast I saw him
in the holy of holies of love lying on the ottoman not as slave
but as master and she at his feet On my knees I served them the
tea-tray faltering in my hands and I saw him reach for the whip
But now the servants are talking about him

He is a man who is like a woman he knows that he is beautiful and
he acts accordingly He changes his clothes four or five times a day
like a vain courtesan

In Paris he appeared first in woman's dress and the men assailed
him with love-letters An Italian singer famous equally for his art
and his passionate intensity even invaded his home and lying on his
knees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn't be his

I am sorry he replied smiling I should like to do you the
favor but you will have to carry out your threat for I am a man

                            

The drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree but she
apparently has no thought of leaving

Morning is already peering through the blinds

At last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along
behind her like green waves She advances step by step engaged in
conversation with him

I hardly exist for her any longer she doesn't even trouble to give
me an order

The cloak for madame he commands He of course doesn't think of
looking after her himself

While I put her furs about her he stands to one side with his arms
crossed While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes she
lightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder She asks

And what about the lioness

When the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is
attacked by another the Greek went on with his narrative the
lioness quietly lies down and watches the battle Even if her mate
is worsted she does not go to his aid She looks on indifferently as
he bleeds to death under his opponent's claws and follows the victor
the stronger that is the female's nature

At this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me

It made me shudder though I didn't know why and the red dawn
immerses me and her and him in blood

                            

She did not go to bed but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid
her hair then she ordered me to build a fire and she sat by the
fire-place and stared into the flames

Do you need me any longer mistress I asked my voice failed me
at the last word

Wanda shook her head

I left the room passed through the gallery and sat down on one of
the steps leading from there down into the garden A gentle north
wind brought a fresh damp coolness from the Arno the green hills
extended into the distance in a rosy mist a golden haze hovered over
the city over the round cupola of the Duomo

A few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky

I tore open my coat and pressed my burning forehead against the
marble Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere
child's play but now things were beginning to be serious terribly
serious

I anticipated a catastrophe I visualized it I could lay hold of it
with my hands but I lacked the courage to meet it My strength was
broken And if I am honest with myself neither the pains and
sufferings that threatened me not the humiliations that impended
were the thing that frightened me

I merely felt a fear the fear of losing her whom I loved with a
sort of fanatical devotion but it was so overwhelming so crushing
that I suddenly began to sob like a child

                            

During the day she remained locked in her room and had the negress
attend her When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky I saw
her pass through the garden and carefully following her at a
distance watched her enter the shrine of Venus I stealthily
followed and peered through the chink in the door

She stood before the divine image of the goddess her hands folded
as in prayer and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue
rays over her

                            

On my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such
powerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me I
lighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath
a saint's image and entered her bedroom covering the light with one
hand

The lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted She
had fallen asleep among her pillows lying on her back her hands
clenched breathing heavily A dream seemed to oppress her I slowly
withdrew my hand and let the red light fall full on her wonderful
face

But she did not awaken

I gently set the lamp on the floor sank down beside Wanda's bed
and rested my head on her soft glowing arm

She moved slightly but even now did not awaken I do not know how
long I lay thus in the middle of the night turned as into a stone
by horrible torments

Finally a severe trembling seized me and I was able to cry My
tears flowed over her arm She quivered several times and finally sat
up she brushed her hand across her eyes and looked at me

Severin she exclaimed more frightened than angry

I was unable to reply

Severin she continued softly what is the matter Are you ill

Her voice sounded so sympathetic so kind so full of love that it
clutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud

Severin she began anew My poor unhappy friend Her hand gently
stroked my hair I am sorry very sorry for you but I can't help
you with the best intention in the world I know of nothing that
would cure you

Oh Wanda must it be I moaned in my agony

What Severin What are you talking about

Don't you love me any more I continued Haven't you even a
little bit of pity for me Has the beautiful stranger taken complete
possession of you

I cannot lie she replied softly after a short pause He has made
an impression on me which I haven't yet been able to analyse further
than that I suffer and tremble beneath it It is an impression of the
sort I have met with in the works of poets or on the stage but I
always thought it was a figment of the imagination Oh he is a man
like a lion strong and beautiful and yet gentle not brutal like the
men of our northern world I am sorry for you Severin I am but I
must possess him What am I saying I must give myself to him if he
will have me

Consider your reputation Wanda which so far has remained
spotless I exclaimed even if I no longer mean anything to you

I am considering it she replied I intend to be strong as long
as it is possible I want  she buried her head shyly in the pillows
I want to become his wife if he will have me

Wanda I cried seized again by that mortal fear which always
robs me of my breath makes me lose possession of myself you want
to be his wife belong to him for always Oh Do not drive me away
He does not love you 

Who says that she exclaimed flaring up

He does not love you I went on passionately but I love you I
adore you I am your slave I let you tread me underfoot I want to
carry you on my arms through life

Who says that he doesn't love me she interrupted vehemently

Oh be mine I replied be mine I cannot exist cannot live
without you Have mercy on me Wanda have mercy

She looked at me again and her face had her cold heartless
expression her evil smile

You say he doesn't love me she said scornfully Very well then
get what consolation you can out of it

With this she turned over on the other side and contemptuously
showed me her back

Good God are you a woman without flesh or blood haven't you a
heart as well as I I cried while my breast heaved convulsively

You know what I am she replied coldly I am a woman of stone
Venus in Furs your ideal kneel down and pray to me

Wanda I implored mercy

She began to laugh I buried my face in her pillows Pain had
loosened the floodgates of my tears and I let them flow

For a long time silence reigned then Wanda slowly raised herself

You bore me she began

Wanda

I am tired let me go to sleep

Mercy I implored Do not drive me away No man no one will
love you as I do

Let me go to sleep she turned her back to me again

I leaped up and snatched the poinard which hung beside her bed
from its sheath and placed its point against my breast

I shall kill myself here before your eyes I murmured dully

Do what you please Wanda replied with complete indifference But
let me go to sleep She yawned aloud I am very sleepy

For a moment I stood as if petrified Then I began to laugh and cry
at the same time Finally I placed the poinard in my belt and again
fell on my knees before her

Wanda listen to me only for a few moments I begged

I want to go to sleep Don't you hear she cried leaping angrily
out of bed and pushing me away with her foot You forget that I am
your mistress When I didn't budge she seized the whip and struck
me I rose she struck me again this time right in the face

Wretch slave

With clenched fist held heavenward I left her bedroom with a sudden
resolve She tossed the whip aside and broke out into clear
laughter I can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been
very droll

                            

I have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman who
has treated me so cruelly and is now about to break faith and betray
me as a reward for all my slavish devotion for everything I have
suffered from her I packed my few belongings into a bundle and then
wrote her as follows

Dear Madam 

I have loved you even to madness I have given myself to you as no man
ever has given himself to a woman You have abused my most sacred
emotions and played an impudent frivolous game with me However as
long as you were merely cruel and merciless it was still possible for
me to love you Now you are about to become cheap I am no longer
the slave whom you can kick about and whip You yourself have set me
free and I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise

Severin Kusiemski

I handed these lines to the negress and hastened away as fast as I
could go I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath
Suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped I began to
weep It is humiliating that I want to flee and I can't I turn back 
whither to her whom I abhor and yet at the same time adore

Again I pause I cannot go back I dare not

But how am I to leave Florence I remember that I haven't any money
not a penny Very well then on foot it is better to be an honest
beggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan

But still I can't leave

She has my pledge my word of honor I have to return Perhaps she
will release me

After a few rapid strides I stop again

She has my word of honor and my bond that I shall remain her slave
as long as she desires until she herself gives me my freedom But
I might kill myself

I go through the Cascine down to the Arno where its yellow waters
plash monotonously about a couple of stray willows There I sit and
cast up my final accounts with existence I let my entire life pass
before me in review On the whole it is rather a wretched affair a
few joys an endless number of indifferent and worthless things and
between these an abundant harvest of pains miseries fears
disappointments shipwrecked hopes afflictions sorrow and grief

I thought of my mother whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to
watch waste away beneath a horrible disease of my brother who full
of the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth
without even having put his lips to the cup of life I thought of my
dead nurse my childhood playmates the friends that had striven and
studied with me of all those covered by the cold dead indifferent
earth I thought of my turtle-dove who not infrequently made his
cooing bows to me instead of to his mate All have returned dust
unto dust

I laughed aloud and slid down into the water but at the same
moment I caught hold of one of the willow-branches hanging above the
yellow waves As in a vision I see the woman who has caused all my
misery She hovers above the level of the water luminous in the
sunlight as though she were transparent with red flames about her
head and neck She turns her face toward me and smiles

                            

I am back again dripping wet through glowing with shame and
fever The negress has delivered my letter I am judged lost in the
power of a heartless affronted woman

Well let her kill me I am unable to do it myself and yet I have
no wish to go on living

As I walk around the house she is standing in the gallery leaning
over the railing Her face is full in the light of the sun and her
green eyes sparkle

Still alive she asked without moving I stood silent with bowed
head

Give me back my poinard she continued It is of no use to you
You haven't even the courage to take your own life

I have lost it I replied trembling shaken by chills

She looked me over with a proud scornful glance

I suppose you lost it in the Arno She shrugged her shoulders No
matter Well and why didn't you leave

I mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand

Oh you haven't any money she cried Here With an
indescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse

I did not pick it up

Both of us were silent for some time

You don't want to leave then

I can't

                            

Wanda drives in the Cascine without me and goes to the theater
without me she receives company and the negress serves her No one
asks after me I stray about the garden irresolutely like an animal
that has lost its master

Lying among the bushes I watch a couple of sparrows fighting over
a seed

Suddenly I hear the swish of a woman's dress

Wanda approaches in a gown of dark silk modestly closed up to the
neck the Greek is with her They are in an eager discussion but I
cannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying He stamps
his foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions and he
lashes the air with his riding whip Wanda startles

Is she afraid that he will strike her

Have they gone that far

He has left her she calls him he does not hear her does not want
to hear her

Wanda sadly lowers her head and then sits down on the nearest
stone-bench She sits for a long time lost in thought I watch her with
a sort of malevolent pleasure finally I pull myself together by sheer
force of will and ironically step before her She startles and
trembles all over

I come to wish you happiness I said bowing I see my dear
lady too has found a master

Yes thank God she exclaimed not a new slave I have had enough
of them A master Woman needs a master and she adores him

You adore him Wanda I cried this brutal person 

Yes I love him as I have never loved any one else

Wanda I clenched my fists but tears already filled my eyes and
I was seized by the delirium of passion as by a sweet madness Very
well take him as your husband let him be your master but I want
to remain your slave as long as I live

You want to remain my slave even then she said that would be
interesting but I am afraid he wouldn't permit it

He

Yes he is already jealous of you she exclaimed he of you He
demanded that I dismiss you immediately and when I told him who you
were 

You told him  I repeated thunderstruck

I told him everything she replied our whole story all your
queerness everything and he instead of being amused grew angry
and stamped his foot

And threatened to strike you

Wanda looked to the ground and remained silent

Yes indeed I said with mocking bitterness you are afraid of
him Wanda I threw myself down at her feet and in my agitation
embraced her knees I don't want anything of you except to be your
slave to be always near you I will be your dog-

Do you know you bore me said Wanda indifferently

I leaped up Everything within me was seething

You are now no longer cruel but cheap I said clearly and
distinctly accentuating every word

You have already written that in your letter Wanda replied with
a proud shrug of the shoulders A man of brains should never repeat
himself

The way you are treating me I broke out what would you call it

I might punish you she replied ironically but I prefer this
time to reply with reasons instead of lashes You have no right to
accuse me Haven't I always been honest with you Haven't I warned
you more than once Didn't I love you with all my heart even
passionately and did I conceal the fact from you that it was
dangerous to give yourself into my power to abase yourself before
me and that I want to be dominated But you wished to be my
plaything my slave You found the highest pleasure in feeling the
foot the whip of an arrogant cruel woman What do you want now

Dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me but you were the
first to awaken them If I now take pleasure in torturing you
abusing you it is your fault you have made of me what I now am and
now you are even unmanly weak and miserable enough to accuse me

Yes I am guilty I said but haven't I suffered because of it
Let us put an end now to the cruel game

That is my wish too she replied with a curious deceitful look

Wanda I exclaimed violently don't drive me to extremes you see
that I am a man again

A fire of straw she replied which makes a lot of stir for a
moment and goes out as quickly as it flared up You imagine you can
intimidate me and you only make yourself ridiculous Had you been
the man I first thought you were serious reserved stern I would
have loved you faithfully and become your wife Woman demands that
she can look up to a man but one like you who voluntarily places his
neck under her foot she uses as a welcome plaything only to toss
it aside when she is tired of it

Try to toss me aside I said jeeringly Some toys are dangerous

Don't challenge me exclaimed Wanda Her eyes began to flash and
a flush entered her cheeks

If you won't be mine now I continued with a voice stifled with
rage no one else shall possess you either

What play is this from she mocked seizing me by the breast She
was pale with anger at this moment Don't challenge me she
continued I am not cruel but I don't know whether I may not become
so and whether then there will be any bounds

What worse can you do than to make your lover your husband I
exclaimed more and more enraged

I might make you his slave she replied quickly are you not in
my power Haven't I the agreement But of course you will merely
take pleasure in it if I have you bound and say to him

Do with him what you please

Woman are you mad I cried

I am entirely rational she said calmly I warn you for the last
time Don't offer any resistance one who has gone as far as I have
gone might easily go still further I feel a sort of hatred for you
and would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death I am still
restraining myself but 

Scarcely master of myself any longer I seized her by the wrist and
forced her to the ground so that she lay on her knees before me

Severin she cried Rage and terror were painted on her face

I shall kill you if you marry him I threatened the words came
hoarsely and dully from my breast You are mine I won't let you go
I love you too much Then I clutched her and pressed her close to
me my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had
in my belt

Wanda fixed a large calm incomprehensible look on me

I like you that way she said carelessly Now you are a man and
at this moment I know I still love you

Wanda I wept with rapture and bent down over her covering her
dear face with kisses and she suddenly breaking into a loud gay
laugh said Have you finished with your ideal now are you
satisfied with me

You mean I stammered that you weren't serious

I am very serious she gaily continued I love you only you and
you you foolish little man didn't know that everything was only
make-believe and play-acting How hard it often was for me to strike
you with the whip when I would have rather taken your head and
covered it with kisses But now we are through with that aren't we
I have played my cruel role better than you expected and now you
will be satisfied with my being a good little wife who isn't
altogether unattractive Isn't that so We will live like rational
people 

You will marry me I cried overflowing with happiness

Yes marry you you dear darling man whispered Wanda kissing my
hands

I drew her up to my breast

Now you are no longer Gregor my slave said she but Severin
the dear man I love 

And he you don't love him I asked in agitation

How could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type You were
blind to everything I was really afraid for you

I almost killed myself for your sake

Really she cried ah I still tremble at the thought that you
were already in the Arno

But you saved me I replied tenderly You hovered over the
waters and smiled and your smile called me back to life

                            

I have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies
silently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles I feel
like one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium or
like a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that
momentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe
shore

                            

I hate this Florence where you have been so unhappy she
declared as I was saying good-night to her I want to leave
immediately tomorrow you will be good enough to write a couple of
letters for me and while you are doing that I will drive to the
city to pay my farewell visits Is that satisfactory to you

Of course you dear sweet beautiful woman

                            

Early in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept
Her tenderness is positively wonderful I should never have believed
that she could be so tender

                            

She has now been gone for over four hours I have long since
finished the letters and am now sitting in the gallery looking down
the street to see whether I cannot discover her carriage in the
distance I am a little worried about her and yet I know there is
no reason under heaven why I should doubt or fear However a feeling
of oppression weighs me down and I cannot rid myself of it It is
probably the sufferings of the past days which still cast their
shadows into my soul

                            

She is back radiant with happiness and contentment

Well has everything gone as you wished I asked tenderly kissing
her hand

Yes dear heart she replied and we shall leave to-night Help
me pack my trunks

                            

Toward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her
letters myself I took her carriage and was back within an hour

Mistress has asked for you said the negress with a grin as I
ascended the wide marble stairs

Has anyone been here

No one she replied crouching down on the steps like a black cat

I slowly passed through the drawing-room and then stood before her
bedroom door

Why does my heart beat so Am I not perfectly happy

Opening the door softly I draw back the portiere Wanda is lying on
the ottoman and does not seem to notice me How beautiful she looks
in her silver-gray dress which fits closely and while displaying
in tell-tale fashion her splendid figure leaves her wonderful bust
and arms bare

Her hair is interwoven with and held up by a black velvet ribbon
A mighty fire is burning in the fire-place the hanging lamp casts
a reddish glow and the whole room is as if drowned in blood

Wanda I said at last

Oh Severin she cried out joyously I have been impatiently
waiting for you She leaped up and folded me in her arms She sat
down again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her
side but I softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her
lap

Do you know I am very much in love with you to-day she whispered
brushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes

How beautiful your eyes are I have always loved them as the best
of you but to-day they fairly intoxicate me I am all  She
extended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath
her red lashes

And you you are cold you hold me like a block of wood wait I'll
stir you with the fire of love she said and again clung fawningly
and caressingly to my lips

I no longer please you I suppose I'll have to be cruel to you
again evidently I have been too kind to you to-day Do you know you
little fool what I shall do I shall whip you for a while 

But child 

I want to

Wanda

Come let me bind you she continued and ran gaily through the
room I want to see you very much in love do you understand Here
are the ropes I wonder if I can still do it

She began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind
my back pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner

So she said with gay eagerness Can you still move

No

Fine 

She then tied a noose in a stout rope threw it over my head and
let it slip down as far as the hips She drew it tight and bound me
to a pillar

A curious tremor seized me at that moment

I have a feeling as if I were about to be executed I said with a
low voice

Well you shall have a thorough punishment to-day exclaimed Wanda

But put on your fur-jacket please I said

I shall gladly give you that pleasure she replied She got her
kazabaika and put it on Then she stood in front of me with
her arms folded across her chest and looked at me out of half-closed
eyes

Do you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius she asked

I remember it only vaguely what about it

A courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of
Syracuse It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were
to be shut and then pushed into a mighty furnace

As soon as the iron ox began to get hot and the condemned person
began to cry out in his torment his wails sounded like the bellowing
of an ox

Dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor and to put his
invention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox

It is a very instructive story

It was you who innoculated me with selfishness pride and cruelty
and you shall be their first victim I now literally enjoy having a
human being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power
I love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I
especially a man who loves me

Do you still love me

Even to madness I exclaimed

So much the better she replied and so much the more will you
enjoy what I am about to do with you now

What is the matter with you I asked I don't understand you
there is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day and you are
strangely beautiful completely Venus in Furs

Without replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me
I was again seized by my fanatical passion

Where is the whip I asked

Wanda laughed and withdrew a couple of steps

You really insist upon being punished she exclaimed proudly
tossing back her head

Yes

Suddenly Wanda's face was completely transformed It was as if
disfigured by rage for a moment she seemed even ugly to me

Very well then you whip him she called loudly

At the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black
curls through the curtains of her four-poster bed At first I was
speechless petrified There was a horribly comic element in the
situation I would have laughed aloud had not my position been at
the same time so terribly cruel and humiliating

It went beyond anything I had imagined A cold shudder ran down my
back when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots his
tight-fitting white breeches and his short velvet jacket and I saw
his athletic limbs

You are indeed cruel he said turning to Wanda

Only inordinately fond of pleasure she replied with a wild sort
of humor Pleasure alone lends value to existence whoever enjoys
does not easily part from life whoever suffers or is needy meets
death like a friend

But whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the
ancient world he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others
he must never feel pity he must be ready to harness others to his
carriage or his plough as though they were animals He must know how to
make slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does and use them for
his service and pleasure without remorse It is not his affair whether
they like it or whether they go to rack and ruin He must always
remember this that if they had him in their power as he has them they
would act in exactly the same way and he would have to pay for their
pleasure with his sweat and blood and soul That was the world of the
ancients pleasure and cruelty liberty and slavery went hand in hand
People who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of necessity have
slaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds and gladiators who will
do battle the while they banquet and they must not mind if by chance a
bit of blood bespatters them

Her words brought back my complete self-possession

Unloosen me I exclaimed angrily

Aren't you my slave my property replied Wanda Do you want me
to show you the agreement

Untie me I threatened otherwise  I tugged at the ropes

Can he tear himself free she asked He has threatened to kill me

Be entirely at ease said the Greek testing my fetters

I shall call for help I began again

No one will hear you replied Wanda and no one will hinder me
from abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game
with you she continued repeating with satanic mockery phrases from
my letter to her

Do you think I am at this moment merely cruel and merciless or am
I also about to become cheap What Do you still love me or do you
already hate and despise me Here is the whip  She handed it to the
Greek who quickly stepped closer

Don't you dare I exclaimed trembling with indignation I won't
permit it 

Oh because I don't wear furs the Greek replied with an ironical
smile and he took his short sable from the bed

You are adorable exclaimed Wanda kissing him and helping him
into his furs

May I really whip him he asked

Do with him what you please replied Wanda

Beast I exclaimed utterly revolted

The Greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the
whip His muscles swelled when he drew back his arms and made the
whip hiss through the air I was bound like Marsyas while Apollo was
getting ready to flay me

My look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling
where Samson lying at Delilah's feet was about to have his eyes put
out by the Philistines The picture at that moment seemed to me like
a symbol an eternal parable of passion and lust of the love of man
for woman Each one of us in the end is a Samson I thought and
ultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves
whether he wears an ordinary coat or sables

Now watch me break him in said the Greek He showed his teeth
and his face acquired the blood-thirsty expression which startled
me the first time I saw him

And he began to apply the lash so mercilessly with such frightful
force that I quivered under each blow and began to tremble all over
with pain Tears rolled down over my cheeks In the meantime Wanda
lay on the ottoman in her fur-jacket supporting herself on her arm
she looked on with cruel curiosity and was convulsed with laughter

The sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes
of an adored woman cannot be described I almost went mad with shame
and despair

What was most humiliating was that at first I felt a certain wild
supersensual stimulation under Apollo's whip and the cruel laughter
of my Venus no matter how horrible my position was But Apollo
whipped on and on blow after blow until I forgot all about poetry
and finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage and cursed my wild
dreams woman and love

All of a sudden I saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion
and lust have led man ever since Holofernes and Agamemnon into a
blind alley into the net of woman's treachery into misery slavery
and death

It was as though I were awakening from a dream

Blood was already flowing under the whip I wound like a worm that
is trodden on but he whipped on without mercy and she continued to
laugh without mercy In the meantime she locked her packed trunk and
slipped into her travelling furs and was still laughing when she
went downstairs on his arm and entered the carriage

Then everything was silent for a moment

I listened breathlessly

The carriage door slammed the horse began to pull the rolling of
the carriage for a short time then all was over

                            

For a moment I thought of taking vengeance of killing him but I
was bound by the abominable agreement So nothing was left for me to
do except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth

                            

My first impulse after this the most cruel catastrophe of my life
was to seek laborious tasks dangers and privations I wanted to
become a soldier and go to Asia or Algiers but my father was old and
ill and wanted me

So I quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his
burdens and learned how to look after the estate which I had never
done before To labor and to do my duty was comforting like a
drink of fresh water Then my father died and I inherited the estate
but it meant no change

I had put on my own Spanish boots and went on living just as
rationally as if the old man were standing behind me looking over
my shoulder with his large wise eyes

One day a box arrived accompanied by a letter I recognized Wanda's
writing

Curiously moved I opened it and read

Sir 

Now that over three years have passed since that night in Florence
I suppose I may confess to you that I loved you deeply You
yourself however stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and
your insane passion From the moment that you became my slave I knew
it would be impossible for you ever to become my husband However
I found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own person
and while I gloriously amused myself perhaps to cure you

I found the strong man for whom I felt a need and I was as happy
with him as I suppose it is possible for any one to be on this
funny ball of clay

But my happiness like all things mortal was of short duration
About a year ago he fell in a duel and since then I have been living
in Paris like an Aspasia 

And you Your life surely is not without its sunshine if you have
gained control of your imagination and those qualities in you have
materialized which at first so attracted me to you your clarity of
intellect kindness of heart and above all else your moral
seriousness

I hope you have been cured under my whip the cure was cruel but
radical In memory of that time and of a woman who loved you
passionately I am sending you the portrait by the poor German

Venus in Furs

I had to smile and as I fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly
stood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine with the
whip in her hand And I continued to smile at the woman I had once
loved so insanely at the fur-jacket that had once so entranced me
at the whip and ended by smiling at myself and saying The cure was
cruel but radical but the main point is I have been cured

                            

And the moral of the story I said to Severin when I put the
manuscript down on the table

That I was a donkey he exclaimed without turning around for he
seemed to be embarrassed If only I had beaten her

A curious remedy I exclaimed which might answer with your
peasant-women 

Oh they are used to it he replied eagerly but imagine the
effect upon one of our delicate nervous hysterical ladies 

But the moral

That woman as nature has created her and as man is at present
educating her is his enemy She can only be his slave or his despot
but never his companion This she can become only when she has
the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work

At present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil and I
was the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him do you
understand

The moral of the tale is this whoever allows himself to be
whipped deserves to be whipped

The blows as you see have agreed with me the roseate supersensual
mist has dissolved and no one can ever make me believe again that
these sacred apes of Benares Footnote One of Schopenhauer's
designations for women or Plato's rooster Footnote Diogenes
threw a plucked rooster into Plato's school and exclaimed Here
you have Plato's human being are the image of God
